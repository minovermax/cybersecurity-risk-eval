{"cik": "225648", "company": "COVANTA HOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19\nOur activities were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and there remains a risk that our activities could be further impacted in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects remain dynamic, whether those effects are local, nationwide or global. Matters outside our control may prevent us from executing on our existing operations or projects in development, limit travel of Company representatives, adversely affect the health and welfare of Company personnel or prevent important vendors and contractors from performing normal and contracted activities.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the national and global economy and commodity and financial markets, and while some markets have stabilized, others remain under pressure and there continues to be a risk that the pandemic and its effects could worsen further. The full extent and near- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be unknown and to date has included extreme volatility in financial markets, a significant slowdown in economic activity, extreme volatility in commodity prices (including energy and metals prices) and the potential for a global recession. The response to COVID-19 has led to significant restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines, global stock market volatility and a general reduction in consumer and construction activity globally. Matters outside our control have affected our business and operations and may begin or may continue to: prevent us from executing on our existing operations and projects in development; limit travel of Company representatives, including between our corporate headquarters in New Jersey and between and among our facilities across the U.S. and in other countries; adversely affect the health and welfare of our personnel; or prevent important vendors and contractors from performing normal and contracted activities, including waste-to-energy operations, maintenance and construction activities. While we have been successful to date in maintaining operations, if significant portions of our workforce were to be unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, travel restrictions, facility closures, social distancing requirements or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be materially impacted. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could also cause further disruption in our supply chains, adversely affect our business partners, delay our construction activities or cause other unpredictable events.\nThe spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S., Canada and the UK has forced and may continue to force many of our employees to work from home and may result in employees missing work if they or a member of their family contract COVID-19, which could harm our operations and negatively impact our financial condition. We may also be prevented from receiving goods or services from contractors. While the impacts of COVID-19 did affect our business, including reductions in waste volumes at times and some project delays, we have generally been able to maintain operations and project development activities. Decisions beyond our control, such as canceled events, restricted travel, quarantines, barriers to entry or other factors may affect our ability in the future to operate our waste-to-energy plants and delay ongoing or planned construction projects in the UK, financing activities, and other needs that would normally be accomplished without such limitations. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may, in the future, impact our operations, our business and the economy is highly uncertain; however, a dramatic downturn in commercial activity in the markets in which we operate may reduce the amount of waste available for delivery to our waste-to-energy facilities, adversely impacting revenues from waste processing, metals recovery, and power generation. We cannot predict the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA long-term decline in our stock price may result in impairment charges.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact to the economy have caused global stock price volatility and some companies' stock prices dropped considerably. If there is an extended period of lower stock market valuations or an extended global recession which adversely impacts revenues generated from our waste processing facilities, we may be required to perform additional impairment tests for our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, which may result in material impairment charges.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our strategic review which may adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition.\nOn October 29, 2020, we announced a comprehensive strategic review of the Company\u2019s operations, growth priorities, and capital structure. We cannot assure that this strategic review will result in the identification and successful execution of any particular strategies or transactions, and the process of conducting the strategic review will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of additional costs and expenses. In addition, speculation and uncertainty regarding the strategic review process may cause or result in disruption of our business; distraction of our employees; difficulty in recruiting, hiring, motivating, and retaining talented and skilled personnel; difficulty in maintaining or negotiating and consummating new business or strategic relationships or transactions; and increased stock price volatility. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by the strategic review process, it may adversely affect our business or adversely impact our net sales, revenues, operating results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute divestitures, which could have adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing assets and businesses and may divest assets or businesses that no longer fit our strategic plans or investment return criteria. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial condition. We may be unable to divest assets or businesses on satisfactory terms or within planned time frames or at all. Divestitures may dilute our earnings, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers, including adverse claims under indemnification obligations in transaction agreements.\nWe may be unable to identify acquisition opportunities and successfully execute acquisitions and integrations, which could have adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes.\nOur ability to grow revenue, earnings, and free cash flow depends in part on our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth and synergies. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company. If we make acquisitions, it could have adverse financial and accounting impacts, such as asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations, distract management and place a strain on our management systems and infrastructure and resources, as well as present new or different risks to our business. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to identify acquisition opportunities for growth or manage and integrate acquisitions successfully.\nExposure to energy, waste disposal, recycled metal and commodity prices may affect our results of operations.\nSome of the electricity and steam we sell and most of the recycled metals we sell, are subject to market price volatility. Changes in the market prices for electricity and steam in particular can be affected by changes in natural gas prices, weather conditions and other market variables, while recycled metals prices are affected by general economic conditions and global demand for construction, goods and services. Similarly, the portion of waste processing capacity which is not under contract may be subject to volatility, principally as a result of general economic activity and waste generation rates, as well as the availability of alternative disposal sites and the cost to transport waste to alternative disposal. Volatility with respect to each of these revenue categories could adversely impact our businesses\u2019 profitability and financial performance. We may not be successful in our efforts to mitigate our exposure to price swings relating to these revenue streams.\nWe may experience volatility in the market prices and availability of commodities we purchase, such as reagents, chemicals and fuel. Any price increase, delivery disruption or reduction in the availability of such supplies could affect our ability to operate the facilities and impair our cash flow and results of operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to mitigate our exposure to supply and price swings for these commodities.\nThe energy industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and we might not successfully respond to these changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to respond in a timely or effective manner to the changes resulting in increased competition in the energy industry in global markets. These changes may include deregulation of the electric utility industry in some markets, privatization of the electric utility industry in other markets and increasing competition in all markets. To the extent competitive\npressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of a commodity business, the economics of our business may be subject to greater volatility and we might not timely or successfully respond to these changes. If this were to happen and we did not timely and successfully respond, such competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nContracts to provide new services or services through new or different methods involves significant risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we enter into contracts to provide new services or services through new or different methods, such as our waste transportation and disposal contract with New York City, new projects under development in the UK, our acquired environmental services businesses, or new facilities for processing metals and/or ash, we may face additional operating risks which could impact our results of operations and financial condition. These may include:\n\u2022performance by multiple contractors critical to our ability to perform under our new customer agreements;\n\u2022logistics associated with transportation of waste via barge, rail or other methods with which we have limited experience;\n\u2022reliance on joint venture parties or technology providers with whom we have limited experience; and\n\u2022risks associated with providing new materials handling or treatment services.\nOperation of our businesses involves significant risks, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nThe operation of our businesses involves many risks, including:\n\u2022supply or transportation interruptions;\n\u2022the breakdown, failure or unplanned maintenance or repair of equipment or processes;\n\u2022difficulty or inability to find suitable replacement parts for equipment;\n\u2022the unavailability of sufficient quantities of waste or fuel;\n\u2022fluctuations in the heating value of the waste we use for fuel at our WtE facilities;\n\u2022failure or inadequate performance by critical contractors or subcontractors;\n\u2022disruption in the transmission of electricity generated;\n\u2022labor disputes and work stoppages;\n\u2022unforeseen engineering and environmental problems;\n\u2022unanticipated cost overruns;\n\u2022weather interferences and catastrophic events including fires, explosions, earthquakes, droughts, pandemics and acts of terrorism; and\n\u2022the exercise of the power of eminent domain.\nWe cannot predict the impact of these risks on our business or operations. One or more of these risks, if they were to occur, could prevent us from meeting our obligations under our operating contracts and have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by market conditions existing at the time our contracts expire.\nFor the WtE facilities that we own or lease, the contracts pursuant to which we provide waste services and sell energy output expire on various dates between 2021 and 2053. Expiration of these contracts subjects us to greater market risk in entering into new or replacement contracts at pricing levels that may not generate comparable revenue. We cannot assure that we will be able to enter into renewal or replacement contracts on favorable terms, or at all. We also expect that medium- and long-term contracts for sales of energy may be less available than in the past. As a result, after expiration of existing contracts, we expect to sell our energy output either in short-term transactions or on a spot basis or pursuant to new contracts which may subject us to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing revenue. As a result, following the expiration of our existing medium and long-term contracts, we may have more exposure on a relative basis to market risk, and therefore revenue fluctuations, in energy markets than in waste markets.\nWhere we have leasehold interests, we cannot assure that market conditions prevailing when such interests expire will allow us to enter into an extension or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to us.\nOur revenue and cash flows may decline if we are not successful in retaining rights to operate facilities after our contracts expire or such rights otherwise terminate.\nWe operate some facilities owned by public sector clients, under long-term contracts. If, when existing contracts expire, we are unable to reach agreement with certain of our municipal clients on terms acceptable to us to extend our operating contracts, this may adversely affect our revenue, cash flow and profitability. We cannot assure that we will be able to enter into such renewal contracts or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to us.\nAt a limited number of facilities we operate that are owned by public sector clients, our clients have certain rights to terminate such contracts without cause. If any such terminations were to occur, this may adversely affect our revenue, cash flow and profitability. We cannot assure that such contract terminations will not occur in the future.\nDevelopment and construction of new projects and expansions may not commence as anticipated, or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and financial condition.\nDevelopment and construction involves many risks including:\n\u2022difficulties in identifying, obtaining and permitting suitable sites for new projects;\n\u2022the inaccuracy of our assumptions with respect to the cost of and schedule for completing construction;\n\u2022difficulty, delays or inability to obtain financing for a project on acceptable terms;\n\u2022delays in deliveries of, or increases in the prices of, equipment sourced from other countries;\n\u2022the unavailability of sufficient quantities of waste or other fuels for startup;\n\u2022permitting and other regulatory issues, license revocation and changes in legal requirements;\n\u2022labor disputes and work stoppages;\n\u2022unforeseen engineering and environmental problems;\n\u2022interruption of existing operations;\n\u2022unanticipated cost overruns or delays;\n\u2022weather interferences and catastrophic events including fires, explosions, earthquakes, droughts, pandemics and acts of terrorism; and\n\u2022reliance on third party contractors for performance.\nIn addition, new facilities have no operating history and may employ recently developed technology and equipment. A new facility may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its debt service obligations or may operate at a loss. In certain situations, if a facility fails to achieve commercial operation, at certain levels or at all, termination rights in the agreements governing such facility's financing may be triggered, rendering all of the facility\u2019s debt immediately due and payable. As a result, the facility may be rendered insolvent and we may lose our interest in the facility, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and financial condition.\nConstruction activities may cost more and take longer than we estimate.\nThe design and construction of new projects or expansions requires us to contract for services from engineering and construction firms, and make substantial purchases of equipment such as boilers, turbine generators and other components that require large quantities of steel to fabricate. These are complex projects that include many factors and conditions which may adversely affect our ability to successfully compete for new projects, or construct and complete such projects on time and within budget.\nOur revenue and cash flows may be subject to greater volatility if we extend or renew our contracts under tip fee structures more often than service fee structures.\nOur revenue and cash flows may be subject to greater volatility if we extend or renew our contracts under tip fee structures more often than under service fee structures. Due to the nature of tip fee structures, if that were to occur, we may be exposed to greater performance and price risk on the waste that we process and the energy that we sell.\nOur Tip Fee WtE projects involve greater risk of exposure to performance levels which, if not satisfied, could result in materially lower revenue.\nAt our WtE facilities where tip fee structures exist, we receive 100% of the energy revenue they generate. As a result, if we are unable to operate these facilities at their historical performance levels for any reason, our revenue from energy sales could materially decrease.\nWe depend on our senior management and key personnel and we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified professionals which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur future operating results depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of key senior managers and personnel. In addition, we are dependent on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. There is significant competition for employees with the requisite level of experience and qualifications. If we cannot attract, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we may be unable to compete effectively and our growth may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nChanges in technology may have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nTraditional waste streams are a critical resource for our business. Research and development activities are ongoing to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to manage waste, produce or extract by-products from waste, or to produce power. We and many other companies are pursuing these technologies, and capital is being invested to find new approaches to waste management, waste treatment, and renewable power generation. It is possible that this deployment of capital may lead to advances in these or other technologies which will reduce the cost of waste management or power production to a level below our costs and/or provide new or alternative methods of waste management or energy generation that become more accepted than those we currently utilize. Unless we are able to participate in these advances and therefore continue to successfully compete in our markets, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and the value of our existing facilities.\nOur ability to optimize our operations depends in part on our ability to compete for and obtain solid waste for fuel for our facilities, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur WtE facilities depend on solid waste for fuel, which provides a source of revenue. For some of our WtE facilities, the availability of solid waste to us, as well as the tipping fee that we charge to attract solid waste to our facilities, is impacted by competition from a number of sources such as other WtE facilities, landfills and transfer stations competing for waste in the market area. In addition, as our long-term contracts expire at our owned facilities, we may need to obtain waste at new market competitive prices, which could decrease our revenue. There has been consolidation, and there may be further consolidation, in the solid waste industry that would reduce the number of solid waste collectors or haulers that are competing for disposal facilities or enable such collectors or haulers to use wholesale purchasing to negotiate favorable below-market rates. The consolidation in the solid waste industry has resulted in companies with vertically integrated collection activities and disposal facilities. Such consolidation may result in economies of scale for those companies, as well as the use of disposal capacity at facilities owned by such companies or by affiliated companies. Such activities can affect both the availability of waste to us for processing at some of our WtE facilities and market pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully manage organizational, process and cost-efficiency initiatives could strain our resources and adversely affect our profitability.\nWe have made and expect to continue to undertake organizational, process and cost efficiency changes intended to improve our business. These changes, which may include implementation of new systems and processes, staff adjustments and reassignments of responsibilities, are important to our business success. Failure or delay in implementing these actions, or ineffective implementation could strain our resources and systems, resulting in disruption to our business and/or adversely affecting our results.\nOur waste operations are concentrated in one region and expose us to regional economic or market declines.\nThe majority of our waste disposal facilities are located in the northeastern U.S., primarily along the Washington, D.C. to Boston, Massachusetts corridor. Adverse economic developments in this region could affect regional waste generation rates and demand for waste management services provided by us. Adverse market developments caused by additional waste processing\ncapacity in this region could adversely affect waste disposal pricing. Either of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash generation.\nExposure to international economic and political factors may have a material adverse effect on our international businesses.\nOur international operations expose us to political, legal, tax, currency, inflation, convertibility and repatriation risks, as well as potential constraints on the development and operation of potential business, any of which can limit the benefits to us from international projects.\nThe financing, development, construction and operation of projects outside the U.S. can entail significant political and financial risks, which vary by country, including:\n\u2022changes in law or regulations;\n\u2022changes in electricity pricing;\n\u2022changes in foreign tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes in U.S. federal, state and local laws, including tax laws, related to foreign operations;\n\u2022compliance with, and potential penalties resulting from non-compliance with, applicable domestic and foreign corrupt practices laws;\n\u2022changes in government policies or personnel;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions affecting each country, including conditions in financial markets;\n\u2022changes in treaties among countries affecting importation of equipment or movement of people across borders;\n\u2022changes in labor relations in operations outside the U.S.;\n\u2022political, economic or military instability and civil unrest;\n\u2022expropriation and confiscation of assets and facilities; and\n\u2022credit quality of entities that pay for our services or purchase our power.\nThe legal and financial environment in foreign countries in which we currently own assets or projects could also make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects.\nAny or all of the risks identified above with respect to our international projects could adversely affect our projected costs, profitability and cash generation. As a result, these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to execute on our new project pipeline in the United Kingdom may be disrupted by Brexit.\nNotwithstanding the trade deal reached with the EU on December 24, 2020, there currently remains substantial uncertainty regarding whether any agreements negotiated as part of Brexit will have an adverse impact on the UK economy. Depending on a variety of factors, which we are currently unable to predict, Brexit could have adverse consequences on our ability to implement our development plans in the UK. Potential impacts of Brexit on our UK development plans could include (i) disruptions in our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms to finance our pipeline of new WtE projects in the UK, (ii) increases in our construction costs (or potential construction delays) where that construction requires importing equipment or materials or use of non-UK labor resource, (iii) decreases in the value of our operating investments because of a devaluation of the British pound against other currencies, and (iv) other adverse consequences that we cannot presently predict because of material uncertainties regarding the precise impact and results of the execution of Brexit.\nChanges in climate conditions could materially affect our business and prospects.\nSignificant changes in weather patterns and volatility could have a negative influence on our existing business and our prospects for growing our business. Such changes may cause episodic events (such as hurricanes, floods or storms) that are difficult to predict or prepare for, or longer-term trends (such as droughts or sea-level rise). These or other meteorological changes could lead to damages to our facilities, increased operating costs, capital expense, disruptions in facility operations or supply chains, changes in waste generation and interruptions in waste deliveries, limited availability of water for plant cooling operations, and changes in energy pricing, among other effects. We cannot quantify in advance the impact if such events were to occur, but, depending on the size of their impact, they could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Information Systems Security\nOur information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. These risks may take the form of malware, computer viruses, cyber threats, extortion, employee error, malfeasance, system errors or other types of risks, and may occur from inside or outside of our organization. Cybersecurity risk is increasingly difficult to identify and quantify and cannot be fully mitigated because of the rapidly evolving nature of the threats, targets and consequences. Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our third-party service providers, employees or vendors. Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our suppliers protect networks, equipment, information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems and software against damage from a number of threats. We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other services in connection with our operations. Our operations depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of our and our vendors' networks, equipment, IT systems and software. However, if we or our vendors are unable to or delayed in maintaining, upgrading or replacing IT systems and software, the risk of a cybersecurity incident could materially increase. Any of these and other events could result in information system failures, delays and/or increases in capital expenses. The failure of information systems or a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nIn addition, targeted attacks on our systems (or on systems of third parties that we rely on), failure or non-availability of a key IT system or a breach of security measures designed to protect our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations through delays or the corruption and destruction of our data, personal injury, property damage, loss of confidential information or financial or reputational risks. As the threat landscape is ever-changing, we must make continuous mitigation efforts, including: risk prioritized controls to protect against known and emerging threats; tools to provide automated monitoring and alerting; and backup and recovery systems to restore systems and return to normal operations. However, there can be no assurance that our ability to monitor for or mitigate cybersecurity risks will be fully effective, and we may fail to identify cybersecurity breaches or discover them in a timely way.\nAny significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nConcentration of suppliers and customers may expose us to heightened financial risk.\nOur waste and energy services businesses often rely heavily on a single supplier or single customer at our facilities, exposing such facilities to financial risks if one of these suppliers or customers should fail to perform its obligations.\nFor example, our businesses often rely on a single supplier to provide waste, fuel, water and other services required to operate a facility and on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility\u2019s output. The financial performance of these facilities depends on such customers and suppliers continuing to perform their obligations under their long-term agreements. A facility\u2019s financial results could be materially and adversely affected if any one customer or supplier fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and we are unable to find other customers or suppliers to produce the same level of profitability. We cannot provide assurances that such performance failures by third parties will not occur, or that if they do occur, such failures will not have a material adverse effect on the cash flows or profitability of our businesses.\nIn addition, we rely on the public sector clients as a source not only of waste for fuel, but also of revenue from the fees for waste services we provide. Because our contracts with public sector clients are generally long-term, we may be adversely affected if the credit quality of one or more of our public sector clients were to decline materially.\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2.5 billion of total consolidated indebtedness. The level of our consolidated indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022making it difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, new projects, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness under our credit facilities;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our consolidated debt, and the price of our common stock.\nThe inability of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that sufficient future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise, to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness depends on our ability to receive dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries in the future. This, in turn, is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022the continued operation and maintenance of our facilities, consistent with historical performance levels;\n\u2022maintenance or enhancement of revenue from renewals or replacement of existing contracts and from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities;\n\u2022market conditions affecting waste disposal and energy pricing, as well as competition from other companies for contract renewals, expansions and additional contracts, particularly after our existing contracts expire;\n\u2022the continued availability of the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards; and\n\u2022general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors.\nOur credit facilities and the indentures for our other corporate debt contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit facilities and the indentures for our other corporate debt contain operating and financial restrictions and covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and require us to meet certain financial tests. Complying with these covenant restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions or activities, including incurring additional indebtedness, making certain investments and distributions, and selling certain assets.\nAs a result of these covenant restrictions, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, the failure to comply with these covenants may result in a default under our credit facilities and other corporate debt. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders under our credit facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such credit facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness under our credit facilities, they would trigger a cross-default on most, if not all, of our other corporate debt, and we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nDislocations in credit and capital markets and increased capital constraints on banks may make it more difficult for us to borrow money or raise capital needed to finance the construction of new projects, expand existing projects, acquire certain businesses and refinance our existing debt.\nOur business is capital intensive, and we seek to finance a significant portion of our existing assets, as well as our investments in new assets, with debt capital to the extent that we believe such financing is prudent.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.5 billion in long-term debt and project debt outstanding. Prolonged instability or deterioration in the bank credit and/or debt and equity capital markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain refinancing of our existing debt on favorable terms, or at all. Such circumstances could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or the share price of our common stock.\nOur businesses generate their revenue primarily under long-term contracts and must avoid defaults under those contracts in order to service their debt and avoid material liability to contract counterparties.\nWe must satisfy performance and other obligations under contracts governing WtE facilities. These contracts typically require us to meet certain performance criteria relating to amounts of waste processed, energy generation rates per ton of waste processed, residue quantity and environmental standards. Our failure to satisfy these criteria may subject us to termination of operating contracts. If such a termination were to occur, we would lose the cash flow related to the projects and incur material termination damage liability, which may be guaranteed by us. In circumstances where the contract has been terminated due to our default, we may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to perform our respective obligations under such contracts in order to avoid such contract terminations, or damages related to any such contract termination, or that if we could not avoid such terminations that we would have the cash resources to pay amounts that may then become due.\nWe have provided guarantees and financial support in connection with our projects.\nWe are frequently obligated to guarantee or provide financial support for our projects in one or more of the following forms:\n\u2022support agreements in connection with construction, service or operating agreement-related obligations;\n\u2022direct guarantees of certain debt relating to our facilities or investments;\n\u2022contingent obligations to pay lease payment installments in connection with certain of our facilities;\n\u2022agreements to arrange financing for projects under development;\n\u2022contingent credit support for damages arising from performance failures;\n\u2022environmental indemnities; and\n\u2022contingent capital and credit support to finance costs, in most cases in connection with a corresponding increase in service fees, relating to uncontrollable circumstances.\nMany of these contingent obligations cannot readily be quantified, but, if we were required to provide this support, it could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur businesses depend on performance by third parties under contractual arrangements.\nOur waste and energy services businesses depend on a limited number of third parties to, among other things, purchase the electric and steam energy produced by our facilities, supply and deliver the waste and other goods and services necessary for the operation of our energy facilities, and purchase the metals we recover. The viability of our facilities depends significantly upon the performance by third parties in accordance with our contracts, and such performance depends on factors which may be beyond our control. If those third parties do not perform their obligations, or are excused from performing their obligations because of nonperformance by our waste and energy services businesses or other parties to the contracts, or due to force majeure events or changes in laws or regulations, our businesses may not be able to secure alternate arrangements on substantially the same terms, or at all. In addition, the bankruptcy or financial stability of third parties with whom we do business could result in nonpayment or nonperformance of that party\u2019s obligations to us.\nWe are subject to counterparty and market risk with respect to transactions with financial and other institutions.\nFollowing the expiration of our initial contracts to sell electricity from our projects, we expect to have on a relative basis more exposure to market risk, and therefore revenue fluctuations, in energy markets than in waste markets. Consequently, we may enter into futures, forward contracts, swaps or options with financial institutions to hedge our exposure to market risk in energy markets. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of these financial and other institutions.\nFuture impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance, we evaluate long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, could potentially indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Significant reductions in our expected revenue or cash flows for an extended period of time resulting from such events could result in future asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) will continue to be available to offset our federal tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $239 million of NOLs. NOLs offset our consolidated taxable income and $189 million will expire in various amounts, if not used, between 2033 and 2037 (the remainder has no expiration date). The NOLs are also used to offset income from certain grantor trusts that were established as part of the reorganization in 1990 of certain of our subsidiaries engaged in the insurance business and are administered by state regulatory agencies. As the administration of these grantor trusts concludes, taxable income could result, utilizing a portion of our NOLs and accelerating the date on which we may be otherwise obligated to pay incremental cash taxes.\nOur insurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenue, increased expenses or contractual liabilities.\nAlthough our businesses maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors, require contractors to meet certain performance levels and, in some cases, pass risks we cannot control to the service recipient or output purchaser, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties, performance guarantees or risk sharing arrangements may not be adequate to cover lost revenue, increased expense or contractual liabilities. If that were to occur, it could materially adversely impact our financial conditions and results of operations.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our credit facilities and our other corporate debt could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of our credit facilities and our other corporate debt could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of our credit facilities and our other corporate debt will have the right to require Covanta Holding or Covanta Energy, as the case may be, to repurchase their corporate debt or repay the facilities, as applicable. In addition, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without requiring any stockholder approval, and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. All these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or discourage a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nCompliance with environmental laws, including changes to such laws, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, primarily relating to air, waste (including residual ash from combustion) and water. Costs relating to compliance with these laws and regulations are material to our business. If our businesses fail to comply with these regulations, our operations could be disrupted, our cash flow and profitability could be adversely affected, and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, damages and fines.\nIn addition, lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal, state, local and/or foreign regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs. Stricter environmental regulation of air emissions, solid waste handling or combustion, residual ash handling and disposal, and waste water discharge could materially affect our cash flow and profitability. Certain environmental laws make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from properties or facilities we currently or formerly owned or operated or properties to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Such liability is not limited to the cleanup of contamination we actually caused. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur liability relating to the remediation of contamination, including contamination we did not cause. For additional information on environmental regulation, see Item 1. Business - Regulation of Business.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations have been and could be revised or reinterpreted, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to occur. This may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our facilities into compliance, impose additional expense on our operations, limit our ability to operate at capacity, or at all, or otherwise impose structural changes to markets which would adversely affect our competitive positioning in those markets.\nSignificant policy shifts from a new administration could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Trump Administration made substantial changes in the areas of fiscal and tax policy, regulatory oversight of businesses, and restrictions on free trade, including significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly from China. Positions taken by the new Biden Administration and its rejection of Trump Administration policies could result in changes to social, political, regulatory and economic conditions in the U.S. or in laws and policies affecting investment in countries where we currently conduct business. In addition, these changes could result in additional costs associated with growing our international business. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that while some policies adopted by the new Biden administration will benefit us, others will negatively affect us.\nChanges in public policies and legislative initiatives relating to climate change, greenhouse gas regulation, and environmental justice could materially affect our business and prospects.\nThere has been substantial debate recently in the U.S. and abroad regarding environmental and energy policies affecting climate change, the outcome of which could have a positive or negative influence on our existing business and our prospects for growing our business. Congress and several states have considered legislation and/or regulations designed to increase the proportion of the nation\u2019s electricity that is generated from technologies considered \u201cclean\u201d or \u201crenewable\u201d, through mandatory generation levels, tax incentives, and other means. For those sources of green-house-gas \"GHG\" emissions that are unable to meet the required limitations, such legislation could impose substantial financial burdens. The Biden administration has indicated that it generally favors renewable energy technologies. Our business and future prospects could be adversely affected if renewable technologies we use were either (i) disfavored in any new laws or regulations pursued by the Biden administration, or (ii) not included among those technologies identified in any final laws or regulations as favoring renewable technologies, or not included in the state plans to reduce carbon emissions, and therefore not entitled to the benefits of such laws, regulations, or plans.\nAs recent events have brought a focus to social justice in our society, they have also revitalized the discussion in our cities about environmental justice. Addressing environmental stressors in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods is the subject of legislation and regulation in many states and a number of our facilities are located in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods. We cannot predict at this time the impact to our business but if our facilities are unable to operate it could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and materially affect our business prospects.\nOur reputation could be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our business in compliance with laws, or if our efforts to grow our business results in adverse publicity.\nIf we encounter regulatory compliance issues in the course of operating our businesses, we may experience adverse publicity, which may intensify if such non-compliance results in civil or criminal liability. This adverse publicity may harm our reputation, and result in difficulties in attracting new customers, or retaining existing customers.\nWith respect to our efforts to grow and maintain our business globally, we sometimes experience opposition from advocacy groups or others intended to halt our development or on-going business. Such opposition is often intended to discourage third parties from doing business with us and may be based on misleading, inaccurate, incomplete or inflammatory assertions. Our reputation may be adversely affected as a result of adverse publicity resulting from such opposition. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow and maintain our business.\nOur reputation could be adversely affected if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with U.S. or foreign anti-corruption laws or regulations.\nSome of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy to a greater extent than in the U.S. It is our policy to comply, and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply, with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nEnergy regulation could adversely affect our revenue and costs of operations.\nOur waste and energy services businesses are subject to extensive energy regulations by federal, state and foreign authorities. We cannot predict whether the federal, state or foreign governments will modify or adopt new legislation or regulations relating to the solid waste or energy industries. The economics, including the costs, of operating our facilities may be adversely affected by any changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation or any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements.\nIf our businesses lose existing exemptions under the Federal Power Act, the economics and operations of our energy projects could be adversely affected, including as a result of rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with respect to our output of electricity, which could result in lower prices for sales of electricity and increased compliance costs. In addition, depending on the terms of the project\u2019s power purchase agreement, a loss of our exemptions could allow the power purchaser to cease taking and paying for electricity under existing contracts. Additionally, as a result of recent changes promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where possible states may choose to make utilities pay variable energy rates for the output of our facilities, as opposed to the fixed rates that they have previously enjoyed. Such results could cause the loss of some or all contract revenue or otherwise impair the value of a project and could trigger defaults under provisions of the applicable project contracts and financing agreements. Defaults under such financing agreements could render the underlying debt immediately due and payable. Under such circumstances, we cannot assure that revenue received, the costs incurred, or both, in connection with the project could be recovered through sales to other purchasers.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect our operations.\nOur waste and energy services businesses are continually in the process of obtaining or renewing federal, state, local and foreign approvals required to operate our facilities. We may not always be able to obtain all required regulatory approvals, and we may not be able to obtain any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals or maintain all required regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with any required regulatory approvals, the operation of our facilities or the sale of electricity to third parties could be prevented, made subject to additional regulation or subject our businesses to additional costs or a decrease in revenue. Any of these events, if they were to occur, could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nWeakness in the economy may have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flow and our ability to grow our business.\nOur business is directly affected by economic slowdowns and general reduction in demand for goods and services. A weak economy generally results in reduced overall demand for waste disposal, recycled metal and energy production. Under such conditions, the pricing we are able to charge for our waste management services, and for our energy and recycled metals, may decline and/or experience increased volatility. In addition, many of our customers are municipalities and other public sector entities which may be adversely affected in an economic downturn due to reduced tax revenue. Consequently, some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us for similar volumes or at previous or increased rates.\nFurthermore, lower prices for waste disposal and energy production, particularly in the absence of energy policies which encourage renewable technologies such as WtE, may also make it more difficult for us to sell waste and energy services at prices sufficient to allow us to grow our business through developing and building new projects. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flow and profitability.\nExposure to foreign currency fluctuations may affect our results from operations or construction costs of facilities we develop in international markets.\nWe have sought to participate in projects where the host country has allowed the convertibility of its currency into U.S. dollars and repatriation of earnings, capital and profits subject to compliance with local regulatory requirements. As and if we grow our business in other countries and enter new international markets, we expect to invest substantial amounts in foreign currencies to pay for the construction costs of facilities we develop, or for the cost to acquire existing businesses or assets. Currency volatility in those markets, as well as the effectiveness of any currency hedging strategies we may implement, may impact the amount we are required to invest in new projects, as well as our reported results.\nOur controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nAny disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. While the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls, such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and such assumptions, while reasonable, may not take into account all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have in the past discovered, and may potentially in the future discover, areas of internal control over financial reporting that may require improvement. Whenever such a control deficiency is determined to exist, we could incur significant costs in remediation efforts implementing measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to a material weakness are remediated. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period, whether as a result of a newly- determined deficiency or because remediation efforts are ongoing, or if our independent auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.", "PERMNO": 76515, "SIC": 4950, "TIC": "CVA"}
