{"cik": "896429", "company": "USA TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses since inception and if we continue to incur losses, the price of our shares can be expected to fall.\nWe experienced losses from inception through June 30, 2012, and from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2020. For fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, we incurred a net loss of $40.6 million, $29.9 million, and $11.3 million, respectively. In light of our recent history of losses as well as the length of our history of losses, profitability in the foreseeable future is not assured. Until the Company\u2019s products and services can generate sufficient annual revenues, the Company will be required to use its cash and cash equivalents on hand and may raise capital to meet its cash flow requirements including the issuance of common stock or debt financing. Additionally, if we continue to incur losses in the future, the price of our common stock can be expected to fall.\nWe may require additional financing or find it necessary to raise capital to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to achieve our business plan.\nAt June 30, 2020, we had a net working capital surplus of $5.0 million and cash and cash equivalents of $31.7 million. We had net cash (used in) provided by operating activities of $(14.1) million, $(28.2) million, and $12.4 million for fiscal years ended 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Unless we maintain or grow our current level of operations, we may need additional funds to continue these operations. We may also need additional capital to respond to unusual or unanticipated non-operational events. Such non-operational events include but are not limited to shareholder class action lawsuits, government inquiries or enforcement actions that could potentially arise from the circumstances that gave rise to our restatements, extended filing delays in filing our periodic reports and the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Should the financing that we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nFailure to comply with any of the financial covenants under the Company\u2019s credit agreement could result in an event of default which may accelerate our outstanding indebtedness or other obligations and have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the \u201c2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement\u201d) for a $5 million secured revolving credit facility and a $15 million secured term facility, which includes an uncommitted expansion feature that allows the Company to increase the total revolving commitments and/or add new tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5 million. The obligations under the 2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's assets. The 2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company (i) to maintain an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, not less than 2.50 to 1.00 beginning October 1, 2020, not less than 2.75 to 1.00 beginning January 1, 2021 and 3.00 to 1.00 beginning April 1, 2021 and (ii) to maintain, as of the end of each of its fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, a total leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00.\nFailure to comply with the foregoing financial covenants, if not cured or waived, will result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owed under the 2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement and could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.\nWe cannot be certain that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the financial covenants in our 2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement or to remedy any defaults. In addition, in the event of any event of default and related acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make the accelerated payments required under the 2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues, results of operations, and net income.\nWe have derived, and believe we may continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from one large customer or a limited number of large customers. Customer concentrations for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nFor the year ended June 30,\nSingle customer\nTotal revenue\n%\n%\n%\nThe loss of such customers could materially adversely affect our revenues. Additionally, a major customer in one year may not purchase any of our products or services in another year, which may negatively affect our financial performance. We have offered, and may in the future offer, discounts to our large customers to incentivize them to continue to utilize our products and services. If we are required to sell products to any of our large customers at reduced prices or unfavorable terms, our results of operations and revenue could be materially adversely affected. Further, there is no assurance that our customers will continue to utilize our transaction processing and related services as our customer agreements are generally cancelable by the customer on thirty to sixty days\u2019 notice.\nWe depend on our key personnel and, if they leave us, or if we are unable to attract highly skilled personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on key management personnel, including the Chief Executive Officer, Sean Feeney, and the rest of the executive leadership team and several functional areas within the Company. The loss of services from these officers and employees could dramatically affect our business prospects. Our executive officers and certain of our officers and employees are particularly valuable to us because:\n\u2022\nthey have specialized knowledge about our company and operations\u037e\n\u2022\nthey have specialized skills that are important to our operations\u037e or\n\u2022\nthey would be particularly difficult to replace.\nWe have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Feeney, which contains customary restrictive covenants, including perpetual confidentiality, non-disparagement, and intellectual property covenants, as well as a non-compete, non-solicit of customers and suppliers, and non-solicit of employees (including a no-hire) that each apply during employment and for two years following any termination.\nOur success and future growth also depends, to a significant degree, on the skills and continued services of our management team, many of whom are recent hires, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and our General Counsel. Further, due to the complexity of the work required to make needed improvements within the Company, it may be difficult for us to retain these new hires and other existing senior management, sales personnel, and development and engineering personnel critical to our ability to execute our business plan, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. We may experience a loss of productivity due to the departure of key personnel and the associated loss of institutional knowledge, or while new personnel integrate into our business and transition into their respective roles. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel, including members of our management team.\nFurther, as a significant portion of the executive management team was recently externally hired, a significant amount of on-boarding and training is required to orient these personnel to the business. This risk is also compounded by the departure of several key functional leaders who possessed a deep knowledge of the legacy business, its systems and its processes. There is no assurance that we will be able to acclimate the new leadership team in a manner timely and adequate enough to ensure a successful transition.\nOur dependence on proprietary technology and limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nChallenge to our ownership of our intellectual property could materially damage our business prospects. Our technology may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary products, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the United States Government and other countries have granted us 130 patents, of which 72 are still in force. We had 10 pending United States and foreign patent applications, and will consider filing applications for additional patents covering aspects of our future developments, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain or prosecute these applications. There can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\nany of the remaining patent applications will be granted to us\u037e\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional products that are patentable or that do not infringe the patents of others\u037e\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products\u037e\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others\u037e or\n\u2022\nany of our products would not infringe the patents of others.\nIf any of our products or services is found to have infringed any patent, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to continue to manufacture, use, sell, and license such product or service or that we will not have to pay damages and/or be enjoined as a result of such infringement.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or fail to enforce or prosecute our patents against others, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could result in the loss of customers and our business being adversely affected. Patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs and diverts Company resources as well as the attention of our management. There can be no assurance we will have the necessary financial resources to appropriately defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights in connection with any such litigation.\nIf we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop new products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for cashless payments and cloud and mobile solutions for the self-service retail markets. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in proximity payment devices. These new services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently offer or the technologies we currently use to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. There can be no assurance that any new products or services we develop and offer to our customers will achieve significant commercial acceptance. Our ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payment card networks, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from our customers, or third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, because our products and services are designed to operate with a variety of systems, infrastructures, and devices, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in mobile, software, communication, and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure of our products and services to continue to operate effectively with third-party infrastructures and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction of our customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe termination of our relationships with certain third-party suppliers upon whom we rely for services that are critical to our products could adversely affect our business and delay achievement of our business plan.\nThe operation of our wireless networked devices depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of services provided to us by our wireless telecommunication services providers, AT&T Mobility and Verizon Wireless. In addition, if we terminate relationships with our current telecommunications service providers, we may have to replace hardware that is part of our existing ePort or Seed products that are already installed in the marketplace in order to make them compatible with a new network. This could significantly harm our reputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenues.\nSubstantially all of the network service contracts with our customers are terminable for any or no reason upon thirty to sixty days\u2019 advance notice.\nSubstantially all of our customers may terminate their network service contracts with us for any or no reason upon providing us with thirty or sixty days\u2019 advance notice. Accordingly, consistent demand for and satisfaction with our products by our customers is critical to our financial condition and future success. Problems, defects, or dissatisfaction with our products or services or competition in the marketplace could cause us to lose a substantial number of our customers with minimal notice. If a substantial number of our customers were to exercise their termination rights, it would result in a material adverse effect to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nSecurity is vital to our customers and therefore breaches in the security of transactions involving our products or services could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to transmit financial information of consumers making cashless transactions and to provide accounting and inventory management services to our customers. As such, the information we transmit and/or maintain are exposed to the ever-evolving threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by consumers, customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks, including annual validation of our compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact the marketplace acceptance of our products and services, and could result in significant remedial expenses to not only assess and repair any damage to our systems, but also to reimburse customers for losses that occur from the fraudulent use of confidential data. Additionally, we could become subject to significant fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nFurther, substantially all of the cashless payment transactions handled by our network involve Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa\u201d) or MasterCard International Incorporated (\"MasterCard\"). If we fail to comply with the applicable standards or requirements of the Visa and MasterCard card associations relating to security, Visa or MasterCard could suspend or terminate our registration with them. The termination of our registration with them or any changes in the Visa or MasterCard rules that would impair our registration with them could require us to stop providing cashless payment services through our network. In such event, our business plan and/or competitive advantages in the market place would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on other card payment processors, and if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services, our customer relationships could be adversely affected, and we could lose business.\nWe rely on agreements with other large payment processing organizations, primarily First Data, Chase Paymentech and Global Payments, Inc., formerly Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., to enable us to provide card authorization, data capture and transmission, settlement and merchant accounting services for the customers we serve. The termination by our card processing providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively will adversely affect our relationships with the customers whose accounts we serve and may cause those customers to terminate their processing agreements with us.\nDisruptions at other participants in the financial system could prevent us from delivering our cashless payment services.\nThe operations and systems of many participants in the financial system are interconnected. Many of the transactions that involve our cashless payment services rely on multiple participants in the financial system to accurately move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain. A disruption for any reason at one of the participants in the financial system could impact our ability to cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our services. Although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective. Such a disruption could lead to the inability for us to deliver services, reputational damage, lost customers and lost revenue, loss of customers\u2019 confidence, as well as additional costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, financial condition, and future growth.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that affect the products, services and markets in which we operate. Failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are, among other things, subject to banking regulations and credit card association regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in the suspension of our business, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and/or the imposition of fines that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on us or our product offerings. To the extent this occurs, we could be subject to additional technical, contractual or other requirements as a condition of our continuing to conduct our payment processing business. These requirements could cause us to incur additional costs, which could be significant, or to lose revenues to the extent we do not comply with these requirements.\nNew legislation could be enacted regulating the basis upon which interchange rates are charged for debit or credit card transactions, which could increase the debit or credit card interchange fees charged by bankcard networks. An example of such legislation is the so-called \u201cDurbin Amendment,\u201d an amendment to the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Durbin Amendment regulates the basis upon which interchange rates for debit card transactions are made to ensure that interchange rates are \u201creasonable and proportionate to costs.\u201d Pursuant to regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Reserve, Visa and MasterCard have significantly increased their interchange fees for small ticket debit card transactions.\nIncreases in card association and debit network interchange fees could increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nWe are obligated to pay interchange fees and other network fees set by the bankcard networks to the card issuing bank and the bankcard networks for each transaction we process through our network. From time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the organization and/or processing fees, known as interchange fees that they charge. Under our processing agreements with our customers, we are permitted to pass along these fee increases to our customers through corresponding increases in our processing fees. Passing along such increases could result in some of our customers canceling their contracts with us. Consequently, it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our Company absorbing some or all of the increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our gross profit and adversely affect our business.\nAs of July 1, 2017, we entered into a three-year agreement with Visa, pursuant to which Visa has agreed to continue to make available to the Company certain promotional interchange reimbursement fees for small ticket debit and credit card transactions. Similarly, MasterCard has agreed to make available to us reduced interchange rates for small ticket debit card transactions through March 1, 2019, and for successive one-year periods thereafter unless the agreement between the parties is terminated by either party upon sixty days' notice prior to the end of any such one-year renewal period. During the term of the Visa Agreement, the Company does not anticipate accepting any debit cards with interchange fees that are higher than the rates provided under the Visa Agreement. The Company will continue to accept Visa- and MasterCard- branded debit cards in addition to all major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express at its current processing rates. If the Visa or MasterCard Agreements are not extended, our financial results would be materially adversely affected unless we are able to pass these significant additional charges to our customers. The Company is having discussions with Visa on a new agreement.\nAny increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the event a dispute between a cardholder and a customer is not resolved in favor of the customer, the transaction is normally charged back to the customer and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. When we serve as merchant of record, if we are unable to collect such amounts from the customer's account, or if the customer refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have policies to manage customer-related credit risk and attempt to mitigate such risk by monitoring transaction activity. Notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause a loss of confidence in our financial reporting and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide accurate financial information. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in Item 9A., our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2020 due to the existence of a material weakness in such controls. Management believes the controls are designed appropriately and is in the process of remediating the material weakness. We cannot provide assurance that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will be effective as of June 30, 2021. If we are unable to adequately maintain our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affecting the trading price of our common stock, or our ability to access the capital markets.\nThe accounting review of our previously issued financial statements and the audits of prior fiscal years have been time-consuming and expensive, has resulted in the filing of class action lawsuits and the receipt of derivative demand letters, and may result in additional expense and/or litigation.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting advisors, conducted an internal investigation of then-current and prior period matters relating to certain of the Company\u2019s contractual arrangements, including the accounting treatment, financial reporting and internal controls related to such arrangements (the \u201c2019 Investigation\u201d). Additionally in fiscal year 2019, significant financial reporting issues were identified which were unrelated to the internal investigation and which resulted in further adjustments to the Company\u2019s previously issued or prior fiscal years\u2019 unissued financial statements. As a result of the findings, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year\n2017, our selected financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018.\nWe have incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the 2019 Investigation, the review of our accounting, the audits, the restatements of previously filed financial statements, bank consents, the remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the proxy solicitation, and professional services fees to assist the Company with accounting and compliance activities in fiscal year 2020 following the filing of the 2019 Form 10-K. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred $21.3 million and $16.1 million of those costs. To the extent that steps we are continuing to take to reduce errors in accounting determinations are not successful, we could be forced to incur significant additional time and expense. The incurrence of significant additional expense, or the requirement that management devote significant time that could reduce the time available to execute on our business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we have completed the restatement, we cannot guarantee that we will not receive inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory authorities regarding our restated financial statements or matters relating thereto, or that we will not be subject to future claims, investigations or proceedings. Any future inquiries from the SEC or other regulatory authorities, or future claims or proceedings or any related regulatory investigation will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our internal resources and result in additional legal and accounting costs.\nWe are also subject to a shareholder class action arising out of the misstatements in our financial statements or public filings. For additional discussion, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our management has been, and may in the future be, required to devote significant time and attention to this litigation, and this and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as well as on our reputation. While we cannot estimate our potential exposure in these matters at this time, we have already incurred significant expense defending this litigation and expect to continue to need to incur significant expense.\nWe and certain of our former officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits, which could require significant additional management time and attention, result in significant additional legal expenses or result in government enforcement actions.\nWe and certain of our former officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits, and may become subject to further litigation, government investigations or proceedings arising therefrom. The pending litigation has been, and any future litigation, investigation or other actions that may be filed or initiated against us or our former officers or directors may be time consuming and expensive. We cannot predict what losses we may incur in these litigation matters, and contingencies related to our obligations under the federal and state securities laws, or in other legal proceedings or governmental investigations or proceedings related to these matters.\nTo date, we have incurred significant costs in connection with pending litigation and with the special litigation committee proceedings. Any legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us, could result in significant monetary damages, penalties and reputational harm, and will likely involve significant defense and other costs. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers, and our bylaws require us to indemnify each of our directors and officers. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we have been and may continue to be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor additional discussion of these matters, refer to Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMatters relating to or arising from the restatement and the 2019 Investigation, including adverse publicity and potential concerns from our customers could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year 2017, our selected financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018. As a result, we have been and could continue to be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the restatement and adjustment of our financial statements, and may be adversely impacted by negative reactions from our customers or others with whom we do business. Concerns include the perception of the effort required to address our accounting and control environment\nand the ability for us to be a long-term provider to our customers. The continued occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, as a result of the restatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including substantial unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement. If litigation did occur, we may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of their outcome. Likewise, such events might cause a diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention. If we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs.\nMatters relating to recent Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) inquiries may require significant time and attention, result in substantial expenses and lead to adverse publicity.\nWe are and have been responding to inquiries from the DOJ related to the 2019 Investigation associated with fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015. While these inquiries to date relate to events that took place under prior management that was in place during those years, they will likely require time and attention from current management to provide access to any internal company records that may be requested.\nWe are unable to predict what consequences, if any, that the investigation performed by the DOJ may have on us. The investigation performed by the DOJ could result in substantial legal and accounting expenses, divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and harm our business. Any civil or criminal action commenced against us could result in administrative orders against us, the imposition of significant penalties and/or fines against us, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions against us or certain of our former officers, directors and/or employees. Any regulatory action could result in the filing of additional restatements of our prior financial statements or require that we take other actions. If we are subject to an adverse finding resulting from the investigation performed by the DOJ, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us. The period of time necessary to resolve the investigations by the DOJ is uncertain, and these matters could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business. Additionally, as a result of these inquiries, we could be the subject of negative publicity including negative reactions from our customers or others with whom we do business.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has and will continue to significantly and adversely impact our business.\nThe global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption on our business. Electronic payment transaction volume within unattended markets has decreased significantly since the pandemic accelerated in the United States in March 2020, as government authorities have imposed forced closure of non-essential businesses and social distancing protocols, significantly reducing foot traffic to distributed assets containing our electronic payment solutions and reducing discretionary spending by consumers.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; and the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response. Furthermore, even after containment measures are lifted there can be no assurance as to the time required to regain operations and sales at levels prior to the pandemic. There may also be increased marketplace consolidation as companies are challenged to respond to the COVID-19 impact.\nA sustained downturn may also result in a decrease in the fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets, causing them to exceed their carrying value. This may require us to recognize an impairment to those assets. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic could decrease consumer spending, adversely affect demand for our technology and services, cause one or more of our customers and partners to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, cause one or more of our customers to fail to renew, terminate, or renegotiate their contracts, affect the ability of our sales team to travel to potential customers, impact expected spending from new customers and negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In response to the outbreak, we have agreed to concessions on price and/or payment terms with certain customers who have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may negotiate additional concessions on price and/or payment terms.\nIt is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition at this time.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our recently received Paycheck Protection Program Loan, and our application for the Paycheck Protection Program Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we received loan proceeds of approximately $3.1 million (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). We intend to use the PPP Loan in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act. The PPP Loan, if not forgiven, bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, and is subject to the standard terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act.\nUnder the CARES Act, as amended in June 2020, loan forgiveness is generally available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the Covered Period, which is 8 weeks or 24 weeks (at the election of the Company) beginning on the date of the first disbursement of the PPP Loan. The amount of the PPP Loan eligible to be forgiven may be reduced in certain circumstances, including as a result of certain headcount or salary reductions. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness, that we will apply for forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA.\nIn order to apply for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, the maintenance of our workforce, our need for additional funding to continue operations, and our ability to access alternative forms of capital in the current market environment to offset the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this analysis, we believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the CARES Act. The certification described above is subject to interpretation.\nOn April 23, 2020, the SBA issued guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program has resulted in significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good-faith belief that given our circumstances we satisfied all eligible requirements for the PPP Loan, we are later determined to have not been in compliance with these requirements or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, we may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety and/or be subject to additional penalties. Should we be audited or reviewed by federal or state regulatory authorities as a result of filing an application for forgiveness of the PPP Loan or otherwise, such audit or review could result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention and the incurrence of additional costs. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to commercially manage the transition from the 3G network could lead to competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.\nWe will begin to plan transition away from the 3G network in 2021 as the network is being phased out in North America. This transition will affect a large portion of our active devices and will require a new customer retention initiative to ensure that our existing customer base is properly transitioned to the new platform. This change affects our industry and will also lead to changes with our competitors and their customers. Our ability to successfully transition and provide the new platform for our customers is critical to our strategy, our network and to the competitive balance in the marketplace.\nContinued dependence on external providers and advisors could limit our ability to decrease operating expenses.\nWe continue to incur substantial fees associated with a series of external consultants and advisors who are supporting us with on-going accounting and reporting requirements and continued litigation. Our dependence upon these external parties to execute and complete large on-going projects and legal matters and our inability to transition these projects to internal resources may have a continued adverse impact on operating costs.\nWe may not successfully implement our go-to-market strategy which may adversely affect growth and profitability.\nOur current core business is highly concentrated amongst several large customers in the vending industry. We have made inroads into other adjacent markets including laundry, gaming, entertainment and other commercial payments applications and continued expansion into these markets is a substantial piece of our potential future growth prospects. Changing technology, customer preferences, and competitor actions may limit our ability to successfully grow and expand beyond our core business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur securities were delisted from Nasdaq and are now quoted on the OTC Markets. There can be no assurance that our securities will be relisted, or once relisted, our securities might not remain listed.\nAs a result of our failure to comply with our periodic reporting obligations, on September 26, 2019, our securities were suspended from trading on Nasdaq. The Company\u2019s securities were delisted from Nasdaq on February 18, 2020 and are currently quoted on the OTC Markets. The Company has applied to relist its common stock and preferred stock on Nasdaq, and the application is currently under review by the staff of the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department. There can be no assurance that the listing application will be granted by Nasdaq or granted in a timely manner. If our securities are relisted, there can be no assurance that our securities will remain listed on Nasdaq.\nThe OTC Market is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq, and the quotation of our securities on the OTC Market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential shareholders to trade our securities. Securities traded in the OTC Market generally have less liquidity due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our securities may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. We may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws relating to the issuance of our securities. This could have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital, which ultimately could adversely affect the market price of our securities. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nUpon certain fundamental transactions involving the Company, such as a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, we may be required to distribute the liquidation preference then due to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock which would reduce the amount of the distributions otherwise to be made to the holders of our common stock in connection with such transactions.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that upon a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets or upon the disposition of more than 50% of our voting power, the holders of at least 60% of the preferred stock may elect to have such transaction treated as a liquidation and be entitled to receive their liquidation preference. Upon our liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference prior to any distribution to the holders of common stock which, as of June 30, 2020 was approximately $20.8 million.\nDirector and officer liability is limited.\nAs permitted by Pennsylvania law, our by-laws limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our by-law provisions and Pennsylvania law, shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, our by-laws and indemnification agreements entered into by the Company with each of the officers and directors provide that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly for any reason, including continued delisting of our securities by Nasdaq, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that, in some future period, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 91910, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "USAT"}
