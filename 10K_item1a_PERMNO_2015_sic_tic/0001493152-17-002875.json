RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this report, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If any of these risks occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company.\nWe were incorporated in Nevada in July 2013. We have significant financial resources and as of December 31, 2016, we have generated $2,776,435 in revenues and incurred net losses of $222,323. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:\n\u25cf our ability to market our product and services\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues; and\n\u25cf our ability to raise the capital necessary to continue marketing and developing our product.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm has previously expressed substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and future reports may similarly express a going concern.\nOur auditors indicated in their report on the Company\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 that conditions existed that raise a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015. A similar future \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives and/or negatively affect our relationships with customers and suppliers and/or negatively effect the willingness of our suppliers to allow us to maintain credit with them. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon our ability to grow our operations and integrate newly acquired assets and operations, our ability to acquire additional assets and operations, and our ability to improve operating margins and regain profitability. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and the Company may not be able to continue. If we ceased operations, it is likely that all of our investors would lose their investment.\nOur operating results may prove unpredictable which could negatively affect our profit.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which we have no control. Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly include: our inability to generate enough working capital from future equity sales; the level of commercial acceptance by clients of our services; fluctuations in the demand for our service the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure and general economic conditions.\nIf realized, any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for our service or establish a significant market presence, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nOur growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully market our service to prospective clients. However, our planned services may not achieve significant acceptance. Such acceptance, if achieved, may not be sustained for any significant period of time. Failure of our services to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations.\nManagement\u2019s ability to implement the business strategy may be slower than expected and we may be unable to generate a profit.\nOur business plans, including offering a cloud auditing system and consulting services, may be slow to develop or may not occur at all. Our services may be slow to achieve profitability, or may not become profitable at all, which will result in losses. We may be unable to enter into our intended markets successfully. The factors that could affect our growth strategy include our success in (a) developing our business plan, (b) obtaining our clients, (c) obtaining adequate financing on acceptable terms, and (d) adapting our internal controls and operating procedures to accommodate our future growth.\nCompetitors may enter this market with superior services which would adversely affect our business.\nWe have identified a market opportunity for our business. Potential competitors may enter this sector with superior services. This would have an adverse effect upon our business and the results of our operations. In addition, a high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and recurring sales of our services. Although we currently only have a limited number of customers, we may need to improve our platform and software in order to assist our potential customers in using our platform, and we also need to provide effective support to future clients. Our inability to make necessary improvements and upgrades to our platform in the event of the expansion of our business, would adversely affect the sale of our services to potential customers and would harm our reputation.\nOur use of open source and third-party software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our services.\nWe intend to incorporate open source software into our platform. Although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts or jurisdictions elsewhere, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our services. We could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products. In either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue our services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also intend to incorporate certain third-party technologies, including software programs, into our website and may need to utilize additional third-party technologies in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in releases of our platform until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Any disruption in our access to software programs or third-party technologies could result in significant delays in releases of our platform and could require substantial effort to locate or develop a replacement program. If we decide in the future to incorporate into our products any other software program licensed from a third party, and the use of such software program is necessary for the proper operation of our appliances, then our loss of any such license would similarly adversely affect our ability to release our products in a timely fashion.\nThe security of our computer systems may be compromised and harm our business.\nA significant portion of our business operations is conducted through use of our computer network. Although we intend to implement security systems and procedures to protect the confidential information stored on these computer systems, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties. As well, they may be able to create system disruptions, shutdowns or effect denial of service attacks. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our networks or client computers, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, or that misappropriate and distribute confidential information stored on these computer systems. Any of the foregoing could result in damage to our reputation and customer confidence in the security of our products and services, and could require us to incur significant costs to eliminate or alleviate the problem. Additionally, our ability to transact business may be affected. Such damage, expenditures and business interruption could seriously impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse developments in our existing areas of operation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur operations are focused on utilizing our sales efforts which are principally located in South-East Asia. As a result, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition depend upon the demand for our services in these regions. Due to our current lack of broad diversification in industry type and geographic location, adverse developments in our current segment of the midstream industry, or our existing areas of operation, could have a significantly greater impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition than if our operations were more diversified.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to follow the extended transition period, and as a result, we will delay adoption of certain new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in South-East Asia\nOur contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the variable interest entities as direct ownership.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities to hold part of our assets in Hong Kong. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see \u201cAcquisition and Reorganization History - VIE Structure And Arrangements.\u201d These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our variable interest entities.\nIf we had direct ownership of the variable interest entities, we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder directly to effect changes in the boards of directors of those entities, which could effect changes at the management and operational level. Under our contractual arrangements, we may not be able to directly change the members of the boards of directors of these entities and would have to rely on the variable interest entities and the variable interest entity equity holders to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the variable interest entities. The variable interest entity equity holders may have conflicts of interest with us or our shareholders, and they may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. For example, our variable interest entities and their respective equity holders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations, including maintaining our websites and using our domain names and trademarks which the relevant variable interest entities have exclusive rights to use, in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. Pursuant to the call option, we may replace the equity holders of the variable interest entities at any time pursuant to the contractual arrangements. Consequently, the contractual arrangements may not be as effective in ensuring our control over the relevant portion of our business operations as direct ownership.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nSubstantially all of our business operations are conducted in South-East Asia. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in the Asian countries we intend to develop business. Following the closing of our initial public offering, we will derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from the operation in Hong Kong, our principal business place, and also in Malaysia, China and other South-East Asian countries. Operating in multiple foreign countries involves substantial risk. For example, our business activities subject us to a number of laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and security requirements, labor laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, and anti-competition regulations. As we expand into additional countries, the complexity inherent in complying with these laws and regulations increases, making compliance more difficult and costly and driving up the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, make it more difficult or impossible to do business in that country and harm our reputation.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign corrupt practices act, and any determination that we violated the foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We will have operations, agreements with third parties and make sales in South-East Asia, which may experience corruption. Our proposed activities in Asia create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees, consultants, or sales agents of our Company, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It will be our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. Also, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, or sales agents of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nWe are a Nevada corporation and most of our assets are and will be located outside of the United States. Almost all of our operations will be conducted in Hong Kong. In addition, our officers and directors are nationals and residents of a country other than the United States. All of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon them. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officer and director, since he is not a resident in the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Hong Kong or other Asian countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts.\nPayment of dividends is subject to restrictions under Nevada and the PRC laws.\nUnder Nevada law, we may only pay dividends subject to our ability to service our debts as they become due and provided that our assets will exceed our liabilities after the dividend. Our ability to pay dividends will therefore depend on our ability to generate sufficient profits. In addition, because of the various rules applicable to our operations in China and the regulations on foreign investments as well as the applicable tax law, we may be subject to further limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe can give no assurance that we will declare dividends of any amounts, at any rate or at all in the future. The declaration of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial conditions, legal and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nWe have a limited public market for our shares of common stock and you may not be able to resell our shares at or above the price you paid, or at all.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock in the OTC Market. We cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will develop or that the market price of our shares will not decline below the public offering price. The public offering price of our shares may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market following the offering.\nTogether, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Chong Kuang, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert, own a large percentage of our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of our corporate matters.\nMr. Lee Chong Kuang, our CEO, beneficially owns 47.91% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert, our CFO, beneficially owns 44.76% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, Messrs. Lee and Loke are able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain shareholder approval, including the election of directors to our board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership in our shares by executive officers will limit the other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of the shares of common stock by existing shareholders could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIf our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of the shares, the market price of our common stock could fall. Such sales by our existing shareholders might make it more difficult for us to issue new equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and place we deem appropriate.\nThe market price of our shares is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf variations in our actual and perceived operating results;\n\u25cf news regarding gains or losses of customers or partners by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf news regarding gains or losses of key personnel by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of competitive developments, acquisitions or strategic alliances in our industry by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u25cf potential litigation;\n\u25cf general market conditions or other developments affecting us or our industry; and\n\u25cf the operating and stock price performance of other companies, other industries and other events or factors beyond our control.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the shares\nIn the event that our shares are traded, they may trade under $5.00 per share and thus will be a penny stock. Trading in penny stocks has many restrictions and these restrictions could severely affect the price and liquidity of our shares.\nIn the event that our shares are traded, and our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established Members and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Presently, we intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, to finance development and expansion of our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nFuture issuances of capital stock may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAny issuance of shares of our common stock after this offering could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue additional shares of common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions). Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock, and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17885, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "GRNQ"}
