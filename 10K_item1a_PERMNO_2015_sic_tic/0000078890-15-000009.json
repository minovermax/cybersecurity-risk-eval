RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in highly competitive industries.\nWe compete in industries that are subject to significant competition and pricing pressures in most markets. In addition, our business model requires significant fixed costs associated with offering many of our services including costs to operate a fleet of armored vehicles and a network of secure branches. Because we believe we have competitive advantages such as brand name recognition and a reputation for a high level of service and security, we resist competing on price alone. However, continued pricing pressure from competitors or failure to achieve pricing based on the competitive advantages identified above could result in lost volume of business and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, given the highly competitive nature of our industries, it is important to develop new solutions and product and service offerings to help retain and expand our customer base. Failure to develop, sell and execute new solutions and offerings in a timely and efficient manner could also negatively affect our ability to retain our existing customer base or pricing structure and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDecreased use of cash could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe proliferation of payment options other than cash, including credit cards, debit cards, stored-value cards, mobile payments and on-line purchase activity, could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and a decline in the need for physical bank branches and retail stores. To mitigate this risk, we are developing new lines of business and investing in adjacent security-related markets, but there is a risk that these initiatives may not offset the risks associated with our traditional cash-based business and that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nOur growth strategy may not be successful.\nOne element of our growth strategy is to expand our offerings to customers. We may not be successful in designing or marketing additional products and services to customers. In addition we may fail to achieve our strategic objectives and anticipated operating profit improvements, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States.\nWe currently serve customers in more than 100 countries, including 41 countries where we operate subsidiaries. Eighty percent (80%) of our revenues in 2014 came from operations outside the U.S. We expect revenues outside the U.S. to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues. Business operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems;\n\u00b7\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u00b7\nrequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nenforcement of our global compliance program in foreign countries with a variety of laws, cultures and customs;\n\u00b7\nvarying permitting and licensing requirements in different jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nforeign ownership laws;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u00b7\nthreat of nationalization and expropriation;\n\u00b7\nhigher costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nlaws or other requirements and restrictions associated with organized labor;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in equity, revenues and profits due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including measures taken by governments to devalue official currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\ninflation levels exceeding that of the U.S; and\n\u00b7\ninability to collect for services provided to government entities.\nWe are exposed to certain risks when we operate in countries that have high levels of inflation, including the risk that:\n\u00b7\nthe rate of price increases for services will not keep pace with the cost of inflation;\n\u00b7\nadverse economic conditions may discourage business growth which could affect demand for our services;\n\u00b7\nthe devaluation of the currency may exceed the rate of inflation and reported U.S. dollar revenues and profits may decline; and\n\u00b7\nthese countries may be deemed \u201chighly inflationary\u201d for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) purposes.\nWe manage these risks by monitoring current and anticipated political and economic developments, monitoring adherence to our global compliance program and adjusting operations as appropriate. Changes in the political or economic environments of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, our initiatives to drive efficiency and control costs.\nWe have launched a number of initiatives, including the 2014 Reorganization and Restructuring described on page 2, to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs. Although we have achieved annual cost savings associated with these initiatives, we may be unable to sustain the cost savings that we have achieved. In addition, if we are unable to achieve, or have any unexpected delays in achieving, additional cost savings, our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected. Even if we meet our goals as a result of these initiatives, we may not receive the expected financial benefits of these initiatives.\nWe may not be successful in pursuing strategic investments or acquisitions or realize the expected benefits of those transactions because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nWhile we may identify opportunities for investments to support our growth strategy, as well as acquisition and divestiture opportunities, our due diligence examinations and positions that we may take with respect to appropriate valuations for acquisitions and divestitures and other transaction terms and conditions may hinder our ability to successfully complete business transactions to achieve our strategic goals. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions will depend, in part, on successfully integrating each business with our company as well as improving operating performance and profitability through our management efforts and capital investments. The risks to a successful integration and improvement of operating performance and profitability include, among others, failure to implement our business plan, unanticipated issues in integrating operations with ours, unanticipated changes in laws and regulations, labor unrest resulting from union operations, regulatory, environmental and permitting issues, the effect on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and difficulties in fully identifying and evaluating potential liabilities, risks and operating issues. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our expected benefits of any acquisitions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets in the United States that may not be realized.\nDeferred tax assets are future tax deductions that result primarily from net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We have $287 million of U.S. deferred tax assets recorded at the end of 2014 primarily related to our retirement plan obligations. These future tax deductions may not be realized if tax rules change or if projected future taxable income is insufficient. Consequently, not realizing our U.S. deferred tax assets may significantly and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIt is possible that we will incur restructuring charges in the future.\nIt is possible that we will take restructuring actions in one or more of our markets in the future to reduce expenses. These actions could result in significant restructuring charges at these subsidiaries, including recognizing impairment charges to write down assets, and recording accruals for employee severance and the termination of operating leases. These charges, if required, could significantly and materially affect results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant retirement obligations. Poor investment performance of retirement plan holdings and / or lower interest rates used to discount the obligations could unfavorably affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have substantial pension and retiree medical obligations, a portion of which have been funded. The amount of these obligations is significantly affected by factors that are not in our control, including interest rates used to determine the present value of future payment streams, investment returns, medical inflation rates, participation rates and changes in laws and regulations. The funded status of the primary U.S. pension plan was approximately 88% as of December 31, 2014. Based on actuarial assumptions at the end of 2014, we do not expect to make any contributions in the future. A change in assumptions could result in funding obligations that could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to use our resources to make acquisitions and to otherwise grow our business.\nWe have $721 million of actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the end of 2014. These losses relate to changes in actuarial assumptions that have increased the net liability for benefit plans. These losses have not been recognized in earnings. These losses will be recognized in earnings in future periods to the extent they are not offset by future actuarial gains. Our projections of future cash requirements and expenses for these plans could be adversely affected if our retirement plans have additional actuarial losses.\nOur earnings and cash flow could be materially affected by increased losses of customer valuables.\nWe purchase insurance coverage for losses of customer valuables for amounts in excess of what we consider prudent deductibles and/or retentions. Insurance is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms. Coverage is available to us in major insurance markets, although premiums charged are subject to fluctuations depending on market conditions. Our loss experience and that of other companies in our industry affects premium rates. We are not insured for losses below our coverage limits and recognize expense up to these limits for actual losses. Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and various other exclusions typical for such policies. The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in obtaining and retaining customers and managing the risks of our business. If our losses increase, or if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Venezuelan government recently announced a new currency exchange process, known locally as \u201cSIMADI.\u201d The new process is expected to replace the existing SICAD II exchange process. We currently use the SICAD II rate to measure our Venezuelan operations for our financial statements. We have not yet concluded whether the new rate will be used for our financial statements. We expect the exchange rate under the proposed exchange will be much less favorable than current rates, which could adversely affect our reported results for our Venezuelan operations in future years.\nThe new SIMADI currency exchange is expected to exchange Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars at rates significantly less favorable than the current SICAD II exchange rates. The SICAD II rates have approximated 50 bolivars to the U.S. dollar since its inception in March 2014. At December 31, 2014, we held $12.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $10.9 million other net monetary assets denominated in bolivars based on the official exchange rate we use to remeasure our Venezuelan operations. The SIMADI rate has ranged from 170 to 174 bolivars to the dollar between February 12 and February 26. Had we used a rate of 170, our revenues in 2014 would have declined by $183 million and our operating profit before items not allocated to segments would have declined by $39 million. Had a rate of 170 been in effect at December 31, 2014, we would have recognized additional currency losses to write down our net monetary assets of $16 million.\nCurrency restrictions in Venezuela limit our ability to use earnings and cash flows outside of Venezuela and may negatively affect ongoing operations in Venezuela.\nBecause most of our past requests to convert bolivars to dollars have not been approved and certain past processes to obtain dollars are no longer available, we do not expect to be able to repatriate cash from Venezuela for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we do not expect to be able to use cash held in Venezuela for any purpose outside of that country, including reducing our U.S. debt, funding growth or business acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders.\nWe believe that currency exchange restrictions in Venezuela may disrupt the operation of our business in Venezuela because we may be unable to pay for goods and services that are required to be paid in dollars. This could reduce our ability to provide services to our customers in Venezuela, or could increase the cost of delivering the services, which would negatively affect our earnings and cash flows, and could result in a loss of control, deconsolidation, shutdown or loss of the business in Venezuela.\nCurrency restrictions in Argentina may require us to use more expensive methods to repatriate earnings.\nThe Argentinean government has, from time-to-time, imposed limits on the exchange of local pesos into U.S. dollars. As a result, we have elected in the past and may elect in the future to repatriate cash from Argentina using alternative legal methods, which may result in less favorable exchange rates. At December 31, 2014, our Argentinean operations held $6.6 million in Argentinean pesos.\nWe have risks associated with confidential information.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential information, including information about individuals. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of third-party service providers and business partners, could be vulnerable to security breaches (including cybersecurity breaches), acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or by third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNegative publicity to our name or brand could lead to a loss of revenues or profitability.\nWe are in the security business and our success and longevity are based to a large extent on our reputation for trust and integrity. Our reputation or brand, particularly the trust placed in us by our customers, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual breaches in our ability to conduct our business ethically, securely and responsibly. Any damage to our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailures of our IT system could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology (IT) infrastructure. Significant problems with our infrastructure, such as telephone or IT system failure, cybersecurity breaches, or failure to develop new technology platforms to support new initiatives and product and service offerings, could halt or delay our ability to service our customers, hinder our ability to conduct and expand our business and require significant remediation costs. In addition, we continue to evaluate and implement upgrades to our IT systems. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate these risks through testing, training, and staging implementation. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in regulated industries.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation with respect to safety of operations and equipment and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities and interprovincial operations in Canada are subject to regulation by Canadian and provincial regulatory authorities. Our international operations are regulated to varying degrees by the countries in which we operate. Many countries have permit requirements for security services and prohibit foreign companies from providing different types of security services.\nChanges in laws or regulations could require a change in the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations were to change or we failed to comply, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur inability to access capital or significant increases in our cost of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing depends on our credit ratings as well as the liquidity of financial markets. A negative change in our ratings outlook or any downgrade in our current investment-grade credit ratings by the rating agencies could adversely affect our cost and/or access to sources of liquidity and capital. Additionally, such a downgrade could increase the costs of borrowing under available credit lines. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to access short-term and long-term capital. Our access to funds under short-term credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the participating banks to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Longer disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital needed for our business.\nWe are subject to covenants for our credit facilities and for our unsecured notes.\nOur credit facilities as well as our unsecured notes are subject to financial covenants, including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, limits on the ability to pledge assets, limits on the total amount of indebtedness we can incur, limits on the use of proceeds of asset sales and minimum coverage of interest costs. Although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by changes in our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that we will meet these covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under existing credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities, the lenders could cause amounts outstanding to be immediately payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. The occurrence of these events would have a significant effect on our liquidity and cash flows.\nOur effective income tax rate could change.\nWe operate subsidiaries in 41 countries, all of which have different income tax laws and associated income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate can be significantly affected by changes in the mix of pretax earnings by country and the related income tax rates in those countries. In addition, our effective income tax rate is significantly affected by the ability to realize deferred tax assets, including those associated with net operating losses. Changes in income tax laws, income apportionment, or estimates of the ability to realize deferred tax assets, could significantly affect our effective income tax rate, financial position and results of operations. We are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have certain environmental and other exposures related to our former coal operations.\nWe may incur future environmental and other liabilities in connection with our former coal operations, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\nGrowing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we are subject. Some form of federal regulation may be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or \"cap and trade\" legislation. The outcome of this legislation may result in new regulation, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions. Compliance with these actions could result in the creation of additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased fuel prices or additional taxes or emission allowances. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations from our customers, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the potential effects of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect our operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains both historical and forward-looking information.
