{"cik": "275119", "company": "BAYLAKE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements other than historical facts contained or incorporated by reference in this report. These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d or \u201canticipates,\u201d references to estimates or similar expressions. Future filings by us with the SEC, and future statements other than historical facts contained in written material, press releases and oral statements issued by us, or on our behalf, may also constitute forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ from the results discussed above include, but are not limited to, the Risk Factors set forth below and any other risks identified in this report or in other filings we may make with the SEC. All forward-looking statements contained in this report or which may be contained in future statements made for or on our behalf are based upon information available at the time the statement is made and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock contains a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K, including the matters addressed under the caption \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d above, you should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. If any of the events highlighted in the following risks actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe to be important to you, materialize, our business, results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Lending and Credit Activities\nWe are subject to lending concentration risks.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 73.3% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, real estate construction and commercial real estate loans (collectively, \u201ccommercial loans\u201d). Commercial loans are generally viewed as having more inherent risk of default than residential mortgage loans or retail loans. Also, the commercial loan balance per borrower is typically larger than that for residential mortgage loans and retail loans, inferring higher potential losses on an individual loan basis. Because the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains a number of larger commercial loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonaccrual loans, which could result in a loss of interest income from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in loan charge offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, as our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans decline.\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, upon local and national economic and political conditions, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as an economic recession, rising unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore our earnings. Because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings. Consequently, any decline in the economy in our market area could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWeakness in the markets for residential or commercial real estate, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, could reduce our net income and profitability.\nReal estate values and the demand for commercial real estate loans have not fully recovered from the recent recession, which generally lasted from 2007 through 2009. There can be no assurance that the economy will not enter into another recession, whether in the near term or long term. Significant declines in real estate values in Northeastern Wisconsin coupled with the impact of any future possible economic downturns and high unemployment levels, could drive losses beyond the levels provided for in our allowance for loan losses, in which case our future earnings would be adversely affected.\nAdditional declines in real estate values and home sales within Northeastern Wisconsin, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, or other factors, could have further adverse effects on borrowers that might result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient.\nTo address risks inherent in our loan portfolio, we maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that may occur within our existing loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of various factors, including industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. Determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make estimates of significant credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In evaluating our impaired loans, we assess repayment expectations and determine collateral values based on all information that is available to us. However, we must often make subjective decisions based on our assumptions about the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the collateral.\nContinuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically examine our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management.\nIf charge-offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan losses, we will need to take additional loan loss provisions to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any additional loan loss provisions will reduce our net income or increase our net loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with collateral securing our real estate lending.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property, from time to time we may find it necessary to foreclose on and take title to properties securing such loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on those properties. If such substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. We may also be required to incur substantial expenses that could materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future environmental laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we are careful to perform environmental reviews on properties prior to foreclosure, our reviews may not detect all environmental hazards.\nWe rely on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers or counterparties, and inaccurate or incomplete information could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information provided to us by such customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or that are inaccurate or misleading.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. There are many factors which influence interest rates that are beyond our control including, but not limited to, general economic conditions and governmental policy, in particular, the policies of the FRB. Any changes in such policies, including changes in interest rates, could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings.\nSuch changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average maturity of our securities portfolio. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain of our borrowers to repay their obligations. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. Earnings would also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nManagement uses various methods to monitor interest rate risk and believes it has implemented effective asset and liability strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations. Management also periodically adjusts our mix of assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk. However, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe mortgage-backed securities in which we invest are subject to several types of risk.\nWe invest in mortgage-backed securities that evidence interests in, or are secured by, a single mortgage loan or a pool of mortgage loans. Accordingly, these securities are subject to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans. In a rising interest rate environment, the value of mortgage-backed securities may be adversely affected when payments on underlying mortgages do not occur as anticipated, resulting in the extension of the security\u2019s effective maturity and the related increase in interest rate sensitivity of a longer-term instrument. The value of mortgage-backed securities may also change due to shifts in the market\u2019s perception of issuers and regulatory or tax changes adversely affecting the mortgage-backed securities market as a whole. In addition, mortgage-backed securities are subject to the credit risk associated with performance of the underlying mortgage properties. Mortgage-backed securities are issued by investment banks, not financial institutions, and while the loans that are pooled to create the security carry government agency guarantees, the securities themselves are not insured or guaranteed by the United States government. Finally, mortgage-backed securities are also subject to geographic risk when the mortgages underlying the securities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. This risk is managed by monitoring the geographic dispersion of the underlying loans in each security. As of December 31, 2014, the highest concentration of loans secured by 1-4 family homes issued in any state was issued in California and those loans represented approximately 5.8% of the total amount we had invested in mortgage-backed securities as of that date.\nAlthough we generally invest in mortgage-backed securities collateralized by residential loans, the value of such securities can be negatively impacted by any dislocation in the mortgage-backed securities market in general. During the recent economic downturn, the mortgage-backed securities market suffered from a severe dislocation created by mortgage pools that included sub-prime mortgages secured by residential real estate.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities, which fair values may not be realizable if we were to sell those securities today.\nIn assessing whether any impairment of investment securities we hold is other-than-temporary, management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Any such determination of other-than-temporary impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nImpairment of deferred income tax assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Assessing the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence, both negative and positive. Positive evidence necessary to overcome the negative evidence includes whether future taxable income in sufficient amounts and character within the carry back and carry forward periods is available under the tax law, including the use of tax planning strategies. When negative evidence (e.g. cumulative losses in recent years, history of operating loss or tax credit carry forwards expiring unused) exists, more positive evidence than negative evidence will be necessary. At December 31, 2014, net deferred tax assets are approximately $4.7 million. If a valuation allowance becomes necessary with respect to such balance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nImpairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nUnder current accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A decline in our stock price or occurrence of a triggering event following any of our quarterly earnings releases and prior to the filing of the periodic report for that period could, under certain circumstances, cause us to perform a goodwill impairment test and result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period that was not reflected in such earnings release. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital. At December 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $7.2 million, representing about 6.8% of stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our local markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nOur operations are geographically limited and are more at risk for downturns in those areas.\nOur financial performance generally is highly dependent upon the business environment in Northeastern Wisconsin, particularly in Door and Brown Counties. As a result of this geographical concentration, we are more vulnerable to downturns or other factors that affect the local economy or decrease demand for our services than if our operations were conducted over a wider area. Other local factors, such as natural disasters and the local regulatory climate, could also significantly affect our results because of our lack of geographical diversity.\nThe overall economic environment evident during 2014 remained challenging for many households and businesses in Northeast Wisconsin and the business environment of the markets in which we operate have been adversely affected. In our market area, especially in Door County, a significant percentage of our customer base is in the tourism industry, particularly lodging and restaurants and many other of our customers depend indirectly on the tourism industry. With this concentration in a single industry, any downturn, deterioration of the economy or other issues affecting local tourism could reduce the demand for our services, increase problem loans and thus disproportionately have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for certain information system, data management and processing services and to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe outsource certain information system and data management and processing functions to third party service providers. These third party service providers are also sources of operational and information system interruptions or breaches, and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If third party service providers encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our business.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, we cannot be assured that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do, that they will be addressed adequately. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, which could increase our cost structure or have other negative impacts on our operations.\nWe are highly regulated by both federal and state regulatory authorities. Regulation includes, among other things, capital and reserve requirements, permissible investments and lines of business, dividend limitations, limitations on products and services offered, loan limits, geographical limits, consumer credit regulations, community reinvestment requirements and restrictions on transactions with affiliated parties. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF, our depositors and the public, rather than our stockholders. We are also subject to regulation by the SEC. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanction by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any change in government regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices. Compliance with any such change may impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services, such as the Bank.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The concept of what may be considered to be an \u201cabusive\u201d practice is relatively new under the law. Moreover, while the Bank will not be directly supervised and examined by the CFPB for compliance with the CFPB\u2019s regulations and policies, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, the FRB, will be responsible for oversight and examination of such regulations and policies. The costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory reporting regimen have yet to be fully determined, although they may be material and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the Bank with respect to its consumer product offering and services may produce significant, material effects on the Bank\u2019s (and our) profitability.\nWe are subject to examinations and challenges by taxing authorities.\nIn the normal course of business, we are routinely subjected to examinations and challenges from federal and state taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with our investments and the businesses in which we engage. Federal and state taxing authorities have recently become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property or income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax planning. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocations of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience unanticipated losses as a result of residential mortgage loan repurchase or reimbursement obligations under agreements with secondary market purchasers.\nWe may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans, or to reimburse the purchaser for losses with respect to residential mortgage loans, which have been sold to secondary market purchases in the event there are breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements, such as representations and warranties related to credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. Consequently, we are exposed to credit risk, and potentially funding risk, associated with sold loans. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to repurchase from or reimburse secondary market purchasers for any loans sold or that the total losses incurred, if any, on such repurchases or reimbursements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nExternal Risks\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be heightened when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon liquidation or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition may affect our results.\nWe face strong competition in originating loans, in seeking deposits and in offering our other services. We must compete with commercial banks, savings associations, trust companies, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms. Our market area is also served by several commercial banks and savings associations that are substantially larger than us in terms of deposits and loans and have greater human and financial resources.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships; (ii) our ability to expand our market positions; (iii) the scope, relevance and pricing of our products and services offered to meet customer needs; (iv) the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors; (v) customer satisfaction with our level of service; and (vi) industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operation.\nCustomers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could result in a loss of income to us.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions using non-banks that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction. For example, customers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits.\nActs or threats of terrorism and political or military actions by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic industry conditions.\nGeopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions and, as a result, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nMaintaining or increasing our market share may depend on lowering prices and market acceptance of new products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nFuture growth or operating results may require us to raise additional capital but that capital may not be available.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. To the extent our future operating results erode capital or we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisition, we may be required to raise capital.\nOur ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nReputation Risks\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer system or otherwise, could severely harm our business.\nAs part of our financial and data processing products and services, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human error, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and/or harm our business.\nEthics or conflict of interest issues could damage our reputation.\nWe have established a Code of Conduct and related policies and procedures to address the ethical conduct of business and to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based, in part, on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our related controls and procedures or failure to comply with the established Code of Conduct could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nLiquidity Risks\nWe could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed liquidity.\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. We seek to ensure our funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity through asset/liability management. If we become unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank for most of our revenues.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. Historically, we have received substantially all of our revenue in the form of dividends from the Bank. Federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us. Also, a holding company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us when needed, we may not be able to service our debt or pay our obligations, including dividends on the Trust Preferred Stock and Convertible Promissory Notes (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). Any inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nThe price of our securities can be volatile.\nPrice volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell your securities when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our securities prices can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations or financial conditions;\n\u2022\noperating results and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitment by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, or credit loss trends could also cause our securities prices to decrease regardless of our operating results. In addition, while our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), there is limited trading activity in the stock. As such, relatively small trades may have a significant impact on the price of our stock.\nOur securities are not an insured deposit.\nSecurities issued by us are not a bank deposit and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Securities are subject to investment risk, and investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.\nYou may not receive dividends on your investment in our common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends is dependent upon our receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is subject to regulatory restrictions. Such restrictions, which govern state-chartered banks, generally limit the payment of dividends on bank stock to the bank\u2019s undivided profits after all payments of all necessary expenses, provided that the bank\u2019s surplus equals or exceeds its capital. In addition, under the terms of our junior subordinated debentures, we would be precluded from paying dividends on our common stock if we were in default under the debentures, if we exercised our right to defer payments of interest on the debentures, or if certain related defaults occurred. After temporarily suspending the payment of dividends on our common stock in February 2008, our Board of Directors announced in January 2012 that it would be resuming the payment of dividends. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue paying dividends to our shareholders and if we do, in what amounts. Total dividends declared and paid in 2013 were $0.22 per share. During 2014, total dividends of $0.30 per share were declared and paid.\nThe holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nOn March 31, 2006, we issued $16.1 million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a $16.1 million trust preferred securities issuance by our subsidiary, Baylake Capital Trust II. The 2006 junior subordinated debentures mature in June of 2036. The purpose of the transaction was to raise additional capital in order for us to redeem our trust preferred securities issued by our subsidiary Baylake Capital Trust I. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by us. The junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock. We are currently paying dividends on the junior subordinated debentures in accordance with their terms.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional securities, including common stock and securities that are convertible or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or the issuance of convertible securities would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of an equity offering, as well as other sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market after an equity offering, or the perception that such sales could occur.\nDuring 2009 and 2010, we issued $9.5 million of our 10% Convertible Notes due June 30, 2017 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) and, as of December 31, 2014, we had $1.7 million of Convertible Notes outstanding. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a rate of one share for every $5.00 in aggregate principal amount outstanding (the \u201cConversion Ratio\u201d), or an aggregate 330,000 shares, at the holders\u2019 discretion. The issuance of common stock in conjunction with any such conversion of our Convertible Notes will further dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders, and may adversely impact the market price of our shares.\nThe holders of our convertible notes have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nThe Convertible Notes are senior to our junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities, as well as shares of our common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our Convertible Notes must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock or junior subordinated debentures.", "PERMNO": 14303, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BYLK"}
