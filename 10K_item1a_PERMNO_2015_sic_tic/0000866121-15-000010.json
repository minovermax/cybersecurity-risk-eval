{"cik": "866121", "company": "ORBITAL ATK, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks, including those related to being a U.S. Government contractor and those related to domestic and international commercial sales. The material risks facing the Company are discussed below.\nThe Company's business could be adversely impacted by reductions or changes in NASA or U.S. Government military spending.\nAs a substantial portion of the Company's sales are to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors, the Company depends heavily on the contracts underlying these programs. Significant portions of the Company's sales come from a small number of contracts. The military small-caliber ammunition contract, which is reported within Defense Systems Group, contributed 13%, 9% and 19% to the Company's sales in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other single contract contributed more than 10% of our sales in fiscal 2015. The Company's top five contracts, all of which are contracts with the U.S. Government, accounted for approximately 30% of fiscal 2015 sales. The loss or significant reduction of a material program in which the Company participates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nU.S. Government contracts are dependent on the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, at the outset of a major program, the contract is usually incrementally funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as Congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years. In addition, most U.S. Government contracts are subject to modification if funding is changed. Key programs in which the Company participates must compete with other programs for consideration during the federal budgeting and appropriation process, and support and funding for any U.S. Government program may be influenced by general economic conditions, political considerations and other factors. A decline in U.S. Government support and funding for programs in which the Company participates could result in contract terminations, delays in contract awards, the failure to exercise contract options, the cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe government budget structure remains constrained by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which initially reduced the DoD topline budget by approximately $490 billion over 10 years starting in fiscal year 2012, and subsequent amendments that continue to keep DoD spending flat or down compared to previous years. Budget pressures, such as rising personnel costs despite significant force reductions in the Army and Marine Corps, present challenges to modernization and research and development accounts. The Company is experiencing a period where force reductions and a winding-down of overseas contingency operations, coupled with reduced training cycles and fairly healthy inventory levels for many ammunition and missile items, are resulting in less demand in some categories of products, a trend which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.\nIn December 2014, Congress approved, and the President signed, an omnibus spending bill for the remainder of Government Fiscal Year (\"GFY15\"), removing the threat of future government shutdowns and the difficulties of operating under a continuing resolution for GFY15. Total GFY15 funding, including funding for most DoD programs, remain flat at GFY14 levels. NASA funding received a modest increase for the GFY15 budget, including an increase in the budget for the SLS program, for which the Company is a key supplier. However, continuing concerns about deficit spending, along with ongoing economic challenges, continue to place pressure on U.S. Government budgets. In addition, should a continuing resolution be used to fund U.S. Government operations after GFY15 or should the threat of sequestration remain a concern, such uncertainties may cause government contract awards to be delayed, canceled or funded at lower levels. The Company has several significant U.S. government contracts or subcontracts, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which could negatively impact the financial condition and operating results of the Company if they were canceled or funded at reduced levels.\nIn the event NASA were to cancel the SLS program, the Company believes that it will be reimbursed for certain amounts previously incurred by the Company, as well as amounts to be incurred by the Company, as part of that termination, (e.g., severance, environmental liabilities, and termination administration). There can be no assurance, however, that the Company would be successful in collecting reimbursement of any termination liability costs. As of March 31, 2015, the Company had $56 million of net property, plant, and equipment and other assets related to the SLS program and other contracts, and $440 million of goodwill recorded related to the Flight Systems Group. These assets would be subject to impairment testing if significant changes are made to the SLS program and related contracts in future periods.\nThe Company's CRS I contract with NASA to deliver cargo to the International Space Station is a significant part of the Company's business. On October 28, 2014, Orbital's Antares launch vehicle that was carrying the Company's unmanned Cygnus spacecraft on a cargo delivery mission to the ISS for NASA under Orbital's CRS I contract experienced a launch failure shortly after liftoff from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The accident investigation board's review is ongoing and the final outcome of such review cannot be assured. The ultimate impact of the Antares incident on the Company depends upon a number of factors and circumstances, as described herein.\nThe Company has developed plans to fulfill its obligations to deliver all remaining cargo to the ISS under the CRS I contract. However, there can be no assurance that the planned future Cygnus missions will occur on the contemplated timetable or will be successful. The Company believes that its plans will allow it to deliver all of the required cargo under the CRS I contract in four future Cygnus missions to the ISS rather than the five that had been previously planned. The Company expects the increased costs associated with the use of one or two non-Antares launch vehicles to be substantially offset by the cost savings of delivering the requisite cargo to the ISS using one less Cygnus mission (four instead of five). However, the assumptions underlying the estimated increase in costs and the amount of cost savings are inherently uncertain and, although considered reasonable by the management of the Company, are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the estimates. In addition, the ability to achieve cost savings will depend on the ability of the Company's subcontractors to deliver necessary components on-budget and in a timely manner. Given the right of U.S. Government customers to terminate contracts for convenience, there can be no assurance that the remaining backlog for this contract will ultimately be recognized in the Company's revenue. NASA could cancel this contract\nfor any reason, including as a result of reductions in appropriations or our failure to achieve milestones due to technical issues or delays resulting from the Antares launch failure. A cancellation of the CRS I contract could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nThe Company's small-caliber ammunition operations for the U.S. military and U.S. allies are conducted at the LCAAP in Independence, Missouri. Lake City is the Army's principal small-caliber ammunition production facility and is the primary supplier of the U.S. military's small-caliber ammunition needs. The Company took over operation of this facility in 2000 and is responsible for the operation and management, including leasing excess space to third parties in the private sector. In September 2012, the Company was awarded a new contract for the continued production of ammunition and continued operation and maintenance of LCAAP. The production contract runs through September 2019 and the facility contract runs through September 2020, with an option to extend the contract to 2023. As a result of the significant competition for this contract, the Company has experienced a lower profit rate in the Small-Caliber Systems division following the implementation of our new contract. In addition, future levels of government spending cannot be predicted with certainty and thus the Company's production under this contract cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe Company is subject to intense competition for U.S. Government contracts and programs and therefore may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe Company encounters competition for most contracts and programs, including in particular, U.S. government contracts. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, and other resources. The Company's ability to compete for these contracts depends to a large extent upon:\n\u2022\nits effectiveness and innovativeness of research and development programs,\n\u2022\nits ability to offer better program performance at a lower cost than the competitors,\n\u2022\nits readiness with respect to facilities, equipment and personnel to undertake the programs for which it competes, and\n\u2022\nits past performance and demonstrated capabilities.\nThe Company is competing with at least three other companies for the next round of contracts for cargo resupply services to the International Space Station, known as the Commercial Resupply Services-2 (\"CRS II\") program. NASA has stated that it intends to award CRS II program contracts to one or more companies for six or more flights per contract. The awarded contracts will cover deliveries through 2020, with the option for NASA to purchase additional launches through 2024. NASA could decide not to award any CRS II program contracts to the Company for a number of reasons, including Orbital's October 2014 Antares launch failure. The failure to receive a contract award under the CRS II program could have a material adverse affect on the Company's revenues, profit and cash flows. Even if the Company is awarded a contract under the CRS II program, competitors may submit bid protests challenging the award on the basis of the Antares launch failure or other factors, which may result in NASA taking corrective action and making an award to another competitor. Any such bid protest may require the Company to expend considerable funds to defend the award and could delay the commencement of the CRS II program and any payments to the Company thereunder.\nIn some instances, the U.S. Government directs a program to a single supplier. In these cases, there may be other suppliers who have the capability to compete for the programs involved, but they can only enter or reenter the market if the U.S. Government chooses to open the particular program to competition and, as such, these types of programs are subject to risk of the U.S. Government providing new awards to other suppliers. The Company's sole-source contracts accounted for 63% of its U.S. Government sales in fiscal 2015.\nThe downsizing of the munitions industrial base has resulted in a reduction in the number of competitors through consolidations and departures from the industry. This has reduced the number of competitors for some contracts and programs, but has strengthened the capabilities of some of the remaining competitors. In addition, it is possible that there will be increasing competition from the remaining competitors in business areas where they do not currently compete, particularly in those business areas dealing with electronics, as a result of budget pressures caused by Congressional appropriations and sequestration.\nThe Company may not be able to react to increases in its costs due to the nature of its U.S. Government contracts.\nThe Company's U.S. Government contracts can be categorized as either \"cost-plus\" or \"fixed-price.\"\nCost-Plus Contracts. Cost-plus contracts are cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, or cost-plus-award-fee contracts. Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts allow the Company to recover its approved costs plus a fixed fee. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts and cost-plus-award-fee contracts allow the Company to recover its approved costs plus a fee that can fluctuate\nbased on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, quality, schedule, and performance. The award or incentive fees that are typically associated with these programs are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise.\nFixed-Price Contracts. Fixed-price contracts are firm-fixed-price, fixed-price-incentive, or fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts. Under firm-fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform certain work for a fixed price and absorb any cost overruns. Fixed-price-incentive contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the final contract price may be adjusted based on total final costs compared to total target cost, and may be affected by schedule and performance. Fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts allow for a fixed price per labor hour, subject to a contract cap. All fixed-price contracts present the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. If the initial estimates used to calculate the contract price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect, there could be a material adverse effect on operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition, some contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule, and performance. If the Company fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts, the cost to perform the work could increase or the Company's price could be reduced, which would adversely affect the Company's financial condition. The U.S. Government also regulates the accounting methods under which costs are allocated to U.S. Government contracts.\nThe following table identifies, by contract-type, the amount contributed to the Company's U.S. Government business in fiscal 2015:\nThe Company uses estimates in accounting for its programs. Changes in estimates could affect the Company's financial results.\nContract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues, including the impact of scope change negotiations, estimating program costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of the Company's contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complex and subject to many variables. Assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, many assumptions are made regarding the future impacts of such things as the business base, efficiency initiatives, cost reduction efforts, contract changes and claim recovery. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Estimates of award and incentive fees are also used in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.\nBecause of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if the Company used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. Additional information on the Company's accounting policies for revenue recognition can be found under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the section titled \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 of this report.\nThe Company's U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination.\nThe Company's direct and indirect contracts with the U.S. Government or its prime contractors may be terminated or suspended at any time, with or without cause, for the convenience of the government or in the event of a default by the contractor. If a cost-plus contract is terminated, the contractor is entitled to reimbursement of its approved costs. If the contractor would have incurred a loss had the entire contract been performed, then no profit is allowed by the U.S. Government.\nIf the termination is for convenience, the contractor is also entitled to receive payment of a total fee proportionate to the percentage of the work completed under the contract. If a fixed-price contract is terminated, the contractor is entitled to receive payment for items delivered to and accepted by the U.S. Government. If the termination is for convenience, the contractor is also entitled to receive fair compensation for work performed plus the costs of settling and paying claims by terminated\nsubcontractors, other settlement expenses, and a reasonable profit on the costs incurred or committed. While the contractor is entitled to these claims under either type of contract, there can be no assurance that these amounts will be recovered.\nIf a contract termination is for default:\n\u2022\nthe contractor is paid an amount agreed upon for completed and partially completed products and services accepted by the U.S. Government,\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Government is not liable for the contractor's costs for unaccepted items, and is entitled to repayment of any advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract, and\n\u2022\nthe contractor may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.\nOther risks associated with U.S. Government contracts may expose the Company to adverse consequences.\nLike all U.S. Government contractors, the Company is subject to possible losses on contracts due to risks associated with uncertain cost factors related to:\n\u2022\nscarce technological skills and components,\n\u2022\nthe frequent need to bid on programs in advance of design completion, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns,\n\u2022\nthe substantial time and effort required for design and development,\n\u2022\ndesign complexity,\n\u2022\nrapid obsolescence, and\n\u2022\nthe potential need for design improvement.\nThe Company is subject to procurement and other related laws and regulations, and non-compliance may expose the Company to adverse consequences.\nThe Company is subject to extensive and complex U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations, along with ongoing U.S. Government audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance, and administration. As a result, U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, various agency Inspectors General and the Department of Justice, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. In addition, these agencies often investigate the Company's launch vehicle failures and other material occurrences relating to our products, including a current investigation of the Orbital 2009 OCO and 2011 Glory launch failures. These agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including procurement integrity laws and the False Claims Act.\nCharging practices relating to labor, research and development, and other costs that may be charged directly or indirectly to U.S. Government contracts are often scrutinized to determine that such costs are allowable under U.S. Government contracts and furthermore that such costs are reasonable. Any costs determined to be unallowable or unreasonable may not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed may be subject to repayment. If the amount of such costs were significant, the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. We expect to recover a significant portion of the Company's research and development expenses through billings under certain of our U.S. Government contracts in accordance with applicable regulations, but such billings could be reversed or rejected by the U.S. Government. Our inability to recover a significant portion of such expenses could materially adversely affect the Company's operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nU.S. Government agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor's compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, accounting and information systems. Adverse findings relating to the Company's systems could result in the U.S. Government customer withholding a percentage of payments and also could impact the Company's ability to win new U.S. Government contracts or exercise contract options.\nResponding to government audits, inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management attention. Also, if an audit or investigation were to uncover improper or illegal activities, the Company could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, the Company could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were to be made against the Company.\nNovation of U.S. Government contracts involves risk.\nWhen U.S. Government contracts are transferred from one contractor to another, such as in connection with the sale of a business, the U.S. Government may require that the parties enter into a novation agreement. A novation agreement generally provides that:\n\u2022\nthe transferring contractor guarantees or otherwise assumes liability for the performance of the acquiring contractor's obligations under the contract,\n\u2022\nthe acquiring contractor assumes all obligations under the contract, and\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Government recognizes the transfer of the contract and related assets.\nIf the U.S. Government elects not to novate a particular contract, the Company may not recognize the full value of that contract over its lifetime.\nDecreases in demand for military and commercial ammunition could adversely affect the Company's financial performance.\nThe Company sells military ammunition to DoD and commercial ammunition to Vista Outdoor Inc. under an ammunition supply agreement. Both the commercial and military markets for ammunition are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that can cause demand to fluctuate. In particular, decreases in the demand for ammunition in either market could result in excess manufacturing capacity and increased overhead as a result, which could have an impact on the Company's operating results. The Company experienced a decrease in demand for commercial ammunition in fiscal 2015 and also has experienced a decline in demand for military ammunition in recent years. Further declines could materially affect the Company's business and results of operations. In addition, manufacturing costs for ammunition could rise as a result of a number of factors, including increases in commodity prices and increases in labor costs at our LCAAP, which could also have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results and profit margin.\nThe Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability or personal injury claims and litigation.\nThe Company's products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability or personal injury claims relating to the use of those products. The resolution of such claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, and the Company maintains insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks, which we believe to be adequate. However, the Company's reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products.\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with expansion into new and adjacent commercial markets.\nThe Company's long-term business growth strategy includes further expansion into markets such as commercial aerospace structures. Such efforts involve a number of risks, including increased capital expenditures, market uncertainties, schedule delays, performance risk, extended payment terms, diversion of management attention, additional credit risk associated with new customers, and costs incurred in competing with companies with strong brand names and market positions. An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the Company's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nInternational sales are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nA growing portion of our business is derived from international markets. In fiscal 2015, approximately 19% of the Company's sales were to foreign customers, compared to 12% in the prior year, and the Merger has further increased the percentage of business derived from international markets. The Company also procures certain key components from non-U.S. vendors. The Company's international business may pose greater risks than its business in the United States because in some countries there is increased potential for changes in economic, legal and political environments. The Company's international business is also sensitive to changes in a foreign government's national priorities and budgets. International transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from differing legal systems and customs in other countries. In addition, some international customers require contractors to agree to offset programs that may require in-country purchases or manufacturing or financial support arrangements as a condition to awarding contracts. The contracts may include penalties in the event the Company fails to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. Furthermore, the expansion of the Company's international business may create more difficulties and risks to the Company with respect to the maintenance of an integrated supply chain network. An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the Company's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Foreign sales subject the Company to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, exchange controls, the Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in material adverse consequences to the Company.\nThe Company's products are subject to extensive regulation.\nThe Company is required to comply with extensive regulation of its products, including those rules and regulations administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS). Compliance with these laws is costly and time consuming. A violation of these laws could result in significant fines and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability.\nSales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices the Company pays for materials and, as a result, the Company's operating margins may be negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of the Company's non-U.S. businesses are translated into U.S. dollars. While the Company monitors its exchange rate exposures and seeks to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, such activities bear a financial cost and are not always available or successful in mitigating such volatility.\nThe Company has a substantial amount of debt, and the cost of servicing that debt could adversely affect the Company's business and hinder the Company's ability to make payments on its debt.\nAs of March 31, 2015, the Company had total debt of $1.6 billion. In addition, the Company had $202.9 million of outstanding but undrawn letters of credit and, taking into account these letters of credit, an additional $497.1 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. Additional information on the Company's debt can be found under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 7 of this report.\nThe Company has demands on its cash resources in addition to interest and principal payments on its debt including, among others, operating expenses. These significant demands on the Company's cash resources could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations,\n\u2022\nrequire the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, and other general corporate purposes,\n\u2022\nlimit the Company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the defense and aerospace industries,\n\u2022\nplace the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financing flexibility,\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants applicable to the Company's indebtedness, among other things, the Company's ability to borrow additional funds,\n\u2022\nincrease the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, and\n\u2022\nresult in a default event upon a failure to comply with financial covenants contained in the Company's senior credit facilities which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Company's ability to pay interest on and repay its long-term debt and to satisfy its other liabilities will depend upon future operating performance and the Company's ability to refinance its debt as it becomes due. The Company's future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by prevailing economic conditions at that time and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control.\nIf the Company is unable to service its indebtedness and fund operating costs, the Company will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying expenditures for capital equipment and/or share repurchases,\n\u2022\nseeking additional debt financing or equity capital,\n\u2022\nforegoing attractive acquisition opportunities,\n\u2022\nselling assets, or\n\u2022\nrestructuring or refinancing debt.\nThere can be no assurance that any such strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nThe level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect the Company's earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company's earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income recorded for employee benefit plans, primarily pension plans and other postretirement plans. Generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America require the Company to calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions made relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in these assumptions. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension and postretirement benefit expense or income for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates, and the health care cost trend rate. The Company is required to remeasure its plan assets and benefit obligations annually, which may result in a significant change to equity through other comprehensive income (loss). The Company's pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense can also be affected by legislation or other regulatory actions. Additional information on how the Company's financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies can be found under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the section titled \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 of this report.\nThe Company's business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security and other industrial, insider and physical security threats, and other disruptions.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, the Company faces cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and terrorist acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures, natural disasters, or public health crises. The Company also faces the risk of economic espionage, which involves the targeting or acquisition of sensitive financial, trade, proprietary or technological information.\nThe Company routinely experiences cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to the Company's sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. The Company may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage.\nPrior cyber-attacks directed at the Company have not had a material impact on the Company's financial results, and we believe that our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are generally adequate. The threats the Company faces vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent threats from highly-organized adversaries who target us because we protect national security information. If the Company is unable to protect sensitive information, its customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures and, as a result, our present and future business could be negatively impacted. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nAlthough the Company works cooperatively with its customers, suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners, and acquired entities to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, the Company must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may in turn affect the security of its own information and that of other parties. The entities we work with have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with government contractors, such as the Company, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats the Company faces.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to customers, loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property, the obsolescence of our products and services, our financial results, our reputation and our stock price.\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact the Company.\nKey raw materials used in the Company's operations include aluminum, steel, steel alloys, copper, zinc, lead, graphite fiber, prepreg, hydroxy terminated polybutadiene, epoxy resins and adhesives, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers, diethylether, x-ray film, plasticizers and nitrate esters, impregnated ablative materials, various natural and synthetic rubber compounds, polybutadiene, acrylonitrile, and ammonium perchlorate. The Company also purchases chemicals; electronic,\nelectro-mechanical and mechanical components; subassemblies; and subsystems that are integrated with the manufactured parts for final assembly into finished products and systems.\nThe Company monitors sources of supply to attempt to assure that adequate raw materials and other supplies needed in manufacturing processes are available. As a U.S. Government contractor, the Company is frequently limited to procuring materials and components from sources of supply approved by the DoD. In addition, as changes occur in business conditions, the DoD budget, and Congressional allocations, suppliers of specialty chemicals and materials sometimes consider dropping low volume items from their product lines, which may require, as it has in the past, qualification of new suppliers for raw materials on key programs. The supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in the Company's operations, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry. This single source, however, maintains two separate manufacturing lines a reasonable distance apart, which mitigates the likelihood of a fire, explosion, or other problem impacting all production. The Company may also rely on one primary supplier for other production materials. Although other suppliers of the same materials may exist, the addition of a new supplier may require the Company to qualify the new source for use. The qualification process may impact the Company's profitability or ability to meet contract deliveries.\nWe also rely on sole source suppliers for a number of key components, including the rocket motors and engines we use on our launch vehicles. If we are unable to obtain such components in the future, due to a supplier's financial difficulties or a supplier's failure to perform as expected, we could have difficulty procuring such components in a timely or cost effective manner. A disruption in the procurement of key components could result in substantial cost increases to the Company, significant delays in the execution of certain contracts or our inability to complete certain contracts, any of which could result in a materially adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\nFor example, as a result of the failure of Orbital's Antares launch vehicle in October 2014 and prior engine test failures, we have experienced additional costs, and we have ceased using the AJ-26 rocket engine in our Antares product line. In addition, the Company's recovery plan involves a third-party launch vehicle as well as a new engine for the Company's own launch vehicle, and the time, expense and effort associated with our recovery plan have resulted in additional costs and delays.\nCertain suppliers of materials used in the manufacturing of rocket motors have discontinued the production of some materials. These materials include certain insulation and resin materials for rocket motor cases and aerospace-grade rayon for nozzles. The Company has qualified new replacement materials for some programs. For other programs, the Company or the Company's customer has procured sufficient inventory to cover current program requirements and is in the process of qualifying new replacement materials to be qualified in time to meet future production needs. The Company's profitability may be affected if unforeseen difficulties in developing and qualifying replacement materials occur.\nThe Company is also impacted by increases in the prices of raw materials used in production on commercial and fixed-price business. The Company has seen a significant fluctuation in the prices of commodity metals, including copper, lead, steel and zinc. The fluctuating costs of natural gas and electricity also have an impact on the cost of operating the Company's factories.\nProlonged disruptions in the supply of any of the Company's key raw materials or components, difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials, components or new sources of supply, or a continuing increase in the prices of raw materials, energy or components could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals may force the Company to incur additional expenses.\nThe SEC has adopted disclosure rules applicable when certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjacent countries, referred to as \"conflict minerals,\" are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company such as the Company. These conflict minerals are tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. Implementation of the new disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals that the Company uses in the manufacture of its products. The Company's supply chain is complex, and the Company may not be able to conclusively verify whether conflict minerals are used in its products or whether its products are \"conflict free.\" The Company could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.\nFailure of the Company's subcontractors to perform their contractual obligations could materially and adversely impact the Company's prime contract performance and ability to obtain future business.\nThe Company relies on subcontracts with other companies to perform a portion of the services the Company provides its customers on many of its contracts. There is a risk that the Company may have disputes with its subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, the Company's failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, or the Company's hiring of\npersonnel of a subcontractor. A failure by one or more of the Company's subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to perform its obligations as the prime contractor. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer limiting payments or terminating a contract for default. A default termination could expose the Company to liability and have a material adverse effect on the ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nFailure to successfully negotiate or renew collective bargaining agreements, or strikes, slow-downs or other labor-related disruptions, could adversely affect the Company's operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance.\nA number of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which expire on various dates. In addition, the Company is currently negotiating an initial collective bargaining agreement with employees at one of its major locations. Strikes, slow-downs or other labor-related disruptions could occur if the Company is unable to either negotiate or renew these agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operating results. The terms and conditions of new or renegotiated agreements could also increase the Company's costs or otherwise affect its ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance its efficiency.\nThe Company's future success and growth will depend significantly on its ability to develop new technologies and products that achieve market acceptance within acceptable margins while maintaining a qualified workforce to meet the needs of its customers.\nVirtually all of the products produced and sold by the Company are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system integration techniques and capabilities. The Company's commercial and government businesses both operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, industry standards, market trends and customer demands. The product and program needs of the Company's government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, the Company's future performance depends on its ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices.\nOur ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.\nIn addition, because of the highly specialized nature of its business, the Company must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by its customers. The Company's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows may be adversely affected if it is unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company's products will be successfully developed or manufactured or that they will perform as intended.\nMost of the products the Company develops and manufactures are technologically advanced and sometimes include novel systems that must function under highly demanding operating conditions. From time to time, the Company experiences product failures, cost overruns in developing and manufacturing its products, delays in delivery and other operational problems. The Company has experienced product and service failures, schedule delays and other problems in connection with certain of its launch vehicles, including the Antares launch vehicle, satellites, advanced space systems and other products. The Company may have similar occurrences in the future. Some of the Company's satellite and launch services contracts impose monetary penalties on the Company for delays and for performance failures, which penalties could be significant. In addition to any costs resulting from product warranties or required remedial action, product failures or significant delays may result in increased costs or loss of revenues due to the postponement or cancellation of subsequently scheduled operations or product deliveries and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Negative publicity from a product failure could damage the Company's reputation and impair its ability to win new contracts.\nDue to the volatile and flammable nature of its products, fires or explosions may disrupt the Company's business.\nMany of the Company's products involve the manufacture and/or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials. From time to time, these activities have resulted in incidents which have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted some manufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities. The Company has safety and loss prevention programs which require detailed pre-construction reviews of process\nchanges and new operations, along with routine safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies. However, the Company cannot ensure that it will not experience similar incidents in the future or that any similar incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern both past practices and current compliance which may expose the Company to adverse consequences.\nThe Company's operations and ownership or use of real property are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and regulations, including those for discharge of hazardous materials, remediation of contaminated sites, and restoration of damage to the environment. At certain sites that the Company owns or operates or formerly owned or operated, there is known or potential contamination that the Company is required to investigate, remediate, or provide resource restoration. The Company could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs, resource restoration costs, fines, and penalties, or third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of liabilities associated with past practices or violations of environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits.\nThe Company expects that a portion of its environmental compliance and remediation costs will be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts. Some of the remediation costs that are not recoverable from the U.S. Government that are associated with facilities purchased in a business acquisition may be covered by various indemnification agreements.\nWhile the Company has environmental management programs in place to mitigate risks, environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows in the past, and it is difficult to predict whether they will have a material impact in the future.\nCapital market volatility could adversely impact the Company's earnings because of the Company's capital structure.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates. If interest rates increase, the Company may incur increased interest expense on variable interest-rate debt or short-term borrowings, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company may pursue or complete acquisitions, or other strategic transactions, which represent additional risk and could impact future financial results.\nThe Company's business strategy includes the potential for future acquisitions or other similar strategic transactions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks including negotiating an appropriate price, successfully integrating the acquired company with the Company's operations, and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies related to the acquired company. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any future acquisitions or other transactions will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact the Company's operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. Furthermore, the Company may engage in other strategic business transactions. Such transactions could cause unanticipated costs and difficulties, may not achieve intended results, and may require significant time and attention from management which could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nThe Company's profitability could be impacted by unanticipated changes in its tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nThe Company's business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting income tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in income tax expense.\nThe Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.\nThe Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some involving substantial amounts) that arise out of the conduct of the Company's business including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters, and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the Company's business may be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of these matters that cannot be predicted with certainty.\nMoreover, the Company's potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy, or the impact of evidentiary issues, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Additional information can be found in Item 3 of this report.\nThe integration of the Company's aerospace and defense businesses with Orbital may continue to present significant challenges.\nThere continues to be a significant degree of effort and management attention devoted to the process of integrating the Company's aerospace and defense businesses with Orbital following the Merger. The difficulties and challenges of this integration include:\n\u2022\nintegrating the two entities and carrying on their ongoing operations,\n\u2022\ncoordinating a variety of geographically separate business locations,\n\u2022\nintegrating the business cultures of the two entities, and\n\u2022\nretaining key officers and personnel.\nThe continuing process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the Company's activities. Members of the Company\u2019s senior management team may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which decreases the time they have to manage the Company, service customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the Company's business could suffer. Furthermore, the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nThe Company may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger depends, in part, on the ability of the Company to realize anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies. The Company\u2019s success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the Company's business and operations. Even if the Company integrates its businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that the Company expects from this integration within the anticipated time frame or at all. The Company may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs, or the benefits from the Merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. In addition, integration expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of the Company or Vista Outdoor, then the Company or its stockholders immediately prior to the Distribution may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nThe Distribution and the Merger are intended to qualify as tax-free to the Company, the stockholders of the Company, Vista Outdoor and Orbital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts will agree with the conclusion of the parties and their counsel regarding the tax treatment of the Distribution and Merger. If the Distribution or certain related transactions were taxable, the Company's stockholders would recognize income on their receipt of Vista Outdoor stock in the Distribution, and the Company would be considered to have made a taxable sale of certain of its assets to Vista Outdoor.\nThe Distribution will be taxable to the Company pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or more change in ownership of either the Company or Vista Outdoor, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. Because the Company's stockholders collectively owned more than 50% of the Company's common stock following the Merger, the Merger alone will not cause the Distribution to be taxable to the Company under Section 355(e). However, Section 355(e) could apply if other acquisitions of stock of the Company before or after the Merger, or of Vista Outdoor after the Merger, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. If Section 355(e) was to apply, the Company would be considered to have made a taxable sale of certain assets to Vista Outdoor and could recognize a substantial taxable gain.\nUnder the tax matters agreement between the Company and Vista Outdoor (the \"Tax Matters Agreement\"), in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, Vista Outdoor is required to indemnify the Company against taxes on the Distribution that arise as a result of actions or failures to act by Vista Outdoor, or as a result of Section 355(e) applying due to acquisitions of Vista Outdoor stock after the Distribution. In other cases, however, the Company might recognize taxable gain\non the Distribution without being entitled to an indemnification payment under the Tax Matters Agreement. If such tax is imposed on Vista Outdoor, then the Company generally will be required to indemnify Vista Outdoor for that tax. The possibility of the Company recognizing and not being indemnified for this gain may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring stock of the Company during the two years after the Merger in a transaction that stockholders of the Company might consider favorable.\nThe Company may be unable to take certain actions after the Merger because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Distribution or the Merger, and such restrictions could be significant.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement between the Company and Vista Outdoor, the Company is prohibited from taking actions or omissions that could reasonably be expected to cause the Distribution to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the opinions of counsel received by the Company or Orbital in connection with the Merger.\nIn particular, for two years after the Distribution, the Company may not:\n\u2022\nenter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement or engage in any substantial negotiations with respect to any transaction involving the acquisition, issuance, repurchase or change of ownership of any of the Company\u2019s capital stock, together with options or other rights in respect of that capital stock, subject to certain limited exceptions;\n\u2022\ncease to be engaged in the active conduct of, or sell or transfer more than 30% of the gross assets or gross consolidated assets of, certain businesses;\n\u2022\nredeem or otherwise repurchase its capital stock, subject to certain limited exceptions; or\n\u2022\nliquidate, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise.\nBecause of these restrictions, for two years after the Merger, the Company is limited in the amount of capital stock it can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital or in the amount of stock that it can repurchase from investors.", "PERMNO": 76477, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "OA"}
