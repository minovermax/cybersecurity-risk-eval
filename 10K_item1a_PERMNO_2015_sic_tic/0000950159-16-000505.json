{"cik": "945989", "company": "ASTEA INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following discussion of the Company's risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this report and presented by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHistory of Net Losses\nThe Company has a history of net losses. In 2015, the Company generated a net loss of $4.4 million compared to a net loss of $3.4 million in 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $35.8 million. Moreover, the Company expects to continue to incur additional operating expenses for research and development and investment in software development costs to achieve its projected revenue growth. There is no assurance that the Company may be able to achieve the necessary revenue growth or profitability in the future. If the Company does not attain or sustain profitability or raise additional equity or debt in the future, the Company may be unable to continue its operations.\nNeed for Development of New Products\nThe Company's future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments, industry standards and the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers, including developments within the client/server, thin-client and object-oriented computing environments. Such developments may require, from time to time, substantial capital investments by the Company in product development and testing. The Company intends to continue its commitment to research and development and its efforts to develop new products and product enhancements. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and product enhancements; that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance; or that the Company's current or future products will conform to industry requirements. Furthermore, reallocation of resources by the Company, such as the diversion of research and development personnel to development of a particular feature for a potential or existing customer, can delay new products and certain product enhancements. Some of our customers adopted our software on an incremental basis. These customers may not expand usage of our software on an enterprise-wide basis or implement new software products introduced by the Company. The failure of the software to perform to customer expectations or otherwise to be deployed on an enterprise-wide basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to collect revenues or to increase revenues from new as well as existing customers. If the Company is unable to develop and market new products or enhancements of existing products successfully, the Company's ability to remain competitive in the industry will be materially adversely affected.\nRapid Technological Change\nIn the software industry there is a continual emergence of new technologies and continual change in customer requirements. Because of the rapid pace of technological change in the application software industry, the Company's current market position could be rapidly eroded by product advancements. In order to remain competitive, the Company must introduce new products or product enhancements that meet customers' requirements in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to do this, it may lose current and prospective customers to competitors.\nThe Company's application environment relies primarily on software development tools from Microsoft Corporation. If alternative software development tools were to be designed and generally accepted by the marketplace, we could be at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies employing such alternative developmental tools.\nWhile the Company has licensed Astea Alliance to over 300 companies worldwide from 1998 through 2015, and more than 50 companies for the FieldCentrix suite supported by the Company since September 2005, revenues from sales of both Astea Alliance and FieldCentrix may not be sufficient to support the expenses of the Company. The Company's future success will depend mainly on its ability to increase licensed users of both the Astea Alliance suite and FieldCentrix offerings, on developing new products and product enhancements to complement its existing product offerings, on its ability to continue to generate professional services, support and maintenance revenues to Astea Alliance and FieldCentrix customers and on its ability to control its operating expenses. Any failure of the Company's products to achieve or sustain market acceptance, or of the Company to sustain its current position in the CRM software market due to rapid technological changes, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase demand for Astea Alliance and FieldCentrix products, maintain an acceptable level of support and maintenance revenues or to lower its expenses, thereby avoiding future losses.\nBurdens of Customization\nOn rare occasions, the Company's clients may request significant customization of Astea Alliance and FieldCentrix products to address unique characteristics of their businesses or computing environments. In these situations, the Company would apply contract accounting to determine the recognition of license revenues. The Company's commitment to the customization could place a burden on its client support resources or delay the delivery or installation of products, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect its relationship with significant clients or otherwise adversely affect business and results of operations. In addition, the Company could incur penalties or reductions in revenues for failures to develop or timely deliver new products or product enhancements under development agreements and other arrangements with customers. If customers are not able to customize or deploy the Company's products successfully, the customer may not complete expected product deployment, which would prevent recognition of revenues and collection of amounts due, and could result in claims against the Company.\nProduct Defects; Failure to Meet Performance Criteria\nThe Company's software is intended for use in enterprise-wide applications that may be critical to its customers' business. As a result, customers and potential customers typically demand strict requirements for installation and deployment. The Company's software products are complex and may contain undetected errors or failures, particularly when software must be customized for a particular customer, when first introduced or when new versions are released. Although the Company conducts extensive product testing during product development, the Company has at times delayed commercial release of software until problems were corrected and, in some cases, has provided enhancements to correct errors in released software. The Company could, in the future, lose revenues or incur additional and unexpected costs as a result of software errors or defects. Despite testing by the Company and by current and potential customers, errors in the software, customizations or releases might not be detected until after initiating commercial shipments, which could result in additional costs, delays, possible damage to the Company's reputation and could cause diminished demand for the Company's products. This could lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduce the opportunity to renew maintenance contracts or sell new licenses.\nOur Sales Cycles Can be Long, Unpredictable and Require Considerable Time and Expense, Which May Cause our Operating Results to Fluctuate\nThe timing of our closing sales to customers is difficult to predict. These efforts require us to educate our customers about the use and benefit of our services, including the technical capabilities and potential cost savings to an organization. customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process that has in the past resulted in a lengthy sales cycle, typically between four and twelve months. We spend substantial time, effort and money on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, service subscriptions are frequently subject to budget constraints and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. If sales expected from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our results could fall short of public expectations, and our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected from quarter to quarter.\nContinued Dependence on Large Contracts May Result in Lengthy Sales and Implementation Cycles and Impact Revenue Recognition and Cash Flow\nThe sale and implementation of the Company's products generally involve a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers. As a result, the Company's sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes attendant to significant capital expenditures, definition of special customer implementation requirements, and extensive contract negotiations with the customer. Therefore, the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and typically lasts between four and twelve months. During this time the Company may devote significant time and resources to a prospective customer, including costs associated with multiple site visits, product demonstrations and feasibility studies. The Company may experience a number of significant delays over which the Company has no control. Because the costs associated with the sale of the product are fixed in current periods, there may be a lag between the time the Company incurs costs with regard to a particular customer or contract and the time the Company begins to receive or recognize revenues from such customer or contract. Moreover, in the event of any downturn in any existing or potential customer's business or the economy in general, purchases of the Company's products may be deferred or canceled.\nIn addition, the implementation of the Company's products typically takes several months of integration of the product with the customer's other existing systems and customer training requires a close working relationship between the customer and members of the Company's professional service organization. These issues make it difficult to predict the quarter in which expected orders will occur. Delays in implementation of products could cause some or all of the professional services revenues from those projects to be shifted from the expected quarter to a subsequent quarter or quarters.\nWhen the Company has provided consulting services to implement certain larger projects, some customers have delayed payment of a portion of license fees until implementation was complete and in some cases have disputed the consulting fees charged for implementation. There can be no assurance the Company will not experience additional delays or disputes regarding payment in the future, particularly if the Company receives orders for large, complex installations. Additionally, as a result of the application of the revenue recognition rules applicable to the Company's licenses under generally accepted accounting principles, license revenues may be recognized in periods after those in which the respective licenses were signed. The Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its results of operations should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance.\nWe Cannot Accurately Predict Subscription Renewals Rates and the Impact These Rates May Have on Our Future Revenue and Operating Results\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our cloud service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 36 months. Some customers may elect not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer users or renew for shorter contract lengths. We cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers' spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our subscription services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business may suffer.\nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell new and additional services and/or more subscription service to new and existing customers. The rate at which our customers purchase new licenses or upgraded services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these services. If our efforts to sell to new and existing customers are not successful, our business may suffer.\nFluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results May Be Significant\nThe Company's quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as:\n\u00b7 revenue from software sales;\n\u00b7 timing of new product releases;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the Company's products;\n\u00b7 customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products;\n\u00b7 size and timing of significant orders, the recognition of revenue from such orders;\n\u00b7 changes in pricing policies by the Company and its competitors;\n\u00b7 introduction of alternative technologies;\n\u00b7 changes in operating expenses;\n\u00b7 changes in the Company's strategy;\n\u00b7 personnel changes; and\n\u00b7 effect of potential acquisitions by the Company and its competitors.\nThe Company has limited or no control over many of these factors. Due to all these factors, it is possible that in some future quarter the Company's operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nFluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results Due to Seasonal Factors\nThe Company expects to experience fluctuations in the sale of licenses for its products due to seasonal factors. The Company has experienced and anticipates that it may experience relatively lower sales in the first fiscal quarter due to patterns in capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of current and prospective customers. The Company also expects that sales may decline during the summer months of its third quarter, particularly in the European markets. Moreover, the Company generally records most of its total quarterly license revenues in the third month of the quarter, with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month. This concentration of license revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter. The Company expects these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future. Thus, its results of operations may vary seasonally in accordance with licensing activity, and will also depend upon recognition of revenue from such licenses from time to time. The Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nIf goodwill becomes impaired, it could impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified. Our identifiable intangible assets except for goodwill, were fully amortized as of September 30, 2015. The only intangible asset remaining was goodwill. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill on at least an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets, include the following:\n\u00b7 significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u00b7 significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u00b7 significant negative industry or economic trends;\n\u00b7 significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period;\n\u00b7 changes in our organization or management reporting structure that could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit; and\n\u00b7 a decline in our market capitalization below net book value.\nOn October 1, 2015, we performed our annual impairment test, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to the impairment charge as of December 31, 2015, there is no remaining value of goodwill reported on our balance sheet.\nCompetition in the CRM Software Market is Intense\nThe Company competes in the CRM software market. This market is highly competitive and the Company expects competition in the market to increase. The Company's competitors include large public companies such as Oracle, which owns PeopleSoft and Siebel, as well as traditional ERP software providers such as SAP that are developing CRM capabilities. In addition, a number of smaller privately held companies generally focus only on discrete areas of the CRM software marketplace. Because the barriers to entry in the CRM software market are relatively low, new competitors may emerge with products that are superior to the Company's products or that achieve greater market acceptance. Moreover, the CRM industry is currently experiencing significant consolidation, as larger public companies seek to enter the CRM market through acquisitions or establish other cooperative relationships among themselves, thereby enhancing their ability to compete in this market with their combined resources. Some of the Company's existing and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources than the Company. These and other competitors pose business risks to the Company because:\n\u00b7 they compete for the same customers that the Company tries to attract;\n\u00b7 if the Company loses customers to its competitors, it may be difficult or impossible to win them back;\n\u00b7 lower prices and a smaller market share could limit the Company's revenue generating ability, reduce its gross margins and restrict its ability to become profitable or sustain profitability; and\n\u00b7 competitors may be able to devote greater resources to more quickly respond to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to the development, promotion and sales of their products.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the Company will not adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nPart of our Business is Dependent on Market Demand for, and Acceptance of, the Cloud-based Model for the Use of Software\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive a growing percentage of our revenue from the sale of cloud-based services. As a result, widespread acceptance and use of the cloud-based business model is critical to our future growth and success. Under the perpetual or periodic license model for software procurement, users of the software typically run applications on their hardware. Because companies are generally predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to the concept of accessing the functionality that software provides as a service through a third party. If the market for cloud-based, software solutions ceases to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our services could be negatively affected.\nDependence on Proprietary Technology\nThe Company depends heavily on proprietary technology for its business to succeed. The Company licenses its products to customers under license agreements containing, among other terms, provisions protecting against the unauthorized use, copying and transfer of the licensed program. In addition, the Company relies on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect the Company's proprietary rights in its products and technology. The legal protection is limited, however. Unauthorized parties could copy aspects of the Company's products and obtain and use information that the Company believes is proprietary. Other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other contracts they have made with the Company. Policing unauthorized use of the Company's software is difficult and, while the Company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. There can be no assurance that any of the measures taken by the Company will be adequate to protect its proprietary technology or that its competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company's technologies. If the Company fails to successfully enforce its proprietary technology, its competitive position may be harmed.\nOther software providers could develop similar technology independently, which may infringe on the Company's proprietary rights. The Company may not be able to detect infringement and may lose a competitive position in the market before it does so. In addition, competitors may design around the Company's technology or develop competing technologies. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect the Company's proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Litigation may be necessary to enforce the Company's proprietary rights. Such litigation is time-consuming, has an uncertain outcome and could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources. However, if the Company fails to successfully enforce its proprietary rights, the Company's competitive position may be harmed.\nLimited Number of Data Centers to Deliver our Cloud Services\nWe host our cloud-based software using several third-party data center facilities. We do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to other data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with a transfer of this type.\nAny changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates.\nOur data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, or vandalism or other misconduct, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.\nOur Success Depends on Our Customers' Continued High-Speed Access to the Internet\nBecause our cloud services are designed to work over the Internet, our revenue growth depends on our customers' high-speed access to the Internet, as well as the continued maintenance and development of the Internet infrastructure. The future delivery of our cloud services will depend on third-party Internet service providers to expand high-speed Internet access, to maintain a reliable network with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, and to develop complementary products and services, including high-speed modems, for providing reliable and timely Internet access and services. The success of our business directly depends on the continued accessibility, maintenance and improvement of the Internet as a convenient means of customer interaction, as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information by businesses to their employees. All of these factors are out of our control.\nTo the extent that the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users, frequency of use or bandwidth requirements, the Internet may become congested and be unable to support the demands placed on it, and its performance or reliability may decline. Any future Internet outages or delays could adversely affect our ability to provide cloud services to our customers.\nPossible Infringement of Third Party Intellectual Property Rights\nSubstantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights are common in this industry. The Company is not aware that its products and technologies employ technology that infringes any valid, existing proprietary rights of third parties. While there currently are no pending lawsuits against the Company regarding infringement of any existing patents or other intellectual property rights or any notices that it is infringing the intellectual property rights of others, third parties may assert such claims in the future. Any claims, with or without merit, could:\n\u00b7\nbe time consuming to defend;\n\u00b7\nresult in costly litigation or damage awards;\n\u00b7\ndivert management's attention and resources;\n\u00b7\ncause product shipment delays; or\n\u00b7\nrequire the Company to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\nA successful claim of intellectual property infringement against the Company or the Company's failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could seriously harm its business because the Company would not be able to sell the impacted product without exposing itself to litigation risk and damages. Furthermore, redevelopment of the product so as to avoid infringement could cause the Company to incur significant additional expense and delay.\nDependence on Technology from Third Parties\nThe Company integrates various third-party software products as components of its software. The Company's business would be disrupted if this software, or functional equivalents of this software, were either no longer available to the Company or the Company was no longer able to gain access to this software on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, the Company would be required to either redesign its software to function with alternate third-party software or develop these components itself, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in software shipments. Furthermore, the Company might be forced to limit the features available in its current or future software offerings.\nSecurity Breaches and Other Disruptions Could Compromise our Information and Expose us to Liability, Which Would Cause our Business and Reputation to Suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of the Company's business, it collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information of the Company and the Company's customers, suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information of the Company's customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company's operations and business strategy. Despite the Company's security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise the Company's networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt the Company's operations and the services the Company provides to customers, damage the Company's reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in the Company's products and services, which could adversely affect the Company's business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nNeed to Expand Indirect Sales\nThe Company has historically sold its products through its direct sales force and a limited number of distributors (value-added resellers, system integrators and sales agents). The Company's ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on its success in establishing relationships with distributors and OEM partners. The Company is currently investing, and plans to continue to invest, significant resources to expand its domestic and international direct sales force and develop distribution relationships. The Company's distributors also sell or can potentially sell products offered by the Company's competitors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of its existing or future third party distribution partners or that such partners will recommend, or continue to recommend, the Company's products. The inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors and OEM partners or to train its direct sales force could cause its sales to decline.\nFuture Acquisitions\nAs part of Astea's growth strategy, it may pursue the acquisition of businesses, technologies or products that are complementary to its business. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks that could harm the Company's business, including the diversion of management's attention, the integration of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, and the potential loss of key employees. In particular, the failure to maintain adequate operating and financial control systems or unexpected difficulties encountered during expansion could harm the Company's business. Acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nUnder the covenants with Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\") regarding our line of credit, the Company must first get SVB's approval before entering into any acquisition transactions.\nExpansion of International Sales\nAstea's international sales accounted for 35% of the Company's revenues in 2015 and 38% in 2014. The Company expects that international sales will continue to be a significant component of its business. In the Company's efforts to expand its international presence, it will face certain risks, which it may not be successful in addressing. These risks include:\n\u00b7 difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels and in translating products into foreign languages;\n\u00b7 difficulties finding staff to manage foreign operations and collect accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 difficulties enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 liabilities and financial exposure under foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 potential political, economic or military instability in the countries in which the Company operates;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates; and\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences.\nAdditionally, the current economic difficulties in several European and Asian countries could have an adverse impact on the Company's international operations in future periods. Any of these factors, if not successfully addressed, could harm the Company's operating results.\nSubjection to Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws\nWe are required to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). The FCPA generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on covered entities which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \"off-books\" slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. Although we believe that we have acted in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws, there is no assurance that our practices have prevented or will work to prevent anti-corruption violations or that they will protect us against liability under anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our integrators, distributors, agents and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire.\nCompliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. If we or our intermediaries acting on our behalf are found to have failed to comply with the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any investigation of any potential violations of anti-corruption laws also could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, such as through legal expenses and reputational effects.\nResearch and Development in Israel; Potential Political, Economic or Military Instability\nAstea's principal research and development facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect its business. Continued political and economic instability or armed conflicts in Israel or in the region could directly harm the Company's business and operations.\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility has existed in varying degrees and intensity. This state of hostility has led to security and economic problems for Israel. The future of peace efforts between Israel and its Arab neighbors, particularly in light of the recent violence and political unrest in the Middle East, remains uncertain and several countries still restrict business with Israel and Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may also materially harm the Company's operating results and financial condition. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations. As an example, in early 2011, riots and uprisings in several countries in the Middle East have led to severe political instability and to a decline in the regional security situation. Such instability may affect the global economy and marketplace and could adversely affect business conditions and therefore affect the Company's operations. The political and security situation in Israel may also result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.\nDependence on Key Personnel Who Are Required to Perform Military Service\nMany of the Company's employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty in the Israeli army and are subject to being called to active duty at any time, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to pursue its planned research and development efforts. The Company cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on its workforce or business and the Company cannot predict the effect of any expansion or reduction of these obligations. However, in light of the recent violence and political unrest in Israel, there is an increased risk that a number of the Company's employees could be called to active military duty without prior notice. The Company's operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of time of one or more of our key employees or a significant number of other employees due to military service. Any such disruption in the Company's business could harm its operations.\nInflation and Currency Fluctuations\nThe Company generates most of its revenues in U.S. dollars but all of its costs associated with the foreign operations located in Europe, the Pacific Rim, Japan, and Israel are denominated in the respective local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation and reporting. As a result, the Company is exposed to risks to the extent that the rate of inflation in Europe, the Pacific Rim, Japan, or Israel exceeds the rate of devaluation of their related foreign currency in relation to the U.S. dollar or if the timing of such devaluations lags behind inflation in Europe, the Pacific Rim, Japan, or Israel. In that event, the cost of the Company's operations in Europe, the Pacific Rim, Japan, and Israel measured in terms of U.S. dollars will increase and the U.S. dollar-measured results of operations will suffer. Historically, Israel has experienced periods of high inflation.\nDependence on Key Personnel; Competition for Employees\nThe continued growth and success largely depends on the managerial and technical skills of key technical, sales and management personnel. In particular, the Company's business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of Zack Bergreen, the founder and chief executive officer. If Mr. Bergreen were to leave or become unable to perform services for the Company, the business would likely be harmed. The Company's success also depends, to a substantial degree, upon its continuing ability to attract, motivate and retain other talented and highly qualified personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, particularly so in recent years. From time to time the Company has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining talented and qualified employees. There can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key technical, sales and managerial employees or that it can attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future. If the Company fails to attract or retain enough skilled personnel, its product development efforts may be delayed, the quality of its customer service may decline and sales may decline.\nConcentration of Ownership\nCurrently, Zack Bergreen, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owns approximately 54.5% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company, which includes 826,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 797,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result, Mr. Bergreen exercises significant control over the Company through his ability to influence and control the election of directors and all other matters that require action by the Company's stockholders. Under certain circumstances, Mr. Bergreen could prevent or delay a change of control of the Company which may be favored by a significant portion of the Company's other stockholders, or cause a change of control not favored by the majority of the Company's other stockholders. Mr. Bergreen's ability under certain circumstances to influence, cause or delay a change in control of the Company also may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company's Common Stock.\nPossible Volatility of Stock Price\nThe market price of the Common Stock has in the past been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations in response to, and may be adversely affected by, variations in quarterly operating results, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, developments in the software industry, and adverse earnings or other financial announcements of the Company's customers as well as other factors. In addition, the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time, which may bear no meaningful relationship to the Company's performance. Broad market fluctuations, as well as economic conditions generally and in the software industry specifically, may result in material adverse effects on the market price of the Company's Common Stock.\nUnder Our Loan Agreement with SVB, if We Fail to Meet Certain Earnings Covenants, SVB May Increase Our Interest Rate, Lower Our Borrowing Base or Refuse to Grant Us Any Additional Borrowings in the Future.\nThe Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended (the \"Loan Agreement\") with SVB. The Loan Agreement established a revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Facility\") for the Company in the principal amount of up to $2,000,000.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Loan Agreement contains covenants prohibiting the Company from, among other things: (a) conveying, selling, leasing, transferring or otherwise disposing of their properties or assets; (b) liquidating or dissolving; (c) engaging in any business other than the business currently engaged in or reasonably related thereto; (d) entering into any merger or consolidation, or acquiring all or substantially all of the capital stock or property of another entity; (e) becoming liable for any indebtedness; (f) allowing any lien or encumbrance on any of their property; and (g) paying any dividends (other than dividends on outstanding convertible preferred stock); and (i) making payment on subordinated debt. Further, the Company must maintain a minimum \"adjusted quick ratio,\" tested as of the last day of each month, of at least 1.25:1.00. The adjusted quick ratio is the ratio of (a) the Company's consolidated, unrestricted cash plus net booked accounts receivable to (b) the Company's' liabilities to SVB plus, without duplication, the aggregate amount of the Company's' liabilities that mature within 1 year, minus the current portion of deferred revenue.\nThe Revolving Facility is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company, excluding the intellectual property of the Company. The Loan Agreement contains a negative covenant prohibiting the Company from granting a security interest in its intellectual property to any party.\nHowever, there is no assurance that in the future that SVB will agree to grant a waiver or enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company if it fails to be in compliance with its covenants. Continued compliance with its covenants is dependent on the Company achieving certain operating results in 2016 and throughout the remaining term of the loan agreement. Market conditions have been difficult to predict and there is no assurance that in future periods the Company will meet the operating income targets in order to meet certain operating covenants as currently defined in the amended loan agreement.\nLimitations of the Company Charter Documents\nThe Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could discourage a proxy contest or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the Company's Common Stock, including provisions that allow the Board of Directors to take into account a number of non-economic factors, such as the social, legal and other effects upon employees, suppliers, customers and creditors, when evaluating offers for the Company's acquisition. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's shares of Common Stock. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with voting, conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to the Company's Common Stock and that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of our holders of Common Stock. There are currently 826,000 Series A and 797,000 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shares outstanding. The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal.", "PERMNO": 81850, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ATEA"}
