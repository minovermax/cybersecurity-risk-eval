{"cik": "828146", "company": "INTERLINK ELECTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe have derived, and expect to continue to derive, a significant amount of revenue from a small number of customers.\nHistorically, we have earned, and believe that in the future we will continue to earn, a substantial portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers. In 2021, our top three customers accounted for 17.0%, 14.7% and 14.7% of our net revenues, respectively. If we were to either lose one of our major customers or have a major customer significantly reduce its volume of business with us, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed unless we are able to replace such demand with other orders promptly. We expect to continue to be dependent on our major customers, the number and identity of which may change from period to period. Because our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, our customers, including our largest customers upon whom we may become dependent, can reduce or terminate altogether their business with us at any time.\nWe rely on third parties for the materials that we use to manufacture our products and a shortage of supply could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and customer relationships.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the raw material components of our products. There are no assurances that our suppliers will be able to maintain an adequate supply of these raw materials to enable us to fulfill all of our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis. A failure to obtain an adequate supply of the materials for our products could increase our costs, cause us to fail to meet delivery commitments and cause our customers to purchase from our competitors, which could adversely affect our operating results and customer relationships. In some situations, we rely on a single supplier for raw material components of our products. Any disruption in these supplier relationships could prevent us from maintaining an adequate supply of materials and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position.\nAdditionally, our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding the outbreak of viruses, widespread illness, infectious diseases, contagions and the occurrence of unforeseen epidemics (including the outbreak of the coronavirus and its potential impact on our financial results) in countries in which our products are manufactured. Moreover, negative press or reports about internationally manufactured products may sway public opinion, and thus customer confidence, away from our products. Furthermore, changes in U.S. trade policies, including new restrictions, tariffs or other changes could lead to additional costs, delays in shipments, embargos and other uncertainties that could negatively impact our relationships with our international suppliers and materially adversely affect our business. We experienced delays in the receipt of certain goods and the supply of our products from international and domestic shipping origins as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more general global supply chain constraints in fiscal 2021. Depending on the continued extent and duration of these constraints and disruptions, our supply chain, results of operations (including sales) or future business may be materially and adversely impacted. These and other issues affecting our international suppliers or internationally manufactured merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in our manufacturing facilities or arrangements could cause our revenues and operating results to decline.\nWe currently manufacture the majority of our products in Shenzhen, China. This facility is vulnerable to damage from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss and similar events. It could also be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Our insurance may not cover such events and, if the event is covered, our insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for any losses that may occur. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at our manufacturing facility could result in delayed shipment of products, missed delivery deadlines and harm to our reputation, which may\ncause our revenues and operating results to decline. Performance, reliability or quality problems with our products may cause our customers to reduce or cancel orders which would harm our operating results.\nWe regularly introduce new products with new technologies or manufacturing processes. Our products have in the past contained, and may in the future contain, errors or defects that may be detected at any point in the life of the product. Detection of such errors could result in delays in shipping and sales during the period required to correct such errors.\nDefects may also result in product returns, loss of sales and cancelled orders, delays in market acceptance, injury to our reputation, injury to customer relationships and increased warranty costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to natural or man-made disasters, inclement weather conditions, accidents, system failures, power outages, political instability (for example, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine), physical or cyber break-ins, server failure, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by employees, acts of terrorism, the outbreak of viruses, widespread illness, infectious diseases, contagions and the occurrence of unforeseen epidemics (including the outbreak of the coronavirus and its potential impact on our financial results) and other unforeseen or catastrophic events, could damage our manufacturing facilities or our vendors\u2019 fulfillment centers or render them inoperable, making it difficult or impossible for us or our vendors to process customer orders for an extended period of time. For example, in March 2022, China imposed a multi-day lockdown in the city of Shenzhen due to a rise in the number of coronavirus cases, which required factories to close and disrupted our manufacturing operations in that city. The war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting political uncertainty also could result in an increase in cyberattacks that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Such events may also result in delays in our or our vendors\u2019 receipt of inventory and the delivery of merchandise between our customers, our stores and/or our partners and our distribution center and our vendors\u2019 fulfillment centers. We or our vendors could also incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing inventory during the time it takes for us or our vendors to reopen or replace our distribution center or any of their fulfillment centers.\nWe cannot guarantee that our HMI solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets.\nOur HMI solutions may not be successful in new markets despite the fact that these product solutions are capable of enabling people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of electronic devices. Various target markets for our interface solutions may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products.\nOur ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following:\n\u25cf the development and growth of these markets\u037e\n\u25cf the ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the needs of these markets;\n\u25cf the price and performance requirements of our customers and the preferences of end users\u037e and\n\u25cf our ability to provide our customers with HMI solutions that provide advantages in terms of size, power consumption, reliability, durability, performance, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions.\nThe failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or if our customers\u2019 products which utilize our HMI solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline.\nWe generally do not sell products to end-users. Instead, we sell component products that our customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on our customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our component products and to generate consumer demand through their marketing and promotional activities. We do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our HMI solutions. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our customers\u2019 products that incorporate our HMI solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers\u2019 price and performance goals, our sales would decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our HMI solutions.\nOur customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay at any time. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative HMI solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe on the intellectual property of others, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe consider our intellectual property to be a key element of our ability to compete in our chosen markets. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and proprietary software to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. There is no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. We also cannot assure that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted will provide proprietary protection. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the final outcome of the litigation.\nDespite our efforts to maintain and safeguard our proprietary rights, there are no assurances that we will be successful in doing so or that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. If any of the holders of these patents assert claims that we are infringing them, we could be forced to incur substantial litigation expenses, and if we were found to be infringing on someone else\u2019s patent, we could be required to pay substantial damages, pay royalties in the future or be enjoined from infringing in the future.\nOur success depends in part on our CEO and CFO, who simultaneously lead other public corporations.\nSteven N. Bronson, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ryan J. Hoffman, our Chief Financial Officer, simultaneously serve as officers and, in the case of Mr. Bronson, a director, of Qualstar Corporation (OTCMKTS: QBAK) and BKF Capital Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS: BKFG). Mr. Bronson serves as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a director of Qualstar Corporation and as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer for BKF Capital Group, Inc., and Mr. Hoffman serves as Chief Financial Officer of each of Qualstar Corporation and BKF Capital Group, Inc.\nAs a result, each of Messrs. Bronson and Hoffman divides his time among these companies and does not devote his full business time and attention to Interlink\u2019s business. Each of Messrs. Bronson and Hoffman currently works an equivalent full-time schedule for Interlink; however, there can be no assurance that the amount of time these officers devote to our company will not diminish from time to time for limited or extended periods as their other business obligations require a greater portion of their attention. Neither Mr. Bronson nor Mr. Hoffman is required to spend a minimum amount of time on Interlink business. Our continued success depends in part upon the availability and performance of these officers, particularly Mr. Bronson, who possesses unique and extensive industry knowledge and experience as well as a deep understanding of our business and strategy. A reduction in their services to Interlink from current levels due to obligations to Qualstar Corporation, BKF Capital Group, Inc. or other organizations with which these officers are affiliated could have a disruptive effect, adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nIf we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological change and gain market acceptance of new products, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nTechnology, both in our markets and in our customers\u2019 markets, is undergoing rapid change. In order to maintain our leadership position in our existing markets and to emerge as a leader in new markets, we will have to maintain a leadership position in the technologies supporting those markets. Doing so will require, among other things, that we accomplish the following:\n\u25cf accurately predict the evolving needs of our customers and develop, in a timely manner, the technology required to support those needs;\n\u25cf provide products that are not only technologically sophisticated and well supported but are also available at a price within market tolerances and competitive with comparable products;\n\u25cf establish and effectively defend our ownership on the intellectual property supporting our products; and\n\u25cf enter into relationships with other companies that have developed complementary technology on which our products also depend.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to achieve any of these objectives.\nOur markets are intensely competitive and many of our potential competitors have resources that we lack.\nOur markets are competitive, and we expect competition in our newer markets to increase. Our competitors include companies with similar products or technologies, companies that sell complementary products to our target markets and our customers themselves, who could choose to manufacture products that they currently buy from us. Our competitors and potential competitors may have established business relationships that afford them a competitive advantage or may create technologies that are superior to ours or that set a new industry standard that will define the successful product for that market. If any of our competitors establish a close working relationship with our customers, they may obtain advance knowledge of our customers\u2019 technology choices or may be afforded an opportunity to work in partnership to develop compatible technologies and may therefore achieve a competitive advantage. We may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches or cyber-attacks.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches or cyber-attacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. The war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting political uncertainty could result in an increase in cyberattacks that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following:\n\u25cf expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber-attack;\n\u25cf liability for stolen assets or information;\n\u25cf costs of repairing damage to our systems;\n\u25cf lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack;\n\u25cf loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack;\n\u25cf increased costs of cyber security protection;\n\u25cf costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; and\n\u25cf damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyber-attack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Stock\nThere is a limited or no public market for our securities.\nOur common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market, where the daily trading volume has been limited. This is due in part to the significant percentage (approximately 83% as of December 31, 2021) of our shares that are held by officers and directors and their affiliates.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that market might become. The lack of an active market may reduce the value of shares of our common stock and impair the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares at the time or price at which they wish to sell them. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our common stock and may impair our ability to acquire or invest in other companies, products, or technologies by using our common stock as consideration.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of a stockholder\u2019s investment could decline.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u25cf announcements of new offerings, products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u25cf significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u25cf litigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and trends;\n\u25cf major catastrophic events;\n\u25cf lockup releases, sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u25cf the impact of outbreaks, and threat or perceived threat of outbreaks, of epidemics and pandemics, including, without limitation, the coronavirus outbreak, on our sourcing and manufacturing operations as well as consumer spending;\n\u25cf departures of key employees; or\n\u25cf an adverse impact on the company from any of the other risks cited herein.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market, in general, experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe liquidation preference of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would reduce the amount available to our common stockholders in the event of our liquidation or winding up.\nHolders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have a liquidation preference equal to the greater of $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, and such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock been converted into our common stock in the event of our liquidation or winding up. This means that those holders are entitled to receive the liquidation preference before any payment or other distribution of assets to our common stockholders, and the amount of any such payment or other distribution will be reduced by that amount.\nThe issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is presently convertible into 400,000 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will result in dilution to the interests of other common stockholders.\nCertain provisions in our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn addition to cash flows generated from operations, we may need to raise capital in the future through the issuance of capital stock. In order to issue any class of capital stock or series of preferred stock the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank on parity with or senior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, we must obtain the affirmative consent of holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If we are unable to obtain the consent of these stockholders in connection with future financings, we would be unable to issue capital stock that is on parity with or senior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which may prevent us from raising additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.\nWe may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through private and public equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholder rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds from third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for our product candidates, or we may need to grant to others the rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock.\nSteven N. Bronson, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 82.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2021. As a result, Mr. Bronson has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, Mr. Bronson has the ability to control the management and affairs of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to control the election of our directors. As a board member and officer, Mr. Bronson owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Bronson may have interests that differ from yours and he may vote in a manner that is adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and, consequently, our common stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, if at all. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock, if any, is subject to the designations, rights and preferences of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, stockholders may only receive a return on their investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nOur charter documents and Nevada law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, by majority vote, or by any shareholder or group of shareholders who own and have the right to vote more than 25% of our issued and\noutstanding securities, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt.\nWe also are subject to provisions of Nevada law found in Nevada Revised Statutes, Sections 78.411 to 78.444, inclusive, that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns 10 percent (10%) or more of our stock, cannot acquire us for a period of time after the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors and stockholders.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur failure to comply with U.S. laws and regulations relating to the export and import of goods, technology, and software could subject us to penalties and other sanctions and restrict our ability to license and develop our circuit designs.\nWe are obligated by law to comply with all U.S. laws and regulations governing the export and import of goods, technology, and services, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), regulations administered by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and regulations administered by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives governing the importation of items on the U.S. Munitions Import List. Pursuant to these regulations, we are responsible for determining the proper licensing jurisdiction and export classification of our products, and obtaining all necessary licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports and imports of technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance or other defense services to or on behalf of foreign persons. We are also required to obtain export licenses, if required, before employing or otherwise utilizing foreign persons in the performance of our contracts if the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software. The violation of any of the applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.\nThese regulations could restrict our ability to sell products and develop new products. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying products incorporating our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of products that include our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or our ability to export or license our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations and decreased revenue. Additionally, failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the U.S. government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges, and debarment from government contracts.\nIf we fail to comply with anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nAs a result of our international operations, we may be subject to anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. If we fail to comply with these laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, or other U.S. or foreign governmental authorities could seek civil and/or criminal sanctions, including monetary fines and penalties against us or our employees, as well as additional changes to our business practices and compliance programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that current environmental laws and product quality specification standards, or any laws or standards enacted in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and various other regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Regulations have been enacted in certain jurisdictions which impose restrictions on waste disposal of electronic products and\nelectronics recycling obligations. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use and disposal of such substances or other environmental or recycling legislation, we could be subject to significant liability or loss of future sales.\nGeneral Risks\nThe ongoing, global coronavirus pandemic has significantly and adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (which causes the disease now known as COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread rapidly across the world, including in all or most of the countries in which we, our clients, and our suppliers operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown in economic activity, a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services, disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, vary by region, are rapidly changing and difficult to predict, its full impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our near-term ability to successfully execute our strategic objectives, remains similarly uncertain and difficult to predict. Further, the pandemic\u2019s ultimate impact depends in part on many factors not within our control and which may vary by region (heightening the uncertainty as to the ultimate impact COVID-19 may have on our operations and financial performance), including, without limitation: restrictive governmental and business actions that have been and continue to be taken in response (including travel restrictions, work from home requirements, and other workforce limitations); economic stimulus, funding and relief programs and other governmental economic responses; the effectiveness of governmental actions; economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; levels of economic contraction or growth; the impact of the pandemic on health and safety; the pace of recovery if and when the pandemic subsides; and how significantly the number of cases increases as economies begin to open and restrictive governmental and business actions are relaxed.\nFurther, the COVID-19 pandemic has recently subjected our operations and financial performance to several risks, including those discussed below:\n\u25cf Operations-related risks: Our business is facing increased operational challenges including a heightened need to protect employee health and safety, office shutdowns, workplace disruptions, and restrictions on the movement of people, both at our own offices and at those of our clients and suppliers. We have also experienced lower demand and volume for products and services, client requests for engagement deferrals or other contract modifications, and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic that adversely impact our business. While these factors have begun to decline and projected demand for our products has stabilized, there can be no assurance that we will not again experience significant declines in product sales due to COVID-19.\n\u25cf Client-related risks: Our clients have been and will continue to be disrupted by quarantines and restrictions on employees\u2019 ability to work and office closures. Such disruptions have and may continue to restrict our ability to provide products and services to our clients and have also and may continue to reduce demand for our products and services. In addition, COVID-19 has adversely affected the global economy and the economies and financial markets of many countries, which may result in further economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services and impact our operations.\n\u25cf Employee-related risks: We have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our ability to deliver our products and services in a timely manner or meet milestones or customer commitments.\nThe full extent of the effect of the pandemic on us, our customers, our supply chain and our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak or subsequent outbreaks. We may continue to experience the effects of the pandemic even after it has waned, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could continue to be affected. In particular, if COVID-19 continues to spread or re-emerges, particularly in the United States, Singapore and China where our operations are most concentrated, resulting in a prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience, among other things:\n\u25cf Adverse impacts on our operations and financial results caused by government and regulatory measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus, temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers, which could impact our ability to timely meet our customers\u2019 orders or negatively impact our supply chain;\n\u25cf The failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, customers and external business partners, to meet their respective obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties including bankruptcy or default;\n\u25cf Disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations;\n\u25cf Interruptions to the operations of our business if the health of our executives, management personnel and other employees are affected, particularly if a significant number of individuals are impacted;\n\u25cf Any accident, COVID-19 illness, or injury to our employees could result in litigation, manufacturing delays and harm to our reputation, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n\u25cf Changes in prices of products and services may be impacted by worldwide demand and by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and such price increases could materially increase our operating costs and adversely affect our profit margin;\n\u25cf Increased cybersecurity and privacy risks and risks related to the reliability of technology to support remote operations;\n\u25cf Sudden and/or severe declines in the market price of our common stock; and\n\u25cf Costs incurred and revenues lost during and from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic likely will not be recoverable.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operations and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results.\nIf we fail to manage change successfully, our operations could be adversely impacted and our business could be impaired.\nThe ability to operate our business in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process. We expect that responding to changes in our business will place a significant strain on our personnel, management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Our ability to manage change effectively will require us to attract, train, motivate and manage new employees, to reallocate human and other resources to support new undertakings and to restructure our operations to manage a restructured business effectively. If we are unable to respond effectively to change, our operations could be adversely affected and our business could be impaired.\nInternational sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue from international sales represents a substantial portion of our overall sales, and this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. The majority of our manufacturing is currently performed in China. Our international operations involve a number of risks, including with respect to:\n\u25cf import-export license agreements, tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers;\n\u25cf staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf securing credit and funding;\n\u25cf maintaining an effective system of internal controls at our foreign facilities;\n\u25cf collecting foreign receivables;\n\u25cf transfer pricing and other tax uncertainties;\n\u25cf currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u25cf reduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf the impact of outbreaks, and threat or perceived threat of outbreaks, of epidemics and pandemics, including, without limitation, the coronavirus outbreak, on our sourcing and manufacturing operations as well as consumer spending;\n\u25cf political and economic instability, and terrorism; and\n\u25cf transportation risks.\nAny of the above factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe expect to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.\nWe expect to make acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including: difficulties integrating acquired technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we were to lose the services of key personnel, or if we are unable to recruit qualified managers and key personnel in the future.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued availability of our key management and technical personnel. Several of our key management personnel have been with us throughout most of our history and have substantial experience with our business and technology. If one or more of our key management personnel leaves Interlink and we are unable to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our business plan, it may have an adverse impact on our business. Our success will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified professional, technical, production, managerial and marketing personnel, both domestically and internationally.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs a non-accelerated filer, we are required to evaluate and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; however, our independent registered public accounting firm may communicate to us if they are not satisfied with the level\nat which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and will be required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the securities exchange on which our common stock is traded and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight is required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. We may need to hire additional employees to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee.", "PERMNO": 79280, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "LINK"}
