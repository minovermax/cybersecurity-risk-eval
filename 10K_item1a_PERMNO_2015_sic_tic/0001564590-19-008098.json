{"cik": "1468328", "company": "Addus HomeCare Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nAny of the risks described below, and the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and cause the actual outcome of matters to differ materially from our current expectations as reflected in forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may also be materially adversely affected by factors that are not currently known to us, by factors that we currently consider immaterial or by factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under \u201cSpecial Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe could face a variety of risks by expanding into new lines of business.\nIn 2018, we expanded our lines of business to include hospice and home health with the acquisition of Ambercare and we acquired facility staffing operations as part of our Arcadia transaction. Risks of our entry into the hospice and home health segments and adding facility staffing operations to our home care segment include, without limitation, difficulties integrating new businesses with our ongoing operations, potential diversion of management\u2019s time and other resources from our existing personal care business, the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into these new lines of business, and inefficient integration of operational and management systems and controls. In addition, new businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare and other laws and regulations, professional liabilities, workers\u2019 compensation liabilities, and tax liabilities. Although we generally attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisitions in the case of acquisitions structured as asset sales and seek indemnification from sellers or insurance protection, we may nevertheless have material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses. Entry into a new line of business may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk.\nOur hospice operations are subject to annual Medicare caps. If we exceed the caps, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOverall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number (generally corresponding to each of our hospice agencies) are subject to an overall payment cap amount, which is calculated and published by the Medicare fiscal intermediary on an annual basis for each federal fiscal year. If payments received under any of our hospice provider numbers exceed these caps, we may be required to reimburse Medicare such excess amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nReductions in reimbursement and other changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal, state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our consumer caseload, units of service, net service revenues, gross profit and profitability.\nA significant portion of our caseload and net service revenues are derived from government healthcare programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived approximately 59.9% of our net service revenues from state and local governmental agencies, primarily through Medicaid. However, changes in government healthcare programs may decrease the reimbursement we receive or limit access to, or utilization of, our services. As federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase and state governments face budgetary shortfalls, federal and state governments have made, and may continue to make,\nsignificant changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and reimbursement received for services rendered to beneficiaries of such programs. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. CMS began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims in April 2013, and these reductions have been extended through 2027.\nThe Medicaid program, which is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, is often a state\u2019s largest program. Governmental agencies generally condition their agreements upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation. Almost all of the states in which we operate have experienced periodic financial pressures and budgetary shortfalls due to challenging economic conditions and the rising costs of healthcare. Reductions to federal support for state Medicaid or other programs could also result in budgetary shortfalls. As a result, many states have made, are considering or may consider making changes in their Medicaid or other state and local medical and social programs, including enacting legislation designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures.\nChanges that may occur at the federal or state level to address budget deficits or otherwise contain costs include:\n\u2022\nlimiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates;\n\u2022\nredefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of services under those programs;\n\u2022\nincreasing consumer responsibility, including through increased co-payment requirements;\n\u2022\ndecreasing benefits, such as limiting the number of hours of personal care services that will be covered;\n\u2022\nchanging reimbursement methodology and program participation eligibility;\n\u2022\nslowing payments to providers;\n\u2022\nincreasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives or \u201call inclusive\u201d programs;\n\u2022\nshifting beneficiaries to managed care organizations; and\n\u2022\nimplementing demonstration projects and alternative payment models.\nCertain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate. In 2018, we derived approximately 47.5% of our total net service revenues from services provided in Illinois, 13.2% of our total net service revenues in New York and 12.0% of our total net service revenues in New Mexico. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these states, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services or other significant changes in these states may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. Illinois, in particular, operated without a state budget for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Illinois legislature has enacted comprehensive state budgets for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. However, there is no certainty that Illinois will pass budgets in subsequent years.\nThe ACA made significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid policy and funding, among other broad changes across the healthcare industry, promoting a shift toward value-based care, including implementation of alternative payment models. The ACA also resulted in expanded Medicaid eligibility in many states and the establishment of various demonstration projects and Medicaid programs under which states may apply to test new or existing approaches to payment and delivery of Medicaid benefits. CMS has indicated that it will look to states to drive innovation and value through such waivers and has taken steps to update program management, the waiver and state plan amendment approval process, and quality reporting, but the extent and effect of these changes remains uncertain. Future health reform efforts or efforts to repeal or significantly change the ACA will likely impact both federal and state programs.\nIf changes in Medicare, Medicaid or other state and local medical and social programs result in a reduction in available funds for the services we offer or a reduction in the number of beneficiaries eligible for our services or a reduction in the number of hours or amount of services that beneficiaries eligible for our services may receive, then our net service revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted. Our profitability depends principally on the levels of government-mandated payment rates and our ability to manage the cost of providing services. In some cases, commercial insurance companies and other private payors rely on government payment systems to determine payment rates. As a result, changes to government healthcare programs that reduce Medicare, Medicaid or other payments may negatively impact payments from private payors, as well. Any reduction in reimbursements or imposition of copayments that dissuade the use of our services, or any reduction in reimbursement from private payors, could also materially adversely affect our profitability.\nFederal and state regulation may impair our ability to consummate acquisitions or open new agencies.\nFederal laws or regulations may adversely impact our ability to acquire home health agencies or open new start-up home health agencies. For example, a Medicare regulation known as the \u201c36 Month Rule\u201d prohibits buyers of home health agencies from assuming the Medicare billing privileges of the acquired agency if the acquired agency either enrolled in Medicare or underwent a change in\nmajority ownership fewer than 36 months prior to the acquisition, subject to certain exceptions. Instead, the buyer must enroll the acquired home health agencies as new providers with Medicare. The 36 Month Rule can increase competition for acquisition targets that are not subject to the rule and may cause significant Medicare billing delays for the purchases of home health agencies that are subject to the rule. Further, CMS has implemented a moratorium on enrolling new home health agencies in Texas, Michigan, Florida and Illinois. On July 29, 2018, CMS extended the moratorium for an additional 6 months. If a moratorium is imposed on enrollment of new providers in a geographic area we desire to service, our ability to expand operations may be impacted.\nOur ability to expand operations in a state will depend on our ability to obtain a state license to operate, and where required, CON approval. States may limit the number of licenses they issue. The failure to obtain any required CON or license could impair our ability to operate or expand our business.\nThe implementation of alternative payment models and the transition of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries to managed care organizations may limit our market share and could adversely affect our revenues.\nMany government and commercial payors are transitioning providers to alternative payment models that are designed to promote cost-efficiency, quality and coordination of care. For example, accountable care organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d) incentivize hospitals, physician groups, and other providers to organize and coordinate patient care while reducing unnecessary costs. Several states have implemented, or plan to implement, accountable care models for their Medicaid populations. If we are not included in these programs, or if ACOs establish programs that overlap with our services, we are at risk for losing market share and for a loss of our current business.\nWe may be similarly impacted by increased enrollment of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans, shifting away from traditional fee-for-service models. Under the managed Medicare program, also known as Medicare Advantage, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide Medicare benefits. Insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher plan costs on beneficiaries. Approximately one third of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2018, a figure that continues to grow. While hospice services are currently reimbursed as a traditional fee-for-service program under Medicare Part A, hospice services may eventually be offered under Medicare Advantage plans, which could result in reduced reimbursement, limited utilization, and increased competition for managed care contracts.\nEnrollment in managed Medicaid plans is also growing, as states are increasingly relying on managed care organizations to deliver Medicaid program services as a strategy to control costs and manage resources. We may experience increased competition for managed care contracts due to state regulation and limitations. For instance, effective October 2018, New York limits the number of home care providers with which a managed Medicaid plan can contract. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to be included in plan networks, that we will be able to secure favorable contracts with all or some of the managed care organizations, that our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels, that the authorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance. In addition, operational processes may not be well defined as a state transitions beneficiaries to managed care. For example, membership, new referrals and the related authorization for services to be provided may be delayed, which may result in delays in service delivery to consumers or in payment for services rendered. Difficulties with operational processes may negatively affect our revenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided.\nOther alternative payment models may be presented by the government and commercial payors to control costs that subject our Company to financial risk. We cannot predict at this time what effect alternative payment models may have on our Company.\nOur revenues are concentrated in a small number of states which will make us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states.\nOur revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in states in which we generate a significant portion of our revenues including Illinois, New York and New Mexico. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes to the Medicaid programs in these states could also have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEfforts to reduce the costs of the Illinois Department on Aging programs could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we derived approximately 31.0% and 36.5%, respectively, of our revenue from the Illinois Department on Aging programs. Previous state government officials have attempted to reduce government spending by proposing changes aimed at reducing expenditures by this department. On November 6, 2018, Illinois elected a new governor. The new Democratic governor is expected to be more aligned with the General Assembly. It is expected that initiatives to reduce costs in Illinois, such as shifting services to managed care organizations and implementing a CCP Medicaid Initiative to enroll eligible\nindividuals in Medicaid will continue. The nature and extent of any future cost reduction initiatives is unknown. If future reforms impact the eligibility of consumers for services, the number of hours authorized or otherwise restrict services provided to existing consumers, our service revenues and growth may be adversely affected.\nDelays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits may increase in the future, adversely affecting our liquidity.\nThere is a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. Many of the states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits for their current fiscal year. These and other states may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, from time to time, procedural issues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally, unanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures may adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. We fund operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable.\nFailure to renew a significant agreement or group of related agreements may materially impact our revenue.\nIn 2018, we derived approximately 31.0% of our net service revenues under agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging. Each of our agreements is generally in effect for a specific term.\nEven though our agreements are for a specific term, they are generally terminable with 60 days\u2019 notice. Our ability to renew or retain our agreements depends on our quality of service and reputation, as well as other factors over which we have little or no control, such as state appropriations and changes in provider eligibility requirements. Additionally, failure to satisfy any of the numerous technical renewal requirements in connection with our proposals for agreements could result in a proposal being rejected even if it contains favorable pricing terms. Failure to obtain, renew or retain agreements with major payors may negatively impact our results of operations and revenue. We can give no assurance these agreements will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market-specific.\nWe compete with personal care service providers, hospice providers, home health providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations and self-directed care programs. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition or a larger number of consumers and payors than we do. In addition, some of these organizations offer more services than we do in the markets in which we operate. These competitive advantages may limit our ability to attract and retain referrals in local markets and to increase our overall market share.\nIn many states, there are limited barriers to entry in providing personal care services. However, some states require entities to obtain a license before providing home care services. Licensure is generally required of agencies providing home health and hospice services, though requirements vary by state. Economic changes such as increases in minimum wage and changes in Department of Labor rules can also impact the ease of entry into a market. These factors may affect competition in our states.\nOften our contracts with payors are not exclusive. Local competitors may develop strategic relationships with referral sources and payors. This could result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, existing competitors may offer new or enhanced services that we do not provide, or be viewed by consumers as a more desirable local alternative. The introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in revenue, a loss of market acceptance of our services and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and extensive regulations governing our business, we could be subject to penalties or be required to make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively. The laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, impose certain requirements on the way in which we do business, the services we offer, and our interactions with providers and consumers. These requirements include matters related to:\n\u2022\nlicensure and certification and enrollment with government programs;\n\u2022\neligibility for services;\n\u2022\nappropriateness and necessity of services provided;\n\u2022\nadequacy and quality of services;\n\u2022\nqualifications and training of personnel;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical records;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection, health and safety;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians, other referral sources and recipients of referrals;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services;\n\u2022\nadequacy and manner of documentation for services provided;\n\u2022\nbilling and coding for services;\n\u2022\ntimely and proper handling of overpayments; and\n\u2022\ndebt collection and communications with consumers.\nThese laws include, but are not limited to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark law, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, other federal and state fraud and abuse, insurance fraud, and fee-splitting laws, which may extend to services reimbursable by any payer, including private insurers; and federal and state laws governing the security and privacy of health information.\nWe currently have contractual relationships with current and potential referral sources and recipients, including hospitals and health systems, skilled nursing facilities and certain physicians who provide medical director services to our Company. Federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts throughout the healthcare industry. While we endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our practices are fully compliant or that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret those laws and regulations in ways that will adversely affect our practices. The laws and regulations governing our business are subject to change, interpretations may evolve and enforcement focus may shift. These changes could subject us to allegations of impropriety or illegality, require restructuring of relationships with referral sources and recipients or otherwise require changes to our operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, the termination of rights to participate in federal and state healthcare programs, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, the suspension or revocation of licenses and nonpayment or delays in our ability to bill and collect for services provided, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial results.\nIn addition, as a result of our participation in Medicaid, Medicare and Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, and pursuant to certain of our contractual relationships, we are subject to various reviews, compliance audits and investigations by governmental authorities and other third parties to verify our compliance with these programs and agreements as well as applicable laws, regulations and conditions of participation. Each of our home care and hospice agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. If any of our agencies fail to meet any of the conditions of participation or coverage with respect to state licensure or our participation in Medicaid, Medicare programs, Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable surveyor or authority. Failure to institute a plan of action to correct the deficiency within the period provided by the surveyor or authority could result in civil or criminal penalties, damage to our reputation, cancellation of our agreements, suspension or revocation of our licenses, requirements to repay amounts received, disqualification from federal and state healthcare programs and other negative consequences. These actions may adversely affect our ability to provide certain services, to receive payments from other payors and to continue to operate. Additionally, failure to comply with the conditions of participation related to enrollment could result in a deactivation or revocation of billing privileges. To the extent that billing privileges are revoked, there is a mandated one to three-year bar to re-enrollment. Similarly, we could face liability under the False Claims Act if we submit claims to Medicare or Medicaid while not in compliance with certain conditions of participation. Further, actions taken against one of our offices may subject our other offices to adverse consequences. We may also fail to discover all instances of noncompliance by our acquisition targets, which could subject us to adverse remedies once those acquisitions are complete. Any termination of one or more of our offices from any federal, state or local program for failure to satisfy such program\u2019s conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenues and profitability.\nDelays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.\nThere are delays in reimbursement from the time we provide services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. Delays may result from changes by payors to data submission requirements or requests by fiscal intermediaries for additional data or documentation, among other issues. If we have information system problems or issues that arise with Medicare or Medicaid, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. Such timing delays may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our results of operations and liquidity. System problems, Medicare or Medicaid issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, adversely impact our working capital. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully negate this risk. There are often timing delays when\nattempting to collect funds from Medicaid programs. Delays in receiving reimbursement or payments from these programs may adversely impact our working capital.\nWe are and have been subject to routine and periodic surveys, audits and investigations by various governmental agencies. In addition to surveys to determine compliance with the conditions of participation, CMS has engaged a number of contractors (including Medicare Administrative Contractors, Recovery Audit Contractors, Zone Program Integrity Contractors, Unified Program Integrity Contractors and Medicaid Integrity Contractors) to conduct audits to evaluate billing practices and identify overpayments. These audits can result in recoupments by Medicare and other payors of amounts previously paid to us. In addition to audits by CMS contractors, individual states are implementing similar integrity programs using Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors. We are unable to predict what additional government regulations, if any, affecting our business may be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations either in the markets in which we presently conduct, or wish to commence, business. In June 2016, CMS announced its plans to implement a three-year \u201cPre-Claim Review Demonstration of Home Health Services\u201d in certain states, including Illinois. The demonstration, which involved clinical documentation requirements, sought to improve identification, investigation, and prosecution of Medicare fraud among home health agencies and to reduce expenditures while maintaining or improving quality of care. The demonstration began in Illinois in August 2016, but CMS paused it in April 2017. We are currently unable to predict what impact, if any, this program may have on our result of operations or financial position when and if resumed.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern our employment practices, including minimum wage, living wage, and paid time-off requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes to these laws and regulations that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to employment, including occupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour and other compensation requirements, employee benefits, providing leave and sick pay, employment insurance, proper classification of workers as employees or independent contractors, immigration and equal employment opportunity laws. These laws and regulations can vary significantly among jurisdictions and can be highly technical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal, state or local laws or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, requiring employers to provide specified benefits or rights to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in the level of existing benefits or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be able to offset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws requirements, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSince our operations are concentrated in Illinois, New York and New Mexico, we are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations in these states. For example, in December 2014, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance that will raise the minimum wage for Chicago workers to $13 per hour by 2019, with increases up to $1 per hour effective on July 1 of each year. The rate is $12 per hour effective July 1, 2018. The wage increase in 2016 did not have a material impact on us because of our existing wage scale. The 2017 wage increase was offset by a reimbursement rate increase. In the budget process for the 2019 fiscal year, a similar provision was proposed but was not included in the final budget. We believe that there is legislative support for a reimbursement rate increase and anticipate that an increase to offset the wage increase could be passed in the first half of 2019. Our financial performance will be impacted in quarters for which a reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.\nIn addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal and state healthcare program beneficiaries. If we inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or if any of our current employees or contractors becomes an excluded person in the future without our knowledge, we may be subject to substantial civil penalties, including up to $20,000 for each item or service furnished by the excluded individual to a federal or state healthcare program beneficiary, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and exclusion from the program.\nEach of our subsidiaries that employ an average of at least 50 full-time employees in a calendar year are required to offer a minimum level of health coverage for 95% of our full-time employees in 2018 or be subject to an annual penalty.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by healthcare reform efforts, including repeal of or significant modifications to the ACA.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a large number of laws intended to result in significant change to the healthcare industry. However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the ACA, the most prominent of these reform efforts. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the current presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make additional significant changes to, the ACA, its implementation or its interpretation. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACA's individual mandate to carry health insurance. Because the individual mandate\nwas eliminated, a federal court in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in place pending appeal. In addition, the president has signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize \u201ceconomic and regulatory burdens\u201d of the ACA. Effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in place pending appeal. These changes and court challenges may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. The presidential administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Additionally, all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through further legislation or judicial challenge, which could result in lower numbers of insured individuals, and reduced coverage for insured individuals. Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning in 2013 and have been extended through 2027. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover non-fraudulent overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThere is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants. Government efforts to repeal or change the ACA or to implement alternative reform measures could cause our net revenues to decrease. Some members of Congress have proposed expanding government-funded coverage, including single payor proposals. Furthermore, we are unable to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms that may be implemented by other, non-governmental industry participants.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services is growing among both government and commercial payors. Value-based purchasing programs emphasize quality of outcome and efficiency of care provided, rather than quantity of care provided. For example, Medicare requires hospices and home health agencies to report certain quality data in order to receive full reimbursement. Failure to report quality data or poor performance may negatively impact the amount of reimbursement received. CMS currently has a value-based purchasing program affecting home health providers in a number of pilot states, whereby providers receive payment bonuses or penalties based on their achievement of specified performance measures. CMS may expand this program and establish new programs affecting a broader range of providers. In addition, CMS publishes hospice quality measure data online to allow consumers and others to search and compare data for Medicare-certified hospice providers.\nOther initiatives aimed at improving quality and cost of care include alternative payment models, including ACOs and bundled payment arrangements. It is unclear whether alternative models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease overall reimbursement. Additionally, commercial payors have expressed intent to shift toward value-based reimbursement arrangements.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. While we believe we are adapting our business strategies to compete in a value-based reimbursement environment, we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations. If we perform at a level below the outcomes demonstrated by our competitors, are unable to meet or exceed quality performance standards under any applicable value-based purchasing program, or otherwise fail to effectively provide or coordinate the efficient delivery of quality healthcare services, our reputation in the industry may be negatively impacted, we may receive reduced reimbursement amounts and we may owe repayments to payors, causing our revenues to decline.\nNegative publicity or changes in public perception of our services may adversely affect our ability to receive referrals, obtain new agreements and renew existing agreements.\nOur success in receiving referrals, obtaining new agreements and renewing our existing agreements depends upon maintaining our reputation as a quality service provider among governmental authorities, physicians, hospitals, discharge planning departments, case managers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, advocacy groups, consumers and their families, other referral sources and the public. While we believe that the services that we provide are of high quality, if our quality measures, which are published online by CMS, are deemed to be not of the highest value, our reputation could be negatively affected. Negative publicity, changes in public perceptions of our services or government investigations of our operations could damage our reputation and hinder our ability to receive referrals, retain agreements or obtain new agreements. Increased government scrutiny may also contribute to an increase in compliance costs and could discourage consumers from using our services. Any of these events could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations and we may not be successful in managing this growth.\nOur business plan calls for significant growth in business over the next several years through the expansion of our services in existing markets and the establishment of a presence in new markets. This growth would place significant demands on our management team, systems, internal controls and financial and professional resources. In addition, we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate any such future growth. This could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our inability to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nFuture acquisitions or growth initiatives may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nOur growth strategy includes geographical expansion into new markets and the addition of new services in existing markets through the acquisition of local service providers. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties assimilating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or consumers of acquired providers, and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired providers. In the past, we have made acquisitions that have not performed as expected or that we have been unable to successfully integrate with our existing operations. In addition, our due diligence review of acquired businesses may not successfully identify all potential issues. The failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe have grown our business through de novo offices and we may in the future selectively open new offices in existing and new states. De novo offices involve risks, including those relating to accreditation, hiring new personnel, establishing relationships with referral sources and delays or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems. We may not be successful in establishing de novo offices in a timely manner due to generating insufficient business activity and incurring higher than projected operating cost that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to pursue acquisitions or expand into new geographic regions without obtaining additional capital or consent from our lenders.\nAt December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had cash balances of $70.4 million and $53.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $20.0 million and $44.4 million outstanding debt on our credit facility, respectively. After giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately $10.8 million and $11.8 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and borrowing limits based on an advanced multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $142.9 million and $105.1 million available for borrowing under our credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Since our credit facility provides for borrowings based on a multiple of an EBITDA ratio, any declines in our EBITDA would result in a decrease in our available borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe cannot predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts, our efforts to expand into new geographic regions or the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility, our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing. In the future, we may elect to issue additional equity securities in conjunction with raising capital, completing an acquisition or expanding into a new geographic region. Such issuances could be dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, our ability under our credit facility to consummate acquisitions is restricted if we exceed certain Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement (as defined below)) thresholds, without the consent of the lenders. Further, our credit facility requires, among other things, that we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth therein and that no event of default exists before and after giving effect to any proposed acquisition. Our ability to expand in a manner consistent with historic practices may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consent from our lenders.\nAs a result of the indemnification provisions of the Home Health Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold Home Health Business, we may incur expenses and liabilities related to periods up to the date of sale or pursuant to our other indemnification obligations thereunder.\nAs a result of the indemnification provisions of the Home Health Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold the Home Health Business, we have agreed to indemnify the Purchasers for, among other things, (i) penalties, fines, judgments and settlement amounts arising from a violation of certain specified statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or any state law equivalent in connection with the operation of the Home Health Business prior to the Closing, and (ii) any liability related to the failure of any reimbursement claim submitted to certain government programs for services rendered by the Home Health Business prior to the Closing to meet the requirements of such government programs, or any violation prior to the Closing of any healthcare laws. Such liabilities include amounts to be recouped by, or repaid to, such government programs as a result of improperly submitted claims for reimbursement or those discovered as a result of audits by investigative agencies. All services that we have provided that have been or may be reimbursed by Medicare are subject to retroactive\nadjustments and/or total denial of payments received from Medicare under various review and audit provisions included in the program regulations. The review period is generally described as six years from the date the services are provided but could be expanded to ten years under certain circumstances if fraud is found to have existed at the time of original billing. In the event that there are adjustments relating to the period prior to the Closing, we may be required to reimburse the Purchasers for the amount of such adjustments, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Home Health Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify the Purchasers for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, certain taxes and liabilities related to the pre-Closing period (other than specifically identified assumed liabilities). Any liability we have to the Purchasers under the Home Health Purchase Agreement could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business may be harmed by labor relations matters.\nWe are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because our hourly workforce is highly unionized. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 49.0% of our workforce was represented by the SEIU. We have numerous agreements with local SEIU affiliates which are renegotiated from time to time. These negotiations are often initiated when we receive increases in our hourly rates from various state agencies. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions. A strike, work stoppage or other slowdown could result in a disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business. Labor costs are the most significant component of our total expenditures and, therefore, an increase in the cost of labor could significantly harm our business.\nOur operations subject us to risk of litigation.\nOperating in the personal care services industry exposes us to an inherent risk of wrongful death, personal injury, professional malpractice and other potential claims or litigation brought by our consumers and employees. From time to time, we are subject to claims alleging that we did not properly treat or care for a consumer that we failed to follow internal or external procedures that resulted in death or harm to a consumer or that our employees mistreated our consumers, resulting in death or harm. We are also subject to claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions brought by consumers whom we are transporting, from employees driving to or from home visits or other affected individuals.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies may initiate administrative proceedings alleging violations of statutes and regulations arising from our services and seek to impose monetary penalties on us. We could be required to pay substantial amounts to respond to regulatory investigations or, if we do not prevail, damages or penalties arising from these legal proceedings. We also are subject to potential lawsuits under the federal False Claims Act or other federal and state whistleblower statutes designed to combat fraud and abuse in our industry including the federal False Claims Act litigation discussed in Part I, Item 3 hereof \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d This and other similar lawsuits can involve significant monetary awards or penalties which may not be covered by our insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage and self-insurance coverage reserves are not adequate to cover these claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in our defense, civil lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could distract us from running our business or irreparably damage our reputation.\nOur insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice, the insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to satisfy all claims made against us. We cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of our insurance, and any such claims, if successful and in excess of such limits, may have a material adverse effect on our business or assets. We utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs. If losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in our annual insurance costs and self-insured retention limits depend in large part on the insurance market, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms.\nInclement weather or natural disasters may impact our ability to provide services.\nInclement weather or natural disasters may prevent our employees from providing authorized services. We are not paid for authorized services that are not delivered due to these weather events. Furthermore, prolonged inclement weather or the occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could disrupt our relationships with consumers, employees and referral sources located in affected areas and, in the case of our corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection services. For example, one of our support centers and a number of our agencies are located in the Midwestern United States, New York and California, increasing our exposure to blizzards and other major snowstorms, ice storms, tornadoes, flooding, wildfires and earthquakes. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Future inclement weather or natural disasters may adversely affect our reputation, business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our information systems. Our operations may be disrupted if we are unable to effectively integrate, manage and maintain the security of our information systems.\nOur business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimizing financial performance, adjusting consumer mix, monitoring regulatory compliance and enhancing staff efficiency. We rely on an external service provider, McKesson Information Solutions, LLC (\u201cMcKesson\u201d), to provide continual maintenance, upgrading, and enhancement of our primary information systems used for our operational needs. The software we license from McKesson supports intake, personnel scheduling, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling us to standardize the care delivered across our network of offices and monitor our performance and consumer outcomes. In addition, we also utilize Horizon to support our personal care business for branches acquired through our acquisition of AmberCare in the second quarter of 2018. These locations also provide Home Health and Hospice services. We recently purchased and implemented HomeCare Homebase to support these lines of business. All locations acquired through our recent purchase of Arcadia utilize Continulink for their home care and staffing business. To the extent providers fail to support the software or systems, or if we lose our licenses, our operations could be negatively be affected. Our business also depends on a comprehensive payroll and human resources system for basic payroll functions and reporting, payroll tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments. We rely on an external service provider, ADP, to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary human resource and payroll systems. To the extent that ADP fails to support the software or systems, or any of the related support services provided by them, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nOur business also supports the use of EVV to collect visit submission information through our delivery of home care services. Our solution uses a combination of IVR and GPS enabled smartphones to capture time in and time out, mileage and travel time, as well as the completed care plan tasks. We license this software through CellTrak along with partnering with states who utilize Authenticare, SanData, and HealthStar. We rely on these providers to provide continual maintenance, enhancements, as well as security of any protected data. To the extent that our EVV vendors fail to support these processes, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nUnder the 21st Century Cures Act, as amended, states have until January 1, 2020 to establish standards for EVV for Medicaid-funded personal care services. States that fail to meet this deadline will lose an escalating amount of their funding. To the extent that the states fail to properly implement EVV, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nIf we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses.\nWe have full backup of our key information systems. Should our main datacenter become inoperable because of a natural disaster or terrorist acts, our operations would failover to our geographically separate disaster recovery datacenter with a quick return to operations for all sites and systems. All of our sites and branch offices have redundant connections to our primary and backup datacenters using data lines and cellular connections through VPN or MPLS.\nThe key business functions for our main sites also have redundancies with key functions geographically split between our two main facilities, should one not be available due to the above mentioned scenarios.\nWhile we believe these measures are reasonable, no system of information security is able to eliminate the risk of business disruptions.\nA cyber-attack or security breach could cause a loss of confidential consumer data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law and other legal theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage clinical and financial data, to communicate with our consumers, payors, vendors and other third parties, and to summarize and analyze our operating results. In spite of our policies, procedures and other security measures used to protect our computer systems and data, occasionally, we have experienced breaches that have required us to notify affected consumers and the government, and we have worked with consumers and the government to resolve such issues. While these past breaches have not had a significant adverse impact on our business or results of operations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to additional and/or more severe cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could result in loss of protected patient medical data or other information subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information technology systems or business, potentially exposing us to regulatory action, litigation and liability. We continue to prioritize cyber-security and the development of practices and controls to protect our systems and data. We utilize sophisticated firewalls to mitigate external threats and attacks through daily security content updates and intrusion prevention policies. In addition, all email is scanned for threats and viruses as well as Domain Keys Identified Mail keys authentication and Sender Policy Framework records are utilized\nto mitigate spoofing and phishing attempts. Outgoing email is encrypted based on content and HIPAA regulations. In addition, we are required to comply with the privacy and security laws and regulations of HIPAA as amended by HITECH. If our privacy and security practices are not in compliance with HIPAA and/or if we fail to satisfy applicable breach notification requirements in the event of a security breach, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits and reputational harm.\nOur current principal stockholders could have significant influence over us, and they could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree.\nEos Capital Partners III, L.P. and its affiliates (the \u201cEos Funds\u201d), together beneficially own approximately 20.7% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. As a result, the Eos Funds have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:\n\u2022\nchanges to the composition of our board of directors, which has the authority to direct our business and appoint and remove our officers;\n\u2022\nproposed mergers, consolidations or other business combinations; and\n\u2022\namendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which govern the rights attached to our shares of common stock.\nIn addition, Mark First, one of our directors is affiliated with the Eos Funds.\nThis concentration of ownership of shares of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open-market purchase programs or other purchases of shares of our common stock that might otherwise give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. The interests of the Eos Funds may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or we may incur increased costs in doing so.\nWe must attract and retain qualified non-executive personnel in the markets in which we operate in order to provide our services. We compete for personnel with other providers of social and medical services as well as companies in other service-based industries. This competition has increased significantly as the unemployment rate has decreased in recent years. Increased competition for trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge for our services. An increase in personnel costs could negatively impact our business. In addition, if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our ability to conduct our business operations effectively would be harmed.\nCompetition may be greater for managers, such as regional and agency directors. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide employees with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. The loss of one or more of the members of the executive management team or the inability of a new management team to successfully execute our strategies may adversely affect our business. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline, and we could lose consumers and referral sources.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health catastrophe than other businesses due to the nature of our consumers.\nThe majority of our consumers are older individuals with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or in a public health catastrophe. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable consumers. For example, if a flu pandemic were to occur, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, be required to hire replacements for affected workers. Accordingly, certain public health catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of our executive team members.\nOur success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our executive team to manage several of our key functional areas, including operations, business development, accounting, finance, human resources, marketing, information systems, contracting and compliance. In 2016 and 2017, we changed a majority of the members of senior management, beginning with our CEO. The departure of any member of our executive team may materially adversely affect our operations.\nIf we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill and/or our intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with finite lives represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. For example, if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If as part of our annual review of goodwill and intangibles, we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected, which could affect our flexibility to obtain additional financing. In addition, if our assumptions used in preparing our valuations for purposes of impairment testing differ materially from actual future results, we may record impairment charges in the future and our financial results may be materially adversely affected. We had $135.4 million and $90.3 million of goodwill and $23.8 million and $16.6 million of intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIt is not possible at this time to determine if there will be any future impairment charge, or if there is, whether such charges would be material. We will continue to review our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment. We cannot be certain that a downturn in our business or changes in market conditions will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods, which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods.\nIneffective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires our management to report on, and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Compliance with SEC regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has increased our legal and financial compliance costs making some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nAccordingly, we are required to have an audit of our internal controls over financial reporting. As described under Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d below, our management has determined that a material weakness in internal controls existed as of December 31, 2018. The assessment was based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nTo the extent that we now or in the future have deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are not remediated, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or key operating metrics could be impaired, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements, late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements or other corrective disclosures, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and could create a perception that our financial results do not fairly state our financial condition or results of operations, any of which could have an adverse effect on the value of our stock.\nCompliance with changing regulations including specific program compliance, corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and pose challenges for our management team.\nThe state agencies that contract for our services require our compliance with various rules and regulations affecting the services we provide. We have a compliance officer who monitors and reports on our efforts for achieving the desired results. State agencies are recommending increased rules and regulations in an effort to control the growth of these programs and their overall costs. The implementation of these changes may require us to increase our efforts to remain compliant, may reduce the authorizations for services to be provided, and may result in certain consumers no longer being eligible for our services all of which may result in lower revenues and increased costs, reducing our operating performance and profitability. If we continue to serve our consumers without addressing these increased regulations we are at risk for non-compliance with program requirements and potential penalties.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal controls over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\nOur credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nmake, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all our assets;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including paying dividends and making certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, permit to exist, or otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable with respect to any additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in any line of additional line of business;\n\u2022\namend our organization documents;\n\u2022\nmake a change in accounting treatment or reporting practices, change our name or change our jurisdiction of organization or formation;\n\u2022\nmake any payment or prepayment of certain subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends and certain other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in a sale leaseback or similar transaction; and\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, all amounts outstanding under our credit facility may become immediately due and payable and all commitments under our credit facility to extend further credit may be terminated. The acceleration of any such indebtedness will result in an event of default under all of our other long-term indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of all securities, including securities of healthcare companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance;\n\u2022\nvariances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nwe have a relatively small base of registered shares of common stock that could result in significant stock price movements upward or downward based on low levels of trading volume in our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of common stock or debt or the perception that sales could occur;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our business and our prospects;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to the occurrence of risks impacting our company, including any of the risk factors set forth herein; or\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of homecare companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities. We have been and may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management team\u2019s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends on our shares of common stock and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, credit facility limitations, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Our credit facility restricts our ability to declare or pay any dividend or other distribution to Holdings unless no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would arise as a result thereof and the aggregate amount of dividends and distributions paid in any fiscal year does not exceed $7.5 million per annum.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to publish research or reports about our business or publish negative research or reports, or our results are below analysts\u2019 estimates, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If analysts fail to publish reports on us regularly or at all, we could fail to gain visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more analysts do cover us and downgrade their evaluations of our stock or our results are below analysts\u2019 estimates, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, due to the small number of analysts covering us, a single comment or report from one of the analysts whether positive or negative, could result in a significant increase or decrease in our stock price. Further, our inclusion on or exclusion from various published stock market indices may cause our stock price to rise or decline.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware or certain other state laws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management without the consent of the board of directors. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control include:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This section generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner. However, because the Eos Funds acquired their shares prior to our IPO, Section 203 is currently inapplicable to any business combination with the Eos Funds or their affiliates. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures, which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations. Certain states in which we operate, such as New York, may require regulatory approval of persons meeting such states\u2019 definition of \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d or similar concepts, which could delay or deter a change of control or other business combination with us.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue one or more series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or other terms, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 93073, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "ADUS"}
