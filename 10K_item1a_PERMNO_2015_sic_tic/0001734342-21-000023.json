{"cik": "1734342", "company": "Amerant Bancorp Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties that could potentially negatively impact our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. This section contains a description of the risk and uncertainties identified by management that could, individually or in combination, harm our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as of our financial instruments and our securities. In evaluating us and our business and making or continuing an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this Form 10-K and any risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. We may face other risks that are not contained in this Form 10-K, including additional risk that are not presently known, or that we presently deem immaterial. This Form 10-K and the risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section in this Form 10-K titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur profitability is subject to interest rate risk.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income will be adversely affected by market interest rate changes where the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments. Since our balance sheet is asset sensitive, a decrease in interest rates or a flattening or inversion of the yield curve could adversely affect us. Changes in market interest rates are unpredictable as they are affected by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions (inflation, recession, unemployment), fiscal and monetary policy, and changes in the United States and other financial markets. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the financial markets and has prompted several actions by the Federal Reserve that have resulted in the decline of market interest rates to historical lows. This decline in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income, margins and profitability, particularly if it is prolonged for a significant time period.\nThe production of mortgages and other loans and the value of collateral securing our loans, are dependent on interest rates as well as demand within the markets we serve. Increases in interest rates generally decrease the market values of fixed-rate, interest-bearing investments and loans held, the value of mortgage and other loans produced, including long term fixed-rate loans and the value of loans sold, mortgage loan activities and the collateral securing our loans, and therefore may adversely affect our liquidity and earnings, to the extent not offset by potential increases in our net interest margin, or NIM. In addition, in declining rate environments, we may experience a significant number of loan prepayments and replacement loans may be priced at a lower rate generating a decrease in our net interest income.\nWe may be adversely affected by the transition of LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe anticipated cessation of LIBOR quotes after 2021 creates substantial risks to the banking industry, including us. A significant number of our loans, borrowings, derivative contracts and financial instruments are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR and the transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risks. Unless alternative rates can be negotiated and determined, our floating rate loans, funding and derivative obligations that specify the use of a LIBOR index, will no longer adjust and may become fixed rate instruments at the time LIBOR ceases to exist. This would adversely affect our asset/liability management and could lead to more asset and liability mismatches and interest rate risk unless appropriate LIBOR alternatives are developed. The expected discontinuance of LIBOR may also affect interest rate hedges and result in certain of these becoming ineffective and ineligible for hedge accounting. It could also disrupt the capital and credit markets as a result of confusion or uncertainty.\nSeveral regulators, including the Federal Reserve, and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries have sponsored initiatives aimed at (a) transitioning to alternative reference rates and (b) addressing risks related to the language in legacy contracts given the possibility that LIBOR might cease being published. In spite of progress made by regulators and market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR, uncertainties still remain; including whether replacement benchmark rates will become a market standard that replaces LIBOR, and if so, its effects on the terms of any transaction or financial instrument, our customers, or our future results of operations or financial condition. We are unable to predict what the impact of transition from LIBOR will be and if we fail to successfully manage the transition it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur concentration of CRE loans could result in increased loan losses, and adversely affect our business, earnings, and financial condition.\nCRE is cyclical and poses risks of possible loss due to concentration levels and risks of the assets being financed, which include loans for the acquisition and development of land and residential, multifamily, retail, office, industrial and hotel construction.\nThe Bank\u2019s portfolio of CRE loans was 325.0% of its risk-based capital, or 48.6% of its total loans, as of December 31, 2020 compared to 353.3% of its risk-based capital, or 51.7% of its total loans, as of December 31, 2019. Our CRE loans included approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of fixed rate loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In a rising interest rate environment, fixed rate loans may adversely affect our margin and present asset/liability mismatches and risks since our liabilities are generally floating rate or have shorter maturities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 52% of total CRE loans were in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, Florida, 24% were in the greater New York City area, including all five boroughs, and 16% were in the greater Houston, Texas area. The remainder were in other Florida, Texas and New York/New Jersey markets. Our CRE loans are affected by economic conditions in those markets.\nIn addition, lower demand for CRE, and reduced availability of, and higher costs for, CRE lending could adversely affect our CRE loans and sales of our other real estate owned, or OREO, and therefore impact our earnings and financial condition, including our capital and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the economy and real estate markets. Although the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement since the outset of the pandemic, they remain at depressed levels in certain regions. If this positive trend were to revert and decline, we may experience higher than normal delinquencies and loan losses. In addition, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, management believes that it could significantly affect the economic conditions of the market areas we serve and we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and loan losses.\nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have unique risks compared to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $2.8 billion or 49% and $1.2 billion or 20% of our loan portfolio was comprised of CRE loans and commercial loans, respectively. Since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, their repayment is sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. Consequently, downturns in the real estate market and economy increase the risk related to commercial loans, particularly CRE loans. In addition, loan specific risks may also affect commercial loans, including risks associated with construction, cost overruns, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk and risks associated with the ultimate sale or use of the completed construction. If a decline in economic conditions, natural disasters affecting business development or other issues cause difficulties for our borrowers of these types of loans, if we fail to assess the credit of these loans accurately when underwriting them or if we fail to adequately continue to monitor the performance of these loans, our loan portfolio could\nexperience delinquencies, defaults and credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.\nWe periodically review our allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. We cannot be certain that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets, and changes in borrower behaviors. Differences between our actual experience and assumptions and the effectiveness of our models may adversely affect our business, financial condition, including liquidity and capital, and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically perform reviews of our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase of our provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of management. As a result, we may elect, or be required, to make further increases in our provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions remain challenging for a significant time period or deteriorate further.\nIn addition, in June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standard Update, ASU, that changed the loss model to consider current expected credit losses, or CECL. As an EGC, CECL will be effective for our first fiscal quarter beginning after December 31, 2022. However, if we cease to be an EGC, CECL becomes effective for our first fiscal quarter after losing the EGC status. CECL will substantially change how we calculate our allowance for loan losses. We cannot predict when and how it will affect our results of operations and the volatility of such results and our financial condition, including our regulatory capital.\nThe collateral securing our loans may not be sufficient to protect us from a partial or complete loss if we are required to foreclose.\nSome of our loans are secured by a lien on specified collateral of our customers. However, the collateral may not protect us from suffering a loss if we foreclose on the collateral. Several factors may negatively impact the value of the collateral that we have a security interest in, including: changes in general economic and industry conditions; changes in the real estate markets in which we lend; inherent uncertainties in the future value of the collateral; the financial condition and/or cash flows of the borrower and/or the project being financed; and, any representation by the borrower of, or failure to keep adequate records related to, important information concerning the collateral.\nAny one or more of the preceding factors could materially impair our ability to collect on specified collateral of our customers in the event loans we have made to such customers are not repaid in accordance with their terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risks could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition and certain funding sources could increase our interest rate expense.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, proceeds from loan repayments or sales, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, core (domestic and foreign) and non-core deposits (such as reciprocal deposit programs and brokered deposits), and short-and long-term debt, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, or FHLB, advances. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity. Any significant restriction or disruption of our ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on our ability to satisfy our current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe use of brokered deposits and wholesale funding not only increases our liquidity risk but could also increase our interest rate expense and potentially increase our deposit insurance costs. Our brokered deposits at December 31, 2020 were 11.1% of total deposits. Wholesale funding, which includes FHLB advances and brokered deposits, represented 24.8% of our total funding at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $530.0 million of FHLB advances with interest rates ranging from 0.62% to 0.97% which are callable prior to their maturity. This feature, if acted upon, could cause the cost of this funding to increase faster than anticipated. In addition, excessive reliance on brokered deposits and wholesale funding is viewed by the regulators as potentially risky for all institutions and may adversely affect our liquidity and the regulatory views of our liquidity. Institutions that are less than well-capitalized may be unable to raise or renew brokered deposits under the prompt corrective action rules. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Capital.\u201d\nWe may be able, depending upon market conditions, to otherwise borrow money or issue and sell debt and preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy in general. Our ability to borrow or obtain funding, if needed, could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. In addition, Alternative funding to deposits may carry higher costs than sources currently utilized. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive and potentially less stable funding sources, profitability and liquidity could be adversely affected. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and our credit capacity. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Federal Reserve Act, Section 23A, limits our ability to borrow from the Bank, and the Company generally relies on dividends paid from the Bank for funds to meet its obligations, including under its outstanding trust preferred securities and senior debt securities. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by law and may be limited by regulatory action to preserve the Bank\u2019s capital adequacy. Any such limitations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nOur valuation of securities and investments and the determination of the impairment amounts taken on our investments are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nFixed maturity securities, as well as short-term investments that are reported at estimated fair value, represent the majority of our total investments. We define fair value generally as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable and certain asset classes may become illiquid. In those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and management judgment. Valuations may result in estimated fair values which vary significantly from the amount at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially affect the valuation of securities in our financial statements and the period-to-period changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt securities available for sale investment portfolio was approximately $1.2 billion and we had pretax accumulated unrealized gains on those securities of $37.3 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include but are not limited to increases or decreases in interest rates, rating agency downgrades of the securities and defaults. Decreases in the estimated fair value of securities we hold may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. We reflect any changes in impairments in earnings as such evaluations are revised. However, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. In addition, any such future impairments or allowances could have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and financial position. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nOur strategic plan and growth strategy may not be achieved as quickly or as fully as we seek.\nWe have adopted and continue to implement and refine our strategic plan to simplify our business model and focus our activities as a community bank serving our domestic customers and select foreign depositors and wealth management customers. Our plan includes a focus on profitable growth, cross selling to gain a larger share of our respective customers' business, core deposit generation, loan growth in our local markets, changes in loan mix to higher margin loans, improving our customer experience, improving our business and operational processes, and achieving operating efficiencies and cost reductions.\nThe strategic plan's technology changes and systems conversions involve execution risk and other risks. Our plans may take longer than we anticipate to implement, and the results we achieve may not be as successful as we seek, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Many of these factors, including interest rates, are not within our control. Additionally, the results of our strategic plan are subject to the other risks described herein that affect our business, which include: lending, seeking deposits and wealth management clients in highly competitive domestic markets; our ability to achieve our growth plans or to manage our growth effectively; the benefits from our technology investments may take longer than expected to be realized and may not be as large as expected, or may require additional investments; and if we are unable to reduce our cost structure, we may not be able to meet our profitability objectives.\nNonperforming and similar assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our nonperforming loans totaled $87.7 million and $32.9 million, respectively, or 1.5% and 0.6% of total loans, respectively. In addition, we had OREO of $0.4 million and $42 thousand at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our non-performing assets may adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO, and these assets require higher loan administration and other costs, thereby adversely affecting our income. Decreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral, or in the related borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental to their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans, OREO and similar nonperforming assets in the future.\nWe may be contractually obligated to repurchase mortgage loans we sold to third-parties on terms unfavorable to us.\nAs a routine part of our business, we originate mortgage loans that we subsequently sell in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans. We do not currently originate mortgage loans for direct sale to any governmental agencies and government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, but expect to make such direct sales in the future. In connection with the sale of these loans to private investors and GSEs, we make customary representations and warranties, the breach of which may result in our being required to repurchase the loan or loans. Furthermore, the amount paid may be greater than the fair value of the loan or loans at the time of the repurchase. No mortgage loan repurchase requests have been made to us; however, if repurchase\nrequests were made to us, we may have to establish reserves for possible repurchases, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMortgage Servicing Rights, or MSRs, requirements may change and require us to incur additional costs and risks.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, adopted new residential mortgage servicing standards in January 2014 that add additional servicing requirements, increase our required servicer activities and delay foreclosures, among other things. These may adversely affect our costs to service residential mortgage loans, and together with the Basel III Capital Rules, may decrease the returns on MSRs. Declines in interest rates tend to reduce the value of MSRs as refinancing may reduce serviced mortgages.\nThe CFPB and the bank regulators continue to bring enforcement actions and develop proposals, rules and practices that could increase the costs of providing mortgage servicing. Historically, we have not serviced mortgage loans for others. However, if we were to provide servicing in the future, regulation of mortgage servicing could make it more difficult and costly to timely realize the value of collateral securing such loans upon a borrower default.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete effectively in highly competitive markets.\nThe banking markets in which we do business are highly competitive and our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets. We compete for deposits, loans, and other financial services in our markets with other local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage lenders, trust services providers and securities advisory and brokerage firms. Marketplace lenders operating nationwide over the internet are also growing rapidly, other fintech developments, including blockchain and other technologies, may potentially disrupt the financial services industry and impact the way banks do business. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we are able to and have broader and more diverse customer and geographic bases to draw upon. The Dodd-Frank Act allows others to branch into our markets more easily from other states. Failures of other banks with offices in our markets and small institutions wishing to sell or merge due to cost pressures could also lead to the entrance of new, stronger competitors in our markets.\nDefaults by or deteriorating asset quality of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and investment funds, our correspondent banks and other financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of the default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also may have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivatives and other securities. Further, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in response to financial crises affecting the global banking system and financial markets, such as nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks\u2019 creditworthiness, could adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. Any losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be required to write down our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nWe had goodwill of $19.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, which primarily represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets of a savings bank acquired in 2006 and the Cayman Bank Acquisition in 2019. We perform our goodwill impairment testing annually using a process which requires the use of fair value estimates and judgment. The estimated fair value is affected by the performance of the business, which may be especially diminished by prolonged market declines. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Although we have had no goodwill write-downs historically, any such write-downs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. Also, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company completed an assessment of goodwill for potential impairment on an interim basis as of June 30 and September 30, 2020 and although it did not identify any impairment in these instances, there can be no assurance that prolonged market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will not result in impairments to goodwill in future periods.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the timing differences between financial accounting and tax reporting. Deferred tax assets, or DTAs, are assessed periodically by management to determine whether they are realizable. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate future taxable income. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, changes in the corporate tax rates could affect the value of our DTAs and may require a write-off of a portion of some of those assets. The Tax Cuts and JOBS ACt of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective for periods starting January 1, 2018, from a prior rate of 35%. In December 2017, we remeasured our net DTAs and recorded $9.6 million in additional tax expense and a corresponding reduction in net income as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. At December 31, 2020, we had net DTAs with a book value of $11.7 million, based on a U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nIn addition, long-lived assets, including assets such as real estate, also require impairment testing. This testing is done to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we will be unable to recover the carrying amount of these assets. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nOur historical consolidated financial data are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a separate company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nBecause we completed a Spin-off from our Former Parent in August of 2018, our historical consolidated financial data included herein does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. We underwent a comprehensive strategic planning process to evaluate how we conduct business, including how to focus on our domestic U.S. business while better serving our valued foreign customers, reducing costs, and increasing core deposits, fee income, margins, and the number of services we provide per household and our profitability. As a result of these matters, among others, it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on favorable terms.\nWe anticipate that our current capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future under currently effective regulatory capital rules. We may, however, need to raise additional capital to support our growth or currently unanticipated losses, or to meet the needs of the communities we serve. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, among other things, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which may be limited by events outside our control, and on our financial performance. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be limited.\nRisks Related to Conditions in Venezuela\nConditions in Venezuela could adversely affect our operations.\nAt December 31, 2020, 37.0% of our deposits, or approximately $2.1 billion, were from Venezuelan residents. The Bank\u2019s Venezuelan deposits declined from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2020 (see Deposits by Country of Domicile in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). These declines were due in part to actions by the Company to reduce its compliance costs and from economic conditions in Venezuela that adversely affected our Venezuelan customers\u2019 ability to generate and save U.S. dollars and the use of their deposits to fund living expenses and other investment activities. All of the Bank\u2019s deposits are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Adverse economic conditions in Venezuela may continue to negatively affect our Venezuelan deposit base and our ability to retain and grow these relationships, as customers rely on their Dollar deposits to spend without being able to earn additional Dollars.\nIn addition, although we seek to increase our trust, brokerage and investment advisory business from our domestic markets, substantially all our revenue from these services currently is from Venezuelan customers. Economic and other conditions in Venezuela, or U.S. regulations or sanctions affecting the services we may provide to our Venezuelan customers may adversely affect the amounts of assets we manage or custody, and the trading volumes of our Venezuelan customers, reducing fees and commissions we earn from these businesses.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities to mitigate its spread has significantly impacted economic conditions, and a future outbreak of COVID-19 or another highly contagious disease, could adversely affect our business activities, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and subsequently, on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and another pandemic in the future could have, a negative impact on the economy and financial markets, globally and in the United States.\nIn many countries, including the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of measures by governmental authorities to contain its spread, including \u201cshelter at home\u201d orders, as well as mandating business and school closures and restricting travel, has had a significant negative impact on economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets and the United States economy, which has and could continue to disrupt the business, activities and operations of our customers, as well as of our business and operations.\nSeveral states and cities across the United States, including the States of Florida, New York and Texas and cities where we have banking centers, LPOs and where our principal place of business is located, have also implemented quarantines, restrictions on travel, \u201cshelter at home\u201d orders, and restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. While following the declaration of the pandemic, some of these measures and restrictions have been lifted, and certain businesses reopened, the Company cannot predict when circumstances may change and restrictions currently in place may be lifted, or whether restrictions that have been lifted will need to be imposed or tightened in the future if viewed as necessary due to public health concerns. Although several vaccines to limit the effects and spread of COVID-19 have been developed and approved, their rollout and administration to the population in the United States and globally is still in its initial stages. In addition, the efficacy of these vaccines in fighting and/or preventing recently identified and more contagious variants of COVID-19 is still undetermined. A significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, particularly if they occur in the markets where we operate, may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain it, almost every industry has been and is being directly or indirectly impacted, including industries in which our customers operate.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the financial markets and has prompted several actions by the Federal Reserve that affect us. Market interest rates have declined significantly and are at historical lows. These decline in interest rates, particularly if they are sustained for a significant time, could adversely affect our net interest income, margins and profitability. Also, since the start of the pandemic, a number of our customers have requested and been granted by the Company loan payment relief options, including deferral and/or forbearance options. In addition, in the first and second quarters of 2020, the Company significantly increased its provision for loan losses primarily due to estimated losses reflecting deterioration in the macro-economic environment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple impacted sectors. The longer and more profound the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has globally, in the United States and on our customers and their businesses, the more likely we will have to recognize loan losses or continue to increase the provision for loan losses and we could continue to experience a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including the implementation of temporary branch and office closures as well as a remote work protocol due to the need to implement social distancing and limit occupancy of businesses in the states and cities where we operate. An extended period of remote work arrangements could introduce operational risks, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and limit our ability to provide services and products to our customers and, in general, manage our business.\nAlso, the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, could have material adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to, several factors including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022The reduced economic activity may severely impact our customers' businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may prevent one or more of our customers from meeting their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations;\n\u2022 A decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio leading to a need to increase our allowance for loan losses;\n\u2022A decline in the credit quality of loans used as collateral to obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank may trigger a request to replace the loans used as collateral with securities and may negatively impact our liquidity ratio;\n\u2022 A significant decline in the value of the collateral used to secure loans that have a related interest rate swap agreement may limit our ability to realize enough value from the collateral to cover the outstanding balance of the loan and the related swap liability;\n\u2022any impairment in value of our tangible and/or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions;\n\u2022 the reduced economic activity could develop into a local and/or global economic recession, which could adversely affect the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022 increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence, which could adversely affect account openings and result in decreased deposit activity and increased withdrawal activity;\n\u2022the potential volatility in the fair value and yields of our investment portfolio;\n\u2022 a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may affect our ability to access the debt and/or equity markets in the future on attractive terms, or at all, or negatively impact our credit ratings; and\n\u2022 any reduction/impairment in value of the collateral used by our customers to secure their obligations with us that could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 over the Company and its customers will depend on a number of issues and future developments, which, at this time, are extremely uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate the impact of the pandemic, and the direct and indirect effects that the pandemic and related containment measures may have, among others.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance of the Company and the rapid development and fluidity of the situation surrounding the pandemic prevents any prediction as to its full adverse impact. Moreover, many risk factors described in this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a participating lender in the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), the Company and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s customers or other parties regarding the Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nThe Company is participating as an eligible lender in a loan program created under the CARES Act and administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to several limitations and eligibility criteria. Since the inception of the PPP several financial institutions have been subject to litigation regarding the processes and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. The Company and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, both from customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. In addition to litigation, our participation in the PPP exposes us to the possibility of governmental investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity. If any litigation, enforcement action or other action is filed against the Company and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company's reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of the outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or damage to our reputation caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nRisks Related to Risk Management, Internal Audit, Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls\nPotential gaps in our risk management policies and internal audit procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur enterprise risk management and internal audit programs are designed to mitigate material risks and loss to us. We have developed and continue to develop risk management and internal audit policies and procedures to reflect ongoing reviews of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not identify every risk to which we are exposed, and our internal audit process may fail to detect such weaknesses or deficiencies in our risk management framework. Many of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior to model or project potential future exposure. Models used by our business are based on assumptions and projections. These models may not operate properly or our inputs and assumptions may be inaccurate, or may not be adopted quickly enough to reflect changes in behavior, markets or technology. As a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly different and greater than historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will closely follow our risk management policies and procedures, nor can there be any assurance that our risk management policies and procedures will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit timely our exposures based on our assessments. All of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may determine that our internal controls and disclosure controls could have deficiencies or weaknesses.\nWe regularly review our internal controls for deficiencies and weaknesses. We have had no material weaknesses, but we have had deficiencies in the past. Although we seek to prevent, discover and promptly cure any deficiencies or weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting, or ICFR, we may have material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future. If we are unable to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by law or Nasdaq rules. Failure to comply with the SEC internal controls regulations could also potentially subject us to investigations or enforcement actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. If we fail to implement and maintain effective ICFR, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our periodic reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, suspension or delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Such events could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline and our access to the capital markets or other financing sources could be limited.\nRisks Related to Technology and our Information Systems\nTechnological changes affect our business including potentially impacting the revenue stream of traditional products and services, and we may have fewer resources than many competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, mainly provided by third party vendors, and a growing demand for mobile and other smart device and computer banking applications. In addition to allowing us to service our clients better, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs and the risks associated with fraud and other operational risks. Technological changes may impact our product and service offerings and may negatively affect the revenue stream of our traditional products and services. The largely unregulated Fintech industry has increased its participation in the lending and payments businesses, and has increased competition in these businesses. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that meet our customers\u2019 preferences and which create additional efficiencies in operations, while controlling the risk of cyberattacks and disruptions, and data breaches. Our strategic plan contemplates simplifying and improving our information technology, and making significant additional investments in technology. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly or at the costs anticipated. Furthermore, replacing third-party dependent solutions may also be time consuming and could potentially create disruptions with other already implemented solutions. Such technology may prove less effective than anticipated, and conversion issues may increase the costs of the new technology and delay its use. Many larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and, increasingly, non-banking firms are using technology to compete with traditional lenders for loans and other banking services.\nOur information systems may experience interruptions and security breaches, and are exposed to cybersecurity threats.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems, including those provided by third-party service providers, to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or security breach of these systems could result in failures or disruptions which could affect our customers\u2019 privacy and our customer relationships, generally. Our systems and networks, as well as those of our third-party service providers, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks. Financial institutions and their service providers are regularly attacked, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attack methods, including use of stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, structured query language injection attacks, and distributed denial-of-service attacks, among others. Such cyberattacks may also be directed at disrupting the operations of public companies or their business partners, which are intended to effect unauthorized fund transfers, obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, sabotage systems, and/or cause serious reputational harm often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nDespite our cybersecurity policies and procedures and our efforts to monitor and ensure the integrity of our and our service providers\u2019 systems, we may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, nor may we be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies. These risks may increase in the future as the use of mobile banking and other internet-based products and services continues to grow.\nSecurity breaches or failures may have serious adverse financial and other consequences, including significant legal and remediation costs, disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, damage to systems operated by us or our third-party service providers, as well as damaging our customers and our counterparties. Such losses and claims may not be covered by our insurance. In addition to the immediate costs of any failure, interruption or security breach, including those at our third-party service providers, these events could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our reputation and subject us to financial sanctions and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious federal, state and foreign laws enforced by the bank regulators and other agencies protect the privacy and security of customers\u2019 non-public personal information. Many of our employees have access to, and routinely process, sensitive personal customer information, including through their access to information technology systems. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, the Company and its employees. It is possible that an employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. Such personal data could also be compromised by third-party hackers via intrusions into our systems or those of service providers or persons we do business with such as credit bureaus, data processors and merchants who accept credit or debit cards for payment; as well as brand impersonation phishing attacks that seek to obtain customers\u2019 personal data through the use of fraudulent emails and/or websites impersonating the Company\u2019s brand. If we are subject to a successful cyberattack or fail to maintain adequate internal controls, or if our employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such cyberattacks, if they result from internal control inadequacies or non-compliance, could materially damage our reputation, lead to civil or criminal penalties, or both, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions and Expansion Activities\nFuture acquisitions and expansion activities may disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we may consider the acquisition of other businesses. If we do seek acquisitions, we expect that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. In addition, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we may believe is in our best interests. Additionally, regulatory approvals could contain conditions that reduce the anticipated benefits of a contemplated transaction. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity per share of our common stock.\nTo the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, banking centers, or businesses, as well as other geographic (domestic and international) and product expansion activities, involve various risks, including: risks of unknown or contingent liabilities; unanticipated costs and delays; risks that acquired new businesses will not perform consistent with our growth and profitability expectations; risks of entering new markets (domestic and international) or product areas where we have limited experience; risks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures; exposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions; difficulties, expenses and delays in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired institutions or business generation teams; potential disruptions to our business; possible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions; potential short-term decreases in profitability; and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our existing operations and business.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, including the Senior Notes.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our debt or to refinance our debt will depend on our future operating performance. Prevailing economic conditions (including low interest rates and reduced economic activity due to COVID-19), regulatory constraints, including, among other things, limitations on distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to our subsidiary bank and non-banking subsidiaries, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will also affect our ability to meet these needs. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe and Amerant Florida, the subsidiary guarantor, are each a holding company with limited operations and depend on our subsidiaries for the funds required to make payments of principal and interest on the Senior Notes.\nWe and the subsidiary guarantor are each a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our and our subsidiary guarantor\u2019s primary source of funds to make payments of principal and interest on the Senior Notes and to satisfy any obligations under the guarantee, respectively, and to satisfy any other financial obligations are dividends from the Bank. Our and the subsidiary guarantor\u2019s ability to receive dividends from the Bank is contingent on a number of factors, including the Bank\u2019s ability to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, the Bank\u2019s profitability and earnings, and the general strength of its balance sheet. Various federal and state regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends bank subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. In general, the Bank may only pay dividends either out of its net income after any required transfers to surplus or reserves have been made or out of its retained earnings. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that insured banks and bank holding companies generally should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.\nBanks and their holding companies are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% in addition to satisfying other applicable regulatory capital ratios. Banking institutions that do not maintain capital in excess of the capital conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Accordingly, if the Bank fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, dividends to us or the subsidiary guarantor from the Bank may be prohibited or limited, and there may be insufficient funds to make principal and interest payments on the Senior Notes or to satisfy any obligation under the guarantee.\nIn addition, state or federal banking regulators have broad authority to restrict the payment of dividends, including in circumstances where a bank under such regulator\u2019s jurisdiction engages in (or is about to engage in) unsafe or unsound practices. Such regulators have the authority to require that a bank cease and desist from unsafe and unsound practices and to prevent a bank from paying a dividend if its financial condition is such that the regulator views the payment of a dividend to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.\nAccordingly, we can provide no assurance that we or the subsidiary guarantor will receive dividends from the Bank in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or to satisfy any obligations under the guarantee. In addition, our right and the rights of our creditors, including holders of the Senior Notes, to participate in the assets of any non-guarantor subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization would be subject to the prior claims of such non-guarantor subsidiary\u2019s creditors, except to the extent that we or the subsidiary guarantor may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against such non-guarantor subsidiary.\nWe may incur a substantial level of debt that could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Notes.\nNeither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, are subject to any limitations under the terms of the indenture governing the terms of the Senior Notes from issuing, accepting or incurring any amount of additional debt, deposits or other liabilities, including senior indebtedness or other obligations ranking equally with the Senior Notes. We expect that we and our subsidiaries will incur additional debt and other liabilities from time to time, and our level of debt and the risks related thereto could increase.\nA substantial level of debt could have important consequences to us, holders of the Senior Notes and our shareholders, including the following: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Senior Notes; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.\nRisks Related to External and Market Factors\nOur business may be adversely affected by economic conditions in general and by conditions in the financial markets.\nWe are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy and market conditions generally. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and another pandemic in the future could have, a negative impact on the economy and financial markets, globally and in the United States. In many countries, including the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The outbreak has been continuously evolving and actions taken around the world to help mitigate its spread have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many regions, including the markets we serve as well as industries in which we regularly extend credit.\nWhile domestic demand for loans has relatively increased since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional significant gains will depend on sustained economic growth. In addition, interest rates have been low for an extended period in recent years and remain at historically low levels that have placed and continue to place pressure on our NIM. Any further declines in interest rates will place additional competitive pressure on net interest margins. On the contrary, increases in interest rates will generate competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds. We are unable to accurately predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact these changes will have on our results of operations.\nAlthough there have been recent positive developments in relation to unemployment data, the housing sector, and credit quality, we do not expect that the current uncertain economic conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near term. If the economy were to deteriorate further, it may impact us in significant and unpredictable ways. In connection with these events, we may face the following particular risks: market developments may negatively affect industries we extend credit to and may result in increased delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could negatively impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses; market disruptions could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective and may negatively affect our ability to measure the fair value of our assets; and, loan performance could deteriorate, loan default levels and foreclosure activity increase and or our assets could materially decline in value. Any of these risks individually or a combination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFor an additional discussion on the potential risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see the risk captioned \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities to mitigate its spread has significantly impacted economic conditions, or an outbreak of another highly contagious disease, could adversely affect our business activities, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d above.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe and our subsidiaries are regulated by several regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC, FINRA, and CIMA. Our success is affected by regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies, and the securities markets, and our costs of compliance could adversely affect our earnings. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and the FDIC\u2019s DIF, not shareholders. From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations of us which, if not determined satisfactorily, could have a material adverse effect on us. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and costly and may affect our profitability.\nThe financial services industry also is subject to frequent legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes. The nature, effects and timing of administrative and legislative change, and possible changes in regulation or regulatory approach resulting from the 2020 general election cannot be predicted. The federal bank regulators and the Treasury Department, as well as the Congress and the President, are evaluating the regulation of banks, other financial services providers and the financial markets and such changes, if any, could require us to maintain more capital and liquidity, and restrict our activities, which could adversely affect our growth, profitability and financial condition.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations are increasingly common in our businesses and may result in significant financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.\nWe face risks of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. We presently do not have any material pending litigation or regulatory matters affecting us.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant legal costs, divert management resources away from our business, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand on our existing business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees could be materially and adversely affected. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may also adversely affect the prices or volatility of our securities specifically, or the securities of our industry, generally.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards, and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected.\nWe, as a bank holding company, and the Bank are subject to capital rules of the Federal Reserve and the OCC, that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III. The Basel III Capital Rules include a minimum ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets); a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of at least 4.0%. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Basel III Capital Rules.\u201d\nThe capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital. For example, the rules provide that newly issued trust preferred securities cannot be a component of a holding company\u2019s Tier 1 capital. As of December 31, 2020, we had $62.3 million of trust preferred securities outstanding that were issued as Tier 1 capital, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if we grow to $15 billion or more in total assets. We have established capital ratio targets that align with U.S. regulatory expectations under the Basel III Capital Rules. Any failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d for bank regulatory purposes, including meeting the Basel III Capital Rule\u2019s conservation buffer, could affect customer confidence, and our: ability to grow; costs of and availability of funds; FDIC deposit insurance premiums; ability to raise, rollover or replace brokered deposits; ability to make acquisitions, open new branches or engage in new activities; flexibility if we become subject to prompt corrective action restrictions; ability to make payments of principal and interest on our capital instruments; and ability to pay dividends on our capital stock.\nThe regulatory capital rules applicable to us and the Bank may continue to change due to new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States. We cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on us and the Bank.\nWe will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements if our total assets grow in excess of $10 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total assets were $7.8 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. Based on our current total assets and growth strategy, we anticipate our total assets may exceed $10 billion within the next five years. In addition to our current regulatory requirements, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are, among other things: examined directly by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial laws; subject to reduced dividends on the Bank\u2019s holdings of Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta common stock; subject to limits on interchange fees pursuant to the \u201cDurbin Amendment\u201d to the Dodd-Frank Act; subject to certain enhanced prudential standards; and no longer treated as a \u201csmall institution\u201d for FDIC deposit insurance assessment purposes.\nCompliance with these additional ongoing requirements may necessitate additional personnel, the design and implementation of additional internal controls, or the incurrence of other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our regulators may also consider our preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements in the course of examining our operations generally or when considering any request from us or the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve, which examines us, expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act to require that all companies that control an FDIC-insured depository institution serve as a source of financial strength to the depository institution. Under this requirement, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress, even if further investment was not otherwise warranted. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe may face higher risks of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations than other financial institutions.\nThe USA Patriot and BSA and the related federal regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers and of beneficial owners of their legal entity customers. In addition, FinCEN, which was established as part of the Treasury Department to combat money laundering, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of anti-money laundering rules.\nThere is also regulatory scrutiny of compliance with the rules of the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, including sanctions against foreign countries, regimes and individuals, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Executive Orders have sanctioned the Venezuelan government and entities it owns, and certain Venezuelan persons. In addition, the OCC has broad authority to bring enforcement actions and to impose monetary penalties if it determines that there are deficiencies in the Bank\u2019s compliance with anti-money laundering laws.\nMonitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and OFAC rules is complex and expensive. The risk of noncompliance with such rules can be more acute for financial institutions like us that have a significant number of customers from, or which do business in Latin America. As of December 31, 2020, $2.1 billion, or 37.0%, of our total deposits were from residents of Venezuela. Our total loan exposure to international markets, primarily individuals in Venezuela and corporations in other Latin American countries, was $152.9 million, or 2.62%, of our total loans, at December 31, 2020.\nIn recent years, we have expended significant management and financial resources to further strengthen our anti-money laundering compliance program. Although we believe our anti-money laundering and OFAC compliance programs, and our current policies and procedures and employees dedicated to these activities, are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations, and continued enhancements are ongoing, we cannot guarantee that our program will prevent all attempts by customers to utilize the Bank in money laundering or financing impermissible under current sanctions and OFAC rules, or sanctions against Venezuela, and certain persons there. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or fail to prevent violations of law or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and formal regulatory enforcement actions, including possible cease and desist orders, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, regulatory limitations on implementing certain aspects\nof our business plan, including acquisitions or banking center relocation or expansion, and require us to expend additional resources to cure any deficiency, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nFailures to comply with the fair lending laws, CFPB regulations or the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, could adversely affect us.\nThe Bank is subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA, and the Fair Housing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex and familial status in any aspect of a consumer, commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. Failures to comply with ECOA, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including CFPB regulations, could subject us to enforcement actions or litigation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations. Our Bank is also subject to the CRA, and periodic CRA examinations by the OCC. The CRA requires us to serve our entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our CRA ratings could be adversely affected by actual or alleged violations of the fair lending or consumer financial protection laws. Even though we have maintained an \u201coutstanding\u201d CRA rating since 2000, we cannot predict our future CRA ratings. Violations of fair lending laws or if our CRA rating falls to less than \u201csatisfactory\u201d could adversely affect our business, including expansion through branching or acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nA limited market exists for the Company\u2019s shares of Class B common stock.\nAlthough since we became a publicly traded company our shares of Class B common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, there has been and there currently is a limited market for shares of Class B common stock and there is no assurance that an active market will develop or be sustained. In addition, on December 23, 2020, we completed a tender offer for shares of our shares of Class B common stock and purchased 4,249,785 shares of Class B common stock, representing approximately 32% of the shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of November 12, 2020. Since the completion of the tender offer, the trading volumes of our shares of Class B common stock has remain limited. If more active trading markets do not develop, you may be unable to sell or purchase shares of our Class B common stock at the volume, price and time that you desire.\nWhether or not the purchase or sale prices of our shares of Class B common stock reflect a reasonable valuation of our shares of Class B common stock may depend on an active trading market developing, and thus the price you receive for our shares of Class B common stock, may not reflect its true or intrinsic value. Limited trading in our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our shares of Class B common stock to be exaggerated from time to time, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market.\nHolders of shares of Class B common stock have limited voting rights. As a result, holders of shares of Class B common stock will have limited ability to influence shareholder decisions.\nGenerally, holders of our shares of Class B common stock are entitled to one-tenth of a vote, and vote together with holders of our shares of Class A common stock on a combined basis, on the ratification of the appointment of our auditors for a given fiscal year, if we present such a proposal for shareholder consideration. Our shares of Class B common stock has no other voting rights, except as required by the Florida Business Corporation Act to vote as a voting group on any amendment, alteration or repeal of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, including any such events as a result of a merger, consolidation or otherwise that significantly and adversely affects the rights or voting powers of our shares of Class B common stock. As a result, virtually all matters submitted to our shareholders will be decided by the vote of holders of our shares of Class A common stock and the market price of our shares of Class B common stock could be adversely affected.\nCertain of our existing shareholders could exert significant control over the Company.\nAs of March 5, 2021, our executive officers, directors and certain greater than 5% holders of our Class A common stock beneficially owns outstanding shares representing, in the aggregate, approximately 21% of the outstanding shares of our voting Class A common stock (without giving effect to the broad family holdings of the Marturet and Vollmer families which will bring the percentage to an aggregate of approximately 33%.) As a result, these shareholders, if they act individually or together, may exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders and, accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements which we might not otherwise consider or prevent us from adopting actions that we might otherwise implement. This concentration of ownership of the Company\u2019s shares of Class A common stock may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or other transaction resulting in a change in control of the Company even when other shareholders may consider the transaction beneficial, and might adversely affect the market price of our shares of Class A and Class B common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few securities or industry analysts cover us, the trading price for our common stock may be adversely affected. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, or downgrades our common stock, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nThe stock price of financial institutions, like Amerant, may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our Company shares will continue to trade. You should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky. The trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations and may be subject to fluctuations in the future. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant variations in response to, among other things, the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022the success or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022quarterly or annual earnings and earnings expectations for our industry, and for us;\n\u2022our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022changes in tax laws;\n\u2022changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022investor perceptions of the Company and the banking industry;\n\u2022our profile, dividend policy or market capitalization may not fit the investment objectives of a large number of shareholders, many of whom are Venezuelans who became shareholders as a result of the Spin-off;\n\u2022events affecting our shareholders in Venezuela, including hyperinflation and currency controls;\n\u2022the intent of our shareholders, including institutional investors, to hold or sell their Company Shares;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock markets or in the values of financial institution stocks, generally;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations, including banking laws and regulations, affecting our business; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company or industry. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, including recessions, loss of investor confidence, and interest rate changes, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding Company Shares.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests. In addition, we are authorized to issue up to 400 million shares of our Class A common stock and up to 100 million shares of our Class B common stock. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, up to 50 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, which may give other shareholders dividend, conversion, voting, and liquidation rights, among other rights, that may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, except as required by law or the Nasdaq Global Select Market, securities convertible into either common stock or preferred stock. Furthermore, we have adopted an equity compensation program for our employees, which also could result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests.\nIn addition, Federal Reserve policy requires bank holding companies\u2019 capital to be comprised predominantly of voting common stock. Class B common stock is non-voting common stock for Federal Reserve purposes, therefore, we expect future issuances of Company Shares will be Class A common stock. These new issuances of Class A common stock, as well as their voting rights, may dilute the interests of our Class A shareholders, and increase the market for, and liquidity of, our Class A common stock generally, as compared to the market for, and liquidity of, our Class B common stock.\nOur dual classes of Company Shares may limit investments by investors using index-based strategies.\nCertain major providers of securities indices have determined to exclude shares of companies with classes of common stock with different voting rights. These actions may limit investment in Company Shares by mutual funds, exchange traded funds, or ETFs, and other investors basing their strategies on such securities indices, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of Company Shares.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth or improve our costs and capital structure. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the performance of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Our common stock could decline or increase in value.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, Florida law, and U.S. banking laws could have anti-takeover effects.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Florida law, and the BHC Act, and Change in Bank Control Act, could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include certain provisions that could delay a takeover or change in control of us, including: the exclusive right of our board to fill any director vacancy; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations; provisions limiting the shareholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings of shareholders or to take action by written consent; and the ability of our board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could be used, among other things, to institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board.\nThe Florida Business Corporation Act contains a control-share acquisition statute that provides that a person who acquires shares in an \u201cissuing public corporation,\u201d as defined in the statute, in excess of certain specified thresholds generally will not have any voting rights with respect to such shares, unless such voting rights are approved by the holders of a majority of the votes of each class of securities entitled to vote separately, excluding shares held or controlled by the acquiring person. Furthermore, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act impose notice, application and approvals and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of bank holding companies, such as ourselves.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are afforded to emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we intend to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock prices may become more volatile. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key people to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. We compete with other financial services companies for people primarily on the basis of compensation, benefits, the strength of the Company and the ability of the candidate to grow within the Company. Intense competition exists for key employees with demonstrated ability, and we may be unable to hire or retain such employees, including those needed to implement our business strategy. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel and failure to effectively transfer knowledge and smooth transitions involving key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business due to loss of their skills, knowledge of our business, their years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of timely finding qualified replacement employees. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified people to fill open key positions or replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. Rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements into which we may enter with certain of our employees and officers. Our regulators may also restrict compensation through rules and practices intended to avoid risks. These restrictions could negatively affect our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting and retaining key personnel.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, global pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, theft, civil unrest, government expropriation or other external events could have significant effects on our business.\nSevere weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods, acts of war or terrorism, epidemics and global pandemics (such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19), theft, civil unrest, government expropriation, condemnation or other external events in the markets where we operate or where our customers live (including Venezuela, which is experiencing a depreciated currency and hyperinflation) could have a significant effect on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, impair employee productivity, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery and business continuity policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business is mainly concentrated in three markets-South Florida, the greater Houston, Texas area and the greater New York City area, which may increase our risks from extreme weather.", "PERMNO": 18050, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AMTB"}
