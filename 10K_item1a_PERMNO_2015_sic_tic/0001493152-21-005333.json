{"cik": "1729944", "company": "IMAC Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth at the beginning of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d you should consider that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. These risk factors may not identify all risks that we face and our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Company, Business and Industry\nWe recorded a net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and there can be no assurance that our future operations will result in net income.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had net revenue of approximately $12,835,200 and $15,126,000, respectively, and we had net loss of approximately $5,003,700 and $6,497,200, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $7,813,200 and an accumulated deficit of approximately $15,045,800. At December 31, 2019, we had stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $7,937,300 and an accumulated deficit of approximately $10,042,100. There can be no assurance that our future operations will result in net income. Our failure to increase our revenues or improve our gross margins will harm our business. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate, our gross margins fail to improve or our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our operating results will suffer. The fee we charge for our management services may decrease, which would reduce our revenues and harm our business. If we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs, or if we fail to develop and introduce new services on a timely basis and services from which we can derive additional revenues, our financial results will suffer.\nWe are in an early stage of development and have a limited operating history upon which to base an estimate of our future performance.\nOur current business was formally organized in March 2015 and we currently have 16 outpatient clinics primarily opened since 2017. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history on which to base an estimate of our future performance. Because we lack a long operating history, you do not have either the type or amount of information that would be available to a purchaser of securities of a company with a more substantial operating history. Our growth and expansion strategy is in the early stages of implementation and there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our strategy or that we will be commercially successful. Our ability to continue as a growing concern is contingent upon our ability to:\n\u25cf raise sufficient capital through debt and equity raises;\n\u25cf hire and retain a number of highly skilled employees, including medical and chiropractic doctors, physical therapists and other practitioners;\n\u25cf lease and develop acceptable premises for our IMAC Regeneration Centers;\n\u25cf build a consistent patient base within the areas of our medical clinics;\n\u25cf secure and maintain arrangements with third-party payers, sports celebrity endorsers and other service providers, all on terms favorable or acceptable to our company;\n\u25cf implement the other numerous necessary portions of our growth and expansion strategy; and\n\u25cf attain profitable operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of the above objectives.\nFurther, because of our small size and limited operating history, our company is particularly susceptible to adverse effects from changes in the law, economic conditions, consumer tastes, competition and other contingencies or events beyond our control. It may be more difficult for us to prepare for and respond to these types of risks than it would be for a company with an established business and operating cash flow. Due to changing circumstances or an inability to implement any portion of our growth and expansion strategy, we may be forced to change dramatically our planned operations.\nWe have suffered a disruption of the operation of our business as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus in the United States. Closures due to government orders or guidance and other related effects of the coronavirus pandemic may cause a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn March 2020, federal, state and local government authorities issued orders and guidance in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. These actions have required or encouraged our patients to remain at home except for essential activities and may reduce patient visits to our clinics. For example, the governor of Kentucky ordered all chiropractic facilities in the state of Kentucky to close effective March 20, 2020, which caused us to close our Kentucky chiropractic facilities until such order is lifted. The full extent and duration of such actions and their impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken.\nThe coronavirus pandemic appears likely to cause significant economic harm across the United States, and the negative economic conditions that may result in reduced patient demand in our industry. We may experience a material loss of patients and revenue as a result of the suspension of any operations. Initiatives to implement telehealth engagement with patients may not be adopted by existing and new patients. Patient habits may also be altered in the medium to long term. Negative economic conditions, a decrease in our revenue and consequent longer term trends harmful to our business may all exert pressure on our company during the pendency of emergency restrictions on our operations and beyond. Due to such conditions, we terminated the employment of 11% of our employees on March 20, 2020, to reduce costs associated with non-essential personnel.\nWe cannot predict with certainty when public health and economic conditions will return to normal. A decline in patient visits and/or the possible suspension of operations mandated in response to the coronavirus, and the consequent loss of revenue and cash flow during this period may make it difficult for us to obtain capital necessary to fund our operations.\nWe may fail completely to implement key elements of our growth and expansion strategy, which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nIf we cannot implement one or more key elements of our growth and expansion strategy, including raising sufficient capital, hiring and retaining qualified staff, leasing and developing acceptable premises for our medical clinics, securing necessary service contracts on favorable or adequate terms, generating sufficient revenue and achieving numerous other objectives, our projected financial performance may be materially adversely affected. Even if all of the key elements of our growth and expansion strategy are successfully implemented, we may not achieve the favorable results, operations and financial performance that we anticipate.\nThe development and operation of our medical clinics will require additional capital, and we may not be able to obtain additional capital on favorable or even acceptable terms. We may also have to incur additional debt, which may adversely affect our liquidity and operating performance.\nOur ability to successfully grow our business and implement our growth and expansion strategy depends in large part on the availability of adequate capital to finance operations. We can give no assurance that we will continue to have sufficient capital to support the continued operations of our company. Changes in our growth and expansion strategy, lower than anticipated revenue for the medical clinics, unanticipated and/or uncontrollable events in the credit or equity markets, changes to our liquidity, increased expenses, and other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing. Financing may not be available on favorable or acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nAdditional equity financing may result in a dilution of the pro rata ownership stake of our stockholders. Further, we may be required to offer subsequent investors investment terms, such as preferred distributions and voting rights, that are superior to the rights of existing stockholders, which could have an adverse effect on the value of the investment of our existing stockholders.\nAdditional debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations, covenants and financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business, and would cause us to incur additional interest expense and financing costs. As a consequence, our operating performance may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a holding company ownership structure and will depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations. Contractual or legal restrictions applicable to our subsidiaries or controlled companies could limit payments or distributions from them.\nWe are a holding company and derive all of our operating income from, and hold substantially all of our assets through, our subsidiaries. The effect of this structure is that we will depend on the earnings of our subsidiaries, and the payment or other distributions to us of these earnings, to meet our obligations. Provisions of law, like those requiring that dividends be paid only out of surplus, and provisions of any future indebtedness, may limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us. Our subsidiaries also control and manage the non-professional aspects of certain other professional service corporations under management services agreements, which could (although they do not currently) contain contractual restrictions on a professional service corporation\u2019s ability to pay service fees to us. The assets of these professional service corporations are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of any of our subsidiaries, creditors of that subsidiary (including trade creditors) will generally be entitled to payment from the assets of that subsidiary before those assets can be distributed to us.\nWe incur substantial start-up expenses for our medical clinics and do not expect to make a profit at any clinic until at least six months after opening each medical clinic.\nWe will incur substantial expenses to implement our growth and expansion strategy, including costs for leasing and developing the premises for each medical clinic, purchasing medical and office equipment, purchasing medical supplies and inventory, marketing and advertising, recruiting and hiring staff, and other expenses. We estimate that it will take at least $700,000 to open each clinic, with an additional $300,000 of operating capital and $200,000 credit line needed to purchase equipment and fund operating losses during the first six months of operation. These start-up costs may increase if there are any delays, problems or other events not currently anticipated. Although we expect each medical clinic to become profitable approximately six months after opening based on our experience with opening the Ozzie Smith Centers in Chesterfield, Missouri in May 2016 and in St. Peters, Missouri in August 2017, and the IMAC Regeneration Center in Murray, Kentucky in February 2017, no guarantee can be made that any of the clinics or our company overall will operate profitably. By way of example, the David Price Center in Brentwood, Tennessee, which opened in May 2017, initially experienced unforeseen delays in staffing, construction and marketing launch. If we do not reach profitability and recover our start-up expenses and other accumulated operating losses, stockholders will likely suffer a significant decline in the value of their investment.\nWe may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, which could materially adversely affect our operations and ability to successfully implement our growth and expansion strategy.\nOur growth and expansion strategy relies on obtaining sufficient financing, including one or more equipment lines to purchase medical and office equipment and one or more lines of credit for operating and related expenses. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or in the amount anticipated by our growth and expansion strategy. If unable to secure the amount of financing anticipated by our growth and expansion strategy, we may be unable to implement one or more portions of our growth and expansion strategy. If we accept less favorable terms for our financing than anticipated, we may incur additional expenses and restrictions on operations and may be less liquid and less profitable than expected. Should either of these events occur, we could suffer material adverse effects to our ability to implement our growth and expansion strategy and operate successfully.\nWe may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financing, government or third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the stockholders. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock. In addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matter, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and the pursue business opportunities.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our efforts, our ability to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and we could be forced to halt operations. Accordingly, our business may fail, in which case you would lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit opinion for the year ended December 31, 2020 a statement that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of continued losses and financial condition at December 31, 2020, unless we are able to obtain additional financing, enter into strategic alliances or sell assets. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our auditors, our current lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or enter into strategic alliances. If we become unable to obtain additional capital and to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\nWe plan to incur indebtedness to implement our growth and expansion strategy and, as a consequence, may be unprofitable and unsuccessful in achieving our financial and operating goals.\nWe plan to finance some of our start-up and operating costs through debt leveraging, including one or more equipment lines and one or more lines of credit. This debt could adversely affect our financial performance and ability to:\n\u25cf implement our growth and expansion strategy;\n\u25cf recoup start-up costs;\n\u25cf operate profitably;\n\u25cf maintain acceptable levels of liquidity;\n\u25cf obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, development and other general business purposes;\n\u25cf obtain additional financing on favorable terms; and\n\u25cf compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.\nWe will manage, but will not own, certain of the medical clinics or employ the medical service providers who will treat patients at the clinics.\nSeveral of our medical clinics will be owned exclusively by a professional service corporation in order to comply with state laws regulating the ownership of medical practices. We will, in turn, through a contractual arrangement, provide long-term, exclusive management services to those professional service corporations and their medical professionals. All employees who provide direct medical services to patients will be employed by the professional service corporation. These management services agreements protect us from certain liability and provide a structured engagement to deliver non-medical, comprehensive management and administrative services to help the medical professionals operate the business. The management services agreements authorize us to act on behalf of the professional service corporation, but do not authorize the professional service corporations to act on our behalf or enter into contracts with third parties on our behalf. We will employ the non-medical provider staff for the clinics and provide comprehensive management and administrative services to help the professional service corporation operate the clinics. We may also loan money to the professional service corporation for certain payroll and development costs, although we have no obligation to do so. This arrangement makes our financial and operational success highly dependent on the professional service corporation. Under our management service agreements, we provide exclusive comprehensive management and related administrative services to the professional service corporation and receive management fees. Due to this financial and operational control by contract, our financial statements consolidate the financial results of the professional service corporations. However, we will have little, if any, tangible assets as to those operations. These characteristics increase the risk associated with an investment in our company.\nOur management services agreements may be terminated.\nThe management services agreements we have with several of our clinics may be terminated by mutual agreement of us and the applicable clinic, by a non-breaching party after 30 days following an uncured breach by the other party, upon a bankruptcy of either party or by us upon 90 days\u2019 prior written notice to the clinic. The termination of a management services agreement would result in the termination of payment of management fees from the applicable clinic, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe do not control the delivery of medical care at any of our facilities.\nWe have no direct control over the medical care in any of our facilities. State medical boards govern the licensing and delivery of medical care within a state. For this reason, the medical practitioners are solely responsible for making medical decisions with their abilities and experience. We run the risk of being associated with a medical practitioner that performs poorly or does not comply with medical board legislation. When we are responsible for the recruitment or staffing of medical professionals, we may hire a professional that delivers care outside of medical protocols. Our inability to exercise control over the medical care and managed centers increases the risks associated with an investment in our company.\nState medical boards may amend licensing requirements for medical service providers, service delivery oversight for midlevel practitioners, and ownership or location requirements for the delivery of medical treatments.\nWe have no direct control over the medical care in any of our facilities. State medical boards govern the licensing and delivery of medical care within a state. Each state medical board controls the level of licensing required for each medical practitioner and the requirements to obtain such a license to deliver medical care. Furthermore, the state medical board typically determines the required practitioner oversight for medical practitioners based on their license achieved, earned degrees and continuing education. The current requirements for these practitioners may change in the future and we run the risk of additional expenses necessary to meet the state medical board requirements. The state medical board may also determine the location in which services are delivered. We risk the loss of revenue or retrofitting expense if the state medical board amends location requirements for the delivery of certain treatments. Similarly, state medical boards may amend ownership or management requirements for the operation of medical clinics within their respective state. The board may also investigate or dispute the legal establishment of owned or managed medical clinics. We risk a material loss of ownership of or management control and subsequent fee from medical clinics that are in our possession or control.\nAdverse medical outcomes are possible with conservative and minimally invasive treatments.\nMedical practitioners performing services at our IMAC facilities run the risk of delivering treatments for which the patient may experience a poor outcome. This is possible with non-invasive and minimally invasive services alike, including the use of autologous treatments in which a patient\u2019s own cells are used to regenerate damaged tissues. At our IMAC Regeneration Centers, a minimally invasive treatment involves puncturing the skin with a needle or a minor incision which could lead to infection, bleeding, pain, nausea, or other similar results. Non-invasive and conservative physical medicine treatments may possibly cause soft tissue tears, contusions, heart conditions, stroke, and other physically straining conditions. The treatments or potential clinical research studies may yield further patient risks. An adverse outcome may include but not be limited to a loss of feeling, chronic pain, long-term disability, or death. We have obtained medical malpractice coverage in the event an adverse outcome occurs. However, the insurance limits may be exceeded or liability outside of the coverage may adversely impact the financial performance of the business, including any potential negative media coverage on patient volume.\nPotential conflicts of interest exist with respect to the management services agreement that we have entered into concerning our clinics in Kentucky, and it is possible our interests and the affiliated owners of those clinics may diverge.\nOur medical clinics in Kentucky are held by a professional service corporation that is owned by Matthew C. Wallis, DC, our Chief Operating Officer, a director and co-founder of our company, and Jason Brame, DC, a co-founding member of our company, in order to comply with the state\u2019s laws regulating the ownership of medical practices. The professional service corporation directs the provision of medical services to patients and employs the physicians and registered nurses at the clinics, we do not. Rather, pursuant to the terms of a long-term, exclusive management services agreement, we employ the non-medical provider staff for the clinics and provide comprehensive management and administrative services to help the professional service corporation operate the clinics. We believe that the service fees and other terms of our management services agreement are standard in the outpatient healthcare practice area. Nonetheless, the management services agreement presents the possibility of a conflict of interest in the event that issues arise with regard to the respective medical and non-medical services being provided at the clinics, including quality of care issues of which we become aware and billing and collection matters that we handle on behalf of the physician practices, where our interests may diverge from those of Drs. Wallis and Brame acting on behalf of the professional service corporation. No such issues, however, have occurred during this arrangement.\nThe management services agreement provides that we will have the right to control the daily operations of the medical clinics subject, in the case of practicing medicine, to the direction of Drs. Wallis and Brame acting on behalf of the professional service corporation. Our interests with respect to such direction may be at odds with those of Drs. Wallis and Brame, requiring them to recuse themselves from our decisions relating to such matters, or even from further involvement with our company.\nWe comply with applicable state law with respect to transactions (including business opportunities and management services agreements) involving potential conflicts. Applicable state corporate law requires that all transactions involving our company and any director or executive officer (or other entities with which they are affiliated) are subject to full disclosure and approval of the majority of the disinterested independent members of our Board of Directors, approval of the majority of our stockholders or the determination that the contract or transaction is intrinsically fair to us. More particularly, our policy is to have any related party transactions (i.e., transactions involving a director, an officer or an affiliate of our company) be approved solely by a majority of the disinterested independent directors serving on the Board of Directors.\nDrs. Wallis and Brame are significant holders of our outstanding shares of common stock and we anticipate they will continue to own a significant percentage of our outstanding shares. Dr. Wallis founded our original IMAC medical clinic in Paducah, Kentucky in August 2000 and, with Jeffrey S. Ervin, our Chief Executive Officer, founded our current company in March 2015. Dr. Wallis, working with Mr. Ervin, will be substantially responsible for selecting the business direction we take, the medical clinics we open in the future and the services we may provide. The management services agreement may present Drs. Wallis and Brame with conflicts of interest.\nThe loss of the services of Jeffrey S. Ervin or Matthew C. Wallis, DC for any reason would materially and adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur financial success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of Jeffrey S. Ervin, our Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew C. Wallis, DC, our Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Ervin, who has unique knowledge regarding the roll-out of our IMAC Regeneration Centers, and Dr. Wallis, who has extensive business contacts, would be extremely difficult to replace. We have entered into employment arrangements with Mr. Ervin and Dr. Wallis, however there can be no assurance that Mr. Ervin or Dr. Wallis will continue to provide services to us. A voluntary or involuntary departure by either executive could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract a qualified replacement for him in a timely manner. We do not have a key-man life insurance policy for our benefit on the life of either Mr. Ervin or Dr. Wallis.\nWe may fail to obtain the business licenses and any other licenses necessary to operate our medical clinics, or the necessary engineering, building, occupancy and other permits to develop the premises for the clinics, which would materially adversely affect our growth and expansion strategy.\nIf we cannot obtain approval for business licenses or any other licenses necessary to operate our medical clinics, it could materially adversely affect our growth and expansion strategy and could result in a failure to implement our growth and expansion strategy. Failure to obtain the necessary engineering, building, occupancy and other permits from applicable governmental authorities to develop the premises for our medical clinics could also materially adversely affect our growth and expansion strategy and could result in a failure to implement our growth and expansion strategy.\nWe may face strong competition from other providers in our primary service areas, and increased competition from new competitors, which may hinder our ability to obtain and retain customers.\nWe will be in competition with other more established companies using a variety of treatments for the conditions and ailments that our services are intended to treat, including orthopedic surgeons, pain management clinics, hospital systems and outpatient surgery centers providing joint reconstruction and related surgeries. These companies may be better capitalized and have more established name recognition than us. We may face additional competition in the future if other providers enter our primary service areas. Competition from existing providers and providers that may begin competing with us in the future could materially adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nFurther, the services provided by our company are relatively new and unique. We cannot be certain that our services will achieve or sustain market acceptance, or that a sufficient volume of patients in the Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Illinois areas will utilize our services. We will be in competition with alternative treatment methods, including those presently existing and those that may develop in the future. As such, our growth and expansion strategy carries many unknown factors that subject us and our investors to a high degree of uncertainty and risk.\nWe are competing in a dynamic market with risk of technological change.\nThe market for medical, physical therapy and chiropractic services is characterized by frequent technological developments and innovations, new product and service introductions, and evolving industry standards. The dynamic character of these products and services will require us to effectively use leading and new technologies, develop our expertise and reputation, enhance our current service offerings and continue to improve the effectiveness, feasibility and consistency of our services. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in responding quickly, cost-effectively and sufficiently to these and other such developments.\nOur success will depend largely upon general economic conditions and consumer acceptance in our primary service areas.\nOur current primary service areas are located in certain geographical areas in the states of Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Illinois and Florida. Our operations and profitability could be adversely affected by a local economic downturn, changes in local consumer acceptance of our approach to healthcare, and discretionary spending power, and other unforeseen or unexpected changes within those areas.\nWe are required to comply with numerous government laws and regulations, which could change, increasing costs and adversely affecting our financial performance and operations.\nMedical and chiropractic service providers are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation, including but not limited to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and other government entities. We are subject to regulation by these entities as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. Such regulations may be changed from time to time, or new regulations adopted, which could result in additional or unexpected costs of compliance.\nChanges to national health insurance policy and third-party insurance carrier fee schedules for traditional medical treatments could decrease patient revenue and adversely affect our financial performance and operations.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting medical and chiropractic service providers, health insurance providers and other participants in the healthcare industry in the United States to potential fundamental changes. Potential changes to nationwide health insurance policy are currently being debated. We cannot predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state healthcare reform or private sector insurance reform may have on our business.\nWe receive payment for the services we render to patients from their private health insurance providers and from Medicare and Medicaid. If third-party payers change the expected fee schedule (the amount paid by such payers for services rendered by us), we could experience a loss of revenue, which could adversely affect financial performance.\nAt the present time, most private health insurance providers do not cover the regenerative medical treatments provided at our medical clinics. However, traditional physical medical treatments provided at our medical clinics, such as physical therapy, chiropractic services and medical evaluations, are covered by most health insurance providers. Medicare and Medicaid take the same position as private insurers and reimburse patients for traditional physical medical treatments but not for regenerative medical treatments. If private health insurance providers and Medicare and Medicaid were to begin covering regenerative medical treatments, the revenue we would receive on a per-treatment basis would likely decline given their tighter fee schedules. Further, such a change might result in increased competition as additional healthcare providers begin offering our customized services.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes relating to the IMAC Regeneration Center brand name.\nWe are a holding company in which our medical clinics are formed in separate subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are currently operating in Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Illinois and Florida. As a consequence of this entity structure, any adverse change to the brand, reputation, financial performance or other aspects of the IMAC Regeneration Center brand at any one location could adversely affect the operations and financial performance of the entire company.\nWe will depend heavily on the efforts of our key personnel, as well as sports celebrity endorsers.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities of our officers and key employees, including medical and chiropractic doctors and other practitioners, and our sports celebrity endorsers. Loss or abatement of the services of any of these persons, or any adverse change to the sports celebrity endorsers, could have a material adverse effect on us and our business, operations and financial performance.\nOur success also will depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and motivate highly skilled managerial personnel, medical doctors, chiropractors, licensed physical therapists, and other practitioners. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, the quality, philosophy and performance of key personnel could adversely affect our operations and performance.\nWe may incur losses that are not covered by insurance.\nWe maintain insurance policies against professional liability, general commercial liability and other potential losses of our company. All of the regenerative, medical, physical therapy and chiropractic treatments performed at our clinics are covered by our malpractice insurance; however, there is an upper limit to the payout allowable in the event of our malpractice. Poor patient outcomes for healthcare providers may result in legal actions and/or settlements outside of the scope of our malpractice insurance coverage. Regenerative medicine represents approximately 2% of our patient visits and 20% of our revenue. Future innovations in regenerative medicine may require review or approval of such innovations by governmental regulators. During formal research studies performed in collaboration with regulators, we may be required to obtain new insurance policies and there is no assurance that insurance policy underwriters will provide coverage for such research initiatives. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, our financial performance and operation could suffer material adverse effects.\nWe are susceptible to risks relating to investigation or audit by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), health insurance providers and the IRS.\nWe may be audited by CMS or any health insurance provider that pays us for services provided to patients. Any such audit may result in reclaimed payments, which would decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial performance. Our federal tax returns may be audited by the IRS and our state tax returns may be audited by applicable state government authorities. Any such audit may result in the challenge and disallowance of some of our deductions or an increase in our taxable income. No assurance can be made with regard to the deductibility of certain tax items or the position taken by us on our tax returns. Further, an audit or any litigation resulting from an audit could unexpectedly increase our expenses and adversely affect financial performance and operations.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has pursued bad actors in the regenerative medicine therapy industry, and we could be included in any broad investigation.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has pursued bad actors in the regenerative medicine therapy industry. Since we provide regenerative medicine treatments, we may be subject to broad investigations from the FDA or state medical boards regarding the marketing and medical delivery of our treatments. In November 2017, we engaged a medical consulting group to advise us on current protocols in this area and to organize a clinical trial towards an investigational new drug application with the FDA, while pursuing a voluntary regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation under Section 3033 of the 21st Century Cures Act.\nAny significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our patients and users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm these systems. Interruptions in these systems, or to the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or impair our ability to deliver content to our customers. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our services to existing and potential patients. In addition, during the second half of 2019, we began the implementation of an updated medical and financial platform in our clinics.\nOur servers and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions and periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. Any attempt by hackers to disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and, to date, hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems. However, this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of patients and adversely affect our business and results of operation.\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party data center. In addition, we utilize third-party internet-based or \u201ccloud\u201d computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize third-party content delivery networks to help us stream content to our patients and other parties over the internet. Problems faced by us or our service providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, could adversely impact the experience of our audiences and users.\nDuring the normal course of business, we may choose to pursue services with a different third-party vendor or pursue a change in systems which could result in interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse, or theft of data. We have implemented systems and processes to mitigate these risks and, to date, have not experienced a material impact on our services or systems due to change in systems or third-party. However, this is no assurance that a change in systems or services used by us or a change in third-party vendors may not have a material impact in the future. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of patients and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur reputation and relationships with patients would be harmed if our patients\u2019 data, particularly personally identifying data, were to be subject to a cyber-attack or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons.\nWe maintain personal data regarding our patients, including their names and other information. With respect to personally identifying data, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We also take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our patients\u2019 data. Despite these measures, we could experience, though we have not to date experienced, a cyber-attack or other unauthorized intrusion into our patients\u2019 data. Our security measures could also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or otherwise. In the event our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that impair or deny the ability of patients to access our services, current and potential patients may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary for them to become users of our services or may curtail or stop using our services. In addition, we could face legal claims for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material and exceed the limits of the insurance we maintain against the risks of a data breach. For these reasons, should an unauthorized intrusion into our patients\u2019 data occur, our business could be adversely affected. Changes to operating rules could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our previously filed consolidated financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a significant negative effect on our reported results and retrospectively affect previously reported results, which, in turn, could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over our financial reporting.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses relate to the absence of in-house accounting personnel with the ability to properly account for complex transactions and a lack of separation of duties between accounting and other functions.\nWe hired a consulting firm to advise on technical issues related to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as related to the maintenance of our accounting books and records and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Although we are aware of the risks associated with not having dedicated accounting personnel, we are also at an early stage in the development of our business. We anticipate expanding our accounting functions with dedicated staff and improving our internal accounting procedures and separation of duties when we can absorb the costs of such expansion and improvement with additional capital resources. In the meantime, management will continue to observe and assess our internal accounting function and make necessary improvements whenever they may be required. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our consolidated financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nAs a public reporting company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company, we:\n\u25cf are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as \u201ccompensation discussion and analysis\u201d);\n\u25cf are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden-parachute\u201d votes);\n\u25cf are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure;\n\u25cf may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A; and\n\u25cf are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our consolidated financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis, are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure, and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Under current SEC rules, however, we will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Warrants\nOur stock price is volatile and an investment could decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuates substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. During the 52-week period prior to the filing of this Annual Report, the market price of our common stock ranged from a low of $0.42 per share to a high of $4.95 per share, and as of February 28, 2021, was $2.08 per share. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of the value of your investment in our common stock and/or warrants. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf publication of research reports about us or the outpatient medical clinic business;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u25cf announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u25cf changes affecting the availability of financing in the outpatient medical services market;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the outpatient medical clinic business;\n\u25cf significant future sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf the realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this prospectus; and\n\u25cf general economic, market and currency factors and conditions unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies. These broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf our stock price falls below $1.00 per share, our common stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nIf the bid price of our common stock were to close below the required minimum $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we may receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq regarding our failure to comply with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). If we receive such a notice, pursuant to Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we may become subject to a period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2). If at any time the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2). We received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq in October 2020 when our stock price was below $1.00 for 30 consecutive days and subsequently received notice that we had regained compliance in November 2020. In the event we do not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) prior to the expiration of any Nasdaq compliance period, Nasdaq may notify us that our common stock is subject to delisting. We may appeal such a delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearing panel and the delisting may be stayed pending the panel\u2019s determination. At such hearing, we would present a plan to regain compliance and Nasdaq would then subsequently render a decision. We are currently evaluating our alternatives to resolve any listing deficiency. To the extent that we are unable to resolve a listing deficiency, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock and potentially result in even lower bid prices for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, or if our actual results differ significantly from our guidance, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may release earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. Any failure to meet guidance or analysts\u2019 expectations could have a material adverse effect on the trading price or volume of our stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur corporate documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders. These provisions:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to help defend against a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf provide that stockholders are only entitled to call a special meeting upon written request by 331/3% of the outstanding common stock; and\n\u25cf require supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nIn addition, Delaware law prohibits large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances. These provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nWe have 5,000,000 authorized unissued shares of preferred stock, and our board has the ability to designate the rights and preferences of this preferred stock without your vote.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of these shares, without further stockholder approval. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. As indicated in the preceding risk factor, the ability to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the voting stock of our company thereby discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. We currently have no outstanding shares of preferred stock, or plans to issue any such shares in the future.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers and directors may limit our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nJeffrey S. Ervin, our Chief Executive Officer, Matthew C. Wallis, DC, our Chief Operating Officer, and our other executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our outstanding shares. These persons, acting together, are able to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our operating results, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends, and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.", "PERMNO": 18405, "SIC": 8093, "TIC": "IMAC"}
