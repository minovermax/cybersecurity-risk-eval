{"cik": "1498301", "company": "Ascena Retail Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our operational results, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading prices of our securities, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. We may also be adversely affected by additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict fashion trends and customer preferences.\nFashion apparel trends and customer preferences are volatile and tend to change rapidly, particularly for women and tween girls. Our success depends largely on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores, which in turn could adversely affect our business and our image with our customers. Because we enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand, price shifting, and the optimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. If we miscalculate either the demand for our merchandise or our customers\u2019 tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below average markups over cost, or below cost, which would have an adverse effect on our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nIn connection with the ANN Acquisition, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and assumed certain of ANN\u2019s liabilities, which could adversely affect us.\nWe substantially increased our indebtedness in connection with the completion of the ANN Acquisition, which could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense. We also incurred various costs and expenses associated with our financings. The amount of cash flows required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels resulting from the ANN Acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the transaction. The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nThe indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nIn addition, our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. In connection with the debt financing, we received ratings from S&P and Moody\u2019s. There can be no assurance that we will maintain particular ratings in the future.\nMoreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nTo service our indebtedness after the ANN Acquisition, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nAs a result of the ANN Acquisition, our ability to make cash payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness as well as our ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future, which is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that will be beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The instruments governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to sell assets and our use of the proceeds from such sales.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and the lenders under the term facility, the revolving facility and other indebtedness, or any replacement facilities in respect thereof, could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against the Company\u2019s assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nInability to access liquidity or capital markets could adversely affect the Company's business, operational results, financial position, or cash flows.\nChanges in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Company\u2019s access to potential sources of future liquidity. As a result of occasional instability in the global financial markets, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. Although we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations, and available borrowings under our $600 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future, any renewed tightening of the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, enter into an agreement for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities.\nIn addition, we also have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit at FDIC-insured financial institutions that are currently in excess of federally-insured limits. As a result, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses with respect to cash on deposit in excess of federally-insured limits.\nOur ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions.\nThe success of ascena's businesses continues to depend on our ability to integrate and manage our expanding operations, to realize opportunities for revenue growth, and to eliminate redundant and excess costs. Achieving the anticipated benefits of previous and future acquisitions, including the ANN Acquisition, may present a number of significant risks and considerations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nunsuccessful, delayed, or more costly integration;\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to the increase in our size and the loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\n\u2022\nexpected cost savings not being achieved in full, or taking longer or requiring greater investment to achieve; and\n\u2022\nnot achieving the anticipated omni-channel growth potential.\nExisting and increased competition in the women\u2019s and girls' retail apparel industry may reduce our net revenues, profits and market share.\nThe women\u2019s and girls' retail apparel industry is highly competitive. Although the Company is one of the nation\u2019s largest specialty retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local level, primarily consisting of department stores, off-price retailers, other specialty stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, Internet, and mail-order retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, promotional, and other resources than we have. Many department stores offer a broader\nselection of merchandise than we offer. In addition, many department stores continue to be promotional and reduce their selling prices, and in some cases are expanding into markets in which we have a significant presence. As a result of this competition, we may experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur ability to successfully adapt to and implement ongoing organizational change could impact our business results.\nWe have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, workforce and technology optimization projects to support our growth strategies. We expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. Successfully managing these changes is critical to our business success. In addition, our success is dependent on identifying, developing, and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing organizational capabilities in key growth markets, where the depth of skilled employees is limited, and competition for these resources is intense. Further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase compliance risks, including risks related to compliance with anti-corruption laws. Finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. If we are unable to deliver the expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth, our operational results, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on strip shopping center and mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations.\nMany of our stores are located in strip shopping centers, shopping malls and other retail centers that benefit from their proximity to \u201canchor\u201d retail tenants, generally large department stores, and other attractions, which generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Strip shopping center and mall traffic may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns, the closing of anchor stores or changes in customer shopping preferences. A decline in the popularity of strip shopping center or mall shopping among our target customers could have a material adverse effect on customer traffic and our operational results.\nTo take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.\nWe rely on foreign sources of production.\nWe purchase a significant portion of our merchandise directly from foreign markets, including Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources. We face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nfinancial or political instability in any of the countries in which our merchandise is manufactured, or the channels through which it passes;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies;\n\u2022\ninability of our manufacturers to comply with local laws, including labor laws, health and safety laws or labor practices;\n\u2022\nincreased security and regulatory requirements applicable to imported goods;\n\u2022\nimposition or increases of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nimposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our merchandise that may be imported into the United States from countries in regions where we do business;\n\u2022\nimpact of natural disasters and public health concerns on our foreign sourcing offices and vendor manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\ndelays in shipping due to port security considerations or labor disputes;\n\u2022\nregulations under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\nincreased costs of transportation.\nNew initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries. The future performance of our business depends on foreign suppliers, and may be adversely affected by the factors listed above, all of which are beyond our control. The foregoing may result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise or increase our costs.\nWe require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and our internal requirements. Our vendor code of conduct, guidelines, or other compliance programs promote ethical business practices, and we monitor compliance with them; however, we do not control these manufacturers, their labor practices, the health and safety conditions of their facilities,\nor their sources of raw materials. Any violation of labor, health, environmental, safety (e.g., building and fire codes) or other laws by any of the independent manufacturers we use could damage our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny of the aforementioned risks, independently or in combination with others, could have an adverse effect on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer as a result of a third-party manufacturer\u2019s inability to produce goods for us on time and to our specifications.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all of the goods that we sell. Both domestic and international manufacturers produce these goods. The Company is at risk for increases in manufacturing costs, and we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with these third-party manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with merchandise specifications, insufficient quality control, and failure to meet production deadlines. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our safety, quality, and social compliance standards could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any product we sell or if we fail to comply with applicable product safety laws.\nThe products our brands sell are regulated by many different governmental bodies, including but not limited to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., Health Canada in Canada, and similar state, provincial and international regulatory authorities. Although we test the products sold in our brands\u2019 stores and on our brands\u2019 websites, selected products still could present safety problems of which our brands are not aware. This could lead one or more of our brands to recall selected products, either voluntarily or at the direction of a governmental authority, and may lead to a lack of consumer acceptance or loss of consumer trust. Product safety concerns, recalls, defects, or errors could result in the rejection of our products by customers, damage to our reputation, lost sales, product liability litigation, and increased costs, any or all of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operational results, and cash flows.\nThe cost of compliance with current requirements and any future requirements of federal, state or international regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operational results, and cash flows. Examples of these requirements include regulatory testing, certification, packaging, labeling, advertising, and reporting requirements affecting broad categories of consumer products. In addition, any failure of one or more of our brands to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties, require one or more of our brands to recall products, and harm our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nRisks associated with ecommerce sales.\nThe successful operation of our ecommerce business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and continuous operation of our ecommerce websites and our fulfillment operations, and to provide a shopping experience that will generate orders and return visits to our sites. Our ecommerce services are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ncomputer system failures, including but not limited to, inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, change in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migrations, Internet service, or power outages;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party computer hardware/software fulfillment and delivery providers;\n\u2022\nunfavorable federal or state regulations and laws;\n\u2022\nviolations of federal, state or other applicable laws, including those related to online privacy;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in telephone service or power outages;\n\u2022\ncredit card fraud;\n\u2022\nconstantly evolving and changing technology;\n\u2022\nliability for online content;\n\u2022\ndiversion of sales from our stores; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or adverse weather conditions.\nThe Company's failure to successfully address and respond to any one or more of these risks could damage the reputation of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer if our information technology systems fail to operate effectively, are disrupted or compromised.\nWe rely on our existing information technology systems in operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business, including sales, warehousing, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment, and financial systems. The reliability and capacity of our information technology systems (including third-party hardware and software systems or services) are critical to our continued operations. Despite our precautionary efforts, our information technology systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, natural disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, power outages, computer viruses, and security breaches, which may require significant investment to fix or replace, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays to our operations in the interim. While, to our knowledge, we have not experienced any material loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a security breach, or cyber-attack, such an event could adversely affect our business and operations, including our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees, and investors, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, and could impact our operational results, financial position, and cash flows. While we believe that we are diligent in selecting vendors, systems, and services to assist us in maintaining the integrity of our information technology systems, we realize that there are risks and that no guarantee can be made that future disruptions, service outages, service failures or unauthorized intrusions will not occur.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increased expenses to mitigate our exposure.\nOur business and that of our third-party service providers employ systems and websites that allow us to process credit card transactions (containing personally identifiable information, \u201cPII\u201d), perform online ecommerce and social media activities, and store and transmit proprietary or confidential customer, employee, job applicant, and other information. Security and/or privacy breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming, and/or human error or other similar events could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks or intrusions. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by our third-party service providers that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and Company data is critical. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Any breach involving this data could attract negative media attention, cause harm to our reputation or result in liability (including but not limited to fines, penalties or lawsuits), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with credit card fraud and identity theft that would cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenues.\nIn the standard course of business, we process customer information, including payment information, through our stores and ecommerce sites. There is an increased concern over the security of PII transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. We endeavor to protect consumer identity and payment information through the implementation of security technologies, processes, and procedures. It is possible that an individual or group could defeat our security measures and access sensitive consumer information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increased costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Incidents which result in exposure of customer data will be handled in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Exposure of customer data through any means could materially harm the Company by, but not limited to, reputational damage, regulatory fines, and costs of litigation.\nOur business would suffer a material adverse effect if our distribution or fulfillment centers were shut down or disrupted.\nNearly all of the merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution and fulfillment centers in Etna, Ohio or Greencastle, Indiana, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores or to the customer directly. As a result of damage to, or prolonged interruption of, operations at either of these facilities due to a work stoppage, supply chain disruption, weather event such as tornado, flood, blizzard or other natural disaster, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores or customers during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace either of these facilities.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, management cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, if either of the distribution or fulfillment centers is shut down for any unplanned reason.\nOur business could suffer if parties with whom the Company does business are subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.\nThe Company is party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, advertising, software development and support, logistics, and other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in its ordinary course. Adverse economic, industry or market conditions could result in an increased risk to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurance that it would be able to arrange alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers.\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have and thus may have an advantage in the competition for production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of the goods that we sell must be replaced, we may have to increase purchases from our other third-party manufacturers and we cannot guarantee we will be able to do so at all or on terms that are acceptable to us. This may negatively affect our operational results. We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications and other standard industry provisions, but we do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer.\nOur business could suffer if one of the manufacturers of the goods that we sell fails to use acceptable labor practices.\nWe require manufacturers of the goods that we sell to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our staff and our agents periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of local labor, employment or other laws by an independent third-party manufacturer used by us, or the divergence of an independent third-party manufacturer\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of products to us or damage our reputation, which may result in a decrease in customer traffic to our stores or ecommerce websites that could adversely affect our operational results. Publicity regarding violation of the foregoing guidelines or practices or other social/compliance standards by any of our third-party manufacturers could adversely affect our operational results.\nActs of terrorism, effects of war, public health, natural disasters, other catastrophes or political unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe threat, or actual acts, of terrorism continue to be a risk to the global economy. Terrorism and potential military responses, political unrest, natural disasters, pandemics or other health issues have disrupted or could disrupt commerce, impact our ability to operate our stores or offices in the affected areas or impact our ability to provide critical functions or services necessary to the operation of our business. A disruption of commerce, or an inability to recover critical functions or services from such a disruption, could interfere with the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise in a timely manner or increase our costs to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, any of the above disruptions could undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact consumer spending or customer traffic, and thus have an adverse effect on our operational results.\nIf we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers, as merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. In addition, the nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory,\nespecially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers\u2019 preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins.\nWe have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including our seamless inventory and responsive supply chain initiatives. Aspects of seamless inventory include more timely matching of product supply and demand across markets and channels to reduce stranded inventory. Aspects of responsive supply chain include more vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. These initiatives involve significant systems and operational changes and we have limited experience operating in this manner. If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, labor, energy and freight.\nRaw materials used to manufacture our merchandise are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high or low demand for fabrics, labor conditions, transportation or freight costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, supply conditions, economic inflation and other unpredictable factors. Increases in the price of cotton, wool and other raw materials used in the production of fabric and accessories, as well as increases in labor and energy costs, could result in increases for the costs of our products as well as their distribution to our distribution centers, retail locations and to our customers. Additionally, freight costs are impacted by changes in fuel prices. Fuel prices affect freight costs on inbound freight from vendors to the distribution centers, outbound freight from the distribution centers to our stores and shipments directly to our customers. Higher product costs could have a negative effect on our gross profit margin and increased selling prices could have a negative effect on our sales volume.\nWe depend on key personnel in order to support our existing business and future expansion and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nOur success and our ability to execute our business strategy depend largely on the efforts of our current management teams at the Company and the respective brands. Executives at the Company and the brands have substantial experience in the retail business and have made significant contributions to the growth and success of our business. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, as we may not be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense, and our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to attract, hire, motivate and retain qualified personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified individuals.\nOur performance also depends in large part on the talents and contributions of engaged and skilled associates in all areas of the Company. If we are unable to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain talented individuals, we may be unable to compete effectively which could adversely impact our business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nCovenants in our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and our Term Loan contain various covenants that impose restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect their ability to operate their businesses.\nThe Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Loan contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on their property, change the nature of their business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of their assets to any one person. In addition, the agreements that govern the financings contain financial covenants that, under certain circumstances, will require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the Company\u2019s repayment obligations.\nOur business may be affected by regulatory, administrative and litigation developments.\nLaws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from regulatory or administrative changes. Changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, advertising and marketing practices, product safety, transportation and logistics, healthcare,\ntax, accounting, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nIncreases in labor costs, including wages and employee healthcare costs, could impact the Company's operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nThe Company's expenses relating to wages and employee healthcare costs are significant. Unfavorable changes in labor costs could negatively affect the Company's operational results, financial position, and cash flows. Our wage rates may increase in the foreseeable future and are subject to various factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage requirements and economic conditions. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the implementation of the legislation, the Company is not able at this time to fully determine the impact that healthcare reform will have on the Company-sponsored medical plans.\nWe are pursuing a strategy of international expansion.\nWe currently intend to expand our operations into other countries in the future. Currently, our Justice brand has licensed stores in certain Middle Eastern countries, Southeast Asia, Central and South America; both Justice and maurices have retail operations in Canada. As we expand internationally, we may incur significant costs associated with the start-up and maintenance of foreign operations. Costs may include, but are not limited to, obtaining locations for stores, setting up foreign offices, hiring experienced management and maintaining good relations with associates. We may be unable to open and operate new stores successfully, or we may face operational issues that delay our intended pace of international store growth. In any such case, our expansion may be limited, unless we can:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable markets and sites for store locations;\n\u2022\naddress the different operational characteristics present in each country to which we expand, including employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, lease provisions and local reporting or legal requirements;\n\u2022\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms, in some cases in locations in which the relative rights and obligations of landlords and tenants differ significantly from the customs and practices in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain competent store personnel;\n\u2022\ngain and retain acceptance from foreign customers;\n\u2022\nmanage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nexpand infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u2022\nmanage foreign government regulations;\n\u2022\nmanage foreign currency exchange risk effectively; and\n\u2022\nachieve acceptable operating margins from new stores.\nFailure to implement our international expansion plan consistent with our internal expectations, whether as a result of one or more of the factors listed above or other factors, could adversely affect our ability to achieve the objectives that we have established.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we are subject to certain U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as the laws of foreign countries in which we operate. We are required to use reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with these laws. Violations of these laws could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that would have an adverse effect on our reputation, operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe may experience disruptions at ports used to import our products from Asia and other regions.\nWe currently ship the vast majority of our products by ocean. If a disruption occurs in the operation of ports through which our products are imported, we and our vendors may have to ship some or all of our products from Asia or other regions by air freight or to alternative shipping destinations in the United States. Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean and our profitability could be reduced. Similarly, shipping to alternative destinations in the United States could lead to increased lead times and costs for our products. A disruption at ports (domestic or abroad) through which our products are imported could have a material adverse effect on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future tax payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of international and domestic tax\naudits, including uncertain tax positions. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and reserves are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdictions or by changes to existing tax rules or regulations.\nChanges to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nChanges to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our future operational results or cause the perception that we are more highly leveraged. Other new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. For instance, accounting regulatory authorities have indicated that they may begin to require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financial statements in the next few years. If adopted, such a change would require us to record a significant amount of lease related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and make other changes to the recording and classification of lease related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. In addition, as discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, accounting authorities issued a new revenue standard and the Company is still evaluating the impact of this new standard. These and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations, or the questioning of current accounting practices, may adversely affect our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.\nWe must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal controls over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We cannot be assured that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will prove to be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows as well as on the price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis, including in the countries in which we have business operations or plan to have business operations. Because we have not registered all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we source or offer our merchandise now, or may in the future, our international expansion and our merchandising of products using these marks could be limited. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks in the United States or Canada. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken, including to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks, may not be adequate to prevent others from imitating our products or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. Also, others may assert proprietary rights in our intellectual property and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Any litigation regarding our trademarks could be time-consuming and costly. The loss of exclusive use of our trademarks could have a material adverse effect on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe face challenges to grow our business and to manage our growth.\nOur growth is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to successfully add new stores. In addition, on a routine basis, we close under-performing stores, which may result in write-offs. The success of our growth strategy depends upon a number of factors, including, among others, the identification of suitable markets and sites for new stores, negotiation of leases on acceptable terms, construction or renovation of sites in a timely manner at acceptable costs and maintenance of the productivity of our existing store base. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. We must be able to hire, train and retain competent managers and personnel and manage the systems and operational components of our growth. Our failure to open new stores on a timely basis, obtain acceptance in markets in which we currently have limited or no presence, attract qualified management and personnel or appropriately adjust operational systems and procedures could have an adverse effect on our growth prospects.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors negatively impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, high unemployment, lower wage levels, increased taxation, high consumer debt, reductions in net worth based on severe market declines (such as in residential real estate markets), higher fuel, energy and other prices, increasing interest rates, severe weather conditions and low consumer confidence. In addition, any significant volatility in our financial markets could also negatively impact the levels of future discretionary consumer spending. Such macroeconomic and other factors could have a negative effect on consumer spending in the U.S., which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAs described in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, we have significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisitions of maurices in January 2005, Tween Brands in November 2009 and Lane Bryant and Catherines in June 2012. Current and future economic conditions may adversely impact our brands' ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, maintain sales volumes and maintain margins. As discussed in our Critical Accounting Policies included elsewhere herein, these events could materially reduce our brands' profitability and cash flow which could, in turn, lead to an impairment of Justice\u2019s, Lane Bryant\u2019s, maurices\u2019 or Catherines\u2019 goodwill and other intangible assets in addition to the impairment losses of $306.4 million recorded during Fiscal 2015 to write down the carrying value of Lane Bryant's goodwill and intangible asset to their implied fair value. Furthermore, if customer attrition were to accelerate significantly, the value of Justice\u2019s, Lane Bryant\u2019s, maurices\u2019 or Catherines\u2019 intangible assets could be impaired or subject to accelerated amortization.\nIn addition, we expect to have significant goodwill and intangible assets related to the ANN Acquisition. As with our other acquisitions, current and future economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and to maintain sales volumes and margins. These events could materially reduce ANN's profitability and cash flows which could, in turn, lead to an impairment of ANN's goodwill and intangible assets in future periods.\nOur business could suffer a material adverse effect from extreme or unseasonable weather conditions.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which the Company's stores are located could negatively affect the Company's business, operational results, financial position, and cash flows. Frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over an extended period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores, which could negatively impact the Company's operational results. The Company's business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could influence customer trends, consumer traffic and shopping habits. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool temperatures during the summer season could reduce demand and thereby would have an adverse effect on our operational results, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nOur common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The Company\u2019s stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility due to many factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, stock and credit market conditions, quarter to quarter variations in our actual or anticipated financial results and investor sentiment. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nFurther, if the analysts that regularly follow the Company\u2019s performance lower their ratings or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance, the Company\u2019s stock price could be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 30737, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "ASNAQ"}
