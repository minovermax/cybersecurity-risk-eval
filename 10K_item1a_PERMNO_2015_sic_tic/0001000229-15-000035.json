RISK FACTORS\nOur forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that may not prove to be accurate. All of our forward-looking information is, therefore, subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected. All known, material risks and uncertainties are discussed below.\nDownturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and demand for the majority of our oilfield services and products is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry's view of future oil and gas prices. There are numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for our services and products, which are summarized as:\n\u25aa\ngeneral and economic business conditions;\n\u25aa\nmarket prices of oil and gas and expectations about future prices;\n\u25aa\ncost of producing and the ability to deliver oil and natural gas;\n\u25aa\nthe level of drilling and production activity;\n\u25aa\nmergers, consolidations and downsizing among our clients;\n\u25aa\ncoordination by OPEC;\n\u25aa\nthe impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients;\n\u25aa\nfinancial condition of our client base and their ability to fund capital expenditures;\n\u25aa\nthe physical effects of climatic change, including adverse weather or geologic/geophysical conditions;\n\u25aa\nthe adoption of legal requirements or taxation relating to climate change that lower the demand for petroleum-based fuels;\n\u25aa\ncivil unrest or political uncertainty in oil producing or consuming countries;\n\u25aa\nlevel of consumption of oil, gas and petrochemicals by consumers;\n\u25aa\nchanges in existing laws, regulations, or other governmental actions, including temporary or permanent moratoria on hydraulic fracturing or offshore drilling;\n\u25aa\nthe business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by us;\n\u25aa\navailability of services and materials for our clients to grow their capital expenditures;\n\u25aa\nability of our clients to deliver product to market;\n\u25aa\navailability of materials and equipment from key suppliers; and\n\u25aa\ncyber-attacks on our network that disrupt operations or result in lost or compromised critical data.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and products and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on the results of our international operations, which expose us to risks inherent in doing business abroad.\nWe conduct our business in over 50 countries; business outside of the United States accounted for approximately 52%, 55% and 54% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Prior to 2014, we attributed revenue to the country in which the revenue was earned. During 2014, we began attributing sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of revenue recorded in the U.S., where the services were performed, that are sourced from projects on foreign oilfields.\nOur operations, and those of our clients, are subject to the various laws and regulations of those respective countries as well as various risks peculiar to each country, which may include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aa\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u25aa\npolitical actions and requirements of national governments including trade restrictions, embargoes, seizure, detention, nationalization and expropriations of assets;\n\u25aa\ninterpretation of tax statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide, routine examination by taxing authorities and assessment of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest;\n\u25aa\ncivil unrest;\n\u25aa\nacts of terrorism;\n\u25aa\nfluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates (see section below);\n\u25aa\nthe impact of inflation;\n\u25aa\ndifficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of the local currency requirements; and\n\u25aa\ncurrent conditions in oil producing countries such as Venezuela, Nigeria, Libya, Iran and Iraq considering their potential impact on the world markets.\nHistorically, economic downturn and political events have resulted in lower demand for our services and products in certain markets. The continuing instability in the Middle East and North Africa and the potential for activity from terrorist groups that the U.S. government has cautioned against have further heightened our exposure to international risks. The global economy is highly influenced by public confidence in the geopolitical environment and the situation in the Middle East and North Africa continues to be highly fluid; therefore, we expect to experience heightened international risks.\nOur results of operations may be significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nWe are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. By the nature of our business, we derive a substantial amount of our revenue from our international operations, subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected because our efforts to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws such as the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and the United Kingdom's Anti-Bribery Act (the \"ABA\") could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to these laws.\nWe operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that we are prohibited from using.\nWe are subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA and the ABA, which generally prohibits us and our intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. In particular, we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to these laws. Any such violations could result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our ability to continue to work in these parts of the world discussed above could be adversely affected if we were found to have violated certain laws, including the FCPA and the ABA.\nIf we are not able to develop or acquire new products or our products become technologically obsolete, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. While we intend to continue committing substantial financial resources and effort to the development of new services and products, we may not be able to successfully differentiate our services and products from those of our competitors. Our clients may not consider our proposed services and products to be of value to them; or if the proposed services and products are of a competitive nature, our clients may not view them as superior to our competitors' services and products. In addition, we may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies, develop new products, or achieve and maintain technological advantages.\nIf we are unable to continue developing competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our businesses and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, continuing development of new products inherently carries the risk of inventory obsolescence with respect to our older products.\nIf we are unable to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our services and products, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our services and products. To that end, we have obtained certain patents and intend to continue to seek patents on some of our inventions, services and products. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology, even when regarded as patentable. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain countries. Litigation, which could demand significant financial and management resources, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights. Also, there can be no assurance that we can obtain licenses or other rights to necessary intellectual property on acceptable terms.\nThere are risks relating to our acquisition strategy. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage businesses that we have acquired and any businesses acquired in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOne of our key business strategies is to acquire technologies, operations and assets that are complementary to our existing businesses. There are financial, operational and legal risks inherent in any acquisition strategy, including:\n\u25aa\nincreased financial leverage;\n\u25aa\nability to obtain additional financing;\n\u25aa\nincreased interest expense; and\n\u25aa\ndifficulties involved in combining disparate company cultures and facilities.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which may result in increased costs and significant liability to our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of stringent governmental laws and regulations both in the United States and abroad relating to protection of the environment, occupational health and safety and the use and storage of chemicals and gases used in our analytical and manufacturing processes and the discharge and disposal of wastes generated by those processes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for environmental liabilities, such as the remediation of historical contamination or recent spills, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the assessment of damages, fines and penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective action obligations or the suspension or cessation of some or all of our operations. These stringent laws and regulations could require us to acquire permits or other authorizations to conduct regulated activities, install and maintain costly equipment and pollution control technologies, impose specific safety and health standards addressing work protection, or to incur costs or liabilities to mitigate or remediate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former owners or operators. If we fail to control the use, or adequately restrict the emission or discharge, of hazardous substances or wastes, we could be subject to future material liabilities including remedial obligations. In addition, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years with governmental authorities imposing more stringent and restrictive requirements. We anticipate that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental laws and regulations will continue, the occurrence of which may require us to increase our capital expenditures or could result in increased operating expenses.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Regulatory frameworks adopted, or being considered for adoption, to reduce GHG emissions include cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, the European Emissions Trading Scheme is a\nprogram through which many of the European Union member states are implementing cap and trade controls covering numerous power stations and industrial facilities. Also, international accords for GHG reduction are evolving, but they have uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. These proposed or promulgated laws and legal initiatives apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. These requirements could make our services and products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for the production of oil and natural gas, which could decrease demand for our services and products. In the United States, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing emissions of GHGs and Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs but no such legislation has yet been adopted. However, the EPA made findings in 2009 that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment and, based on these findings, has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of criteria pollutant emissions and that require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources in the United States, which include the operations of many of our exploration and production clients. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in the United State would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our clients\u2019 operations could require our clients to incur increased costs and also could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that they produce, which could decrease demand for our services and products.\nHydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. Hydraulic fracturing activity is more extensively pursued in the United States than internationally. Some countries outside the United States, such as Bulgaria and France, currently have imposed moratoria on hydraulic fracturing while other countries, such as the United Kingdom, allow fracturing activities but those activities are not as widely pursued as they are in the United States. In the United States, the fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued final Clean Air Act regulations in 2012 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; announced its intent to propose in the first half of 2015 effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, in 2013, the BLM issued a revised proposed rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the agency is now analyzing comments to the proposed rulemaking and is expected to promulgate a final rule in the first half of 2015.In addition, the United States Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. At the state level, a growing number of states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit fracturing altogether, as the State of New York announced in December 2014 with regard to fracturing activities in New York. In addition, local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions related to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our exploration and production clients\u2019 operate, those clients could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for our products and services. Further, several federal governmental agencies in the United States are conducting studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities. In particular, the EPA is pursuing a study on the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources, with a draft report expected to be issued for public comment and peer review in the first half of 2015. On-going or future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing in the United States, which events could delay or curtail production of natural gas by exploration and production operators, some of which are our clients, and thus reduce demand for our products and services.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable employees, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled engineers, geologists and highly trained technicians, and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the oilfield services industry. We may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for these skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for oil and gas. Additionally, at times there may be a shortage of skilled and technical personnel\navailable in the market, potentially compounding the difficulty of attracting and retaining these employees. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, and our ability to generate cash may depend on factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures depends, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future. This ability is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nNo assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure that any refinancing or debt restructuring would be possible or, if possible, would be completed on favorable or acceptable terms, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales would be favorable to us or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance our indebtedness, including our ability to borrow under our existing revolving credit facility (\"Credit Facility\"). Banks that are party to our existing Credit Facility may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time.\nBecause we are a Netherlands company, it may be difficult for you to take legal action against our supervisory directors or us and it may not be possible to obtain or enforce judgments against us.\nAlthough we are a Netherlands company, our assets are located in a variety of countries. In addition, not all members of our supervisory board of directors are residents of the same countries as other supervisory directors. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within certain countries upon our supervisory directors, or to enforce against our supervisory directors or use judgments of courts of certain countries predicated upon civil liabilities under a country's federal securities laws. Because there is no treaty between certain countries and The Netherlands providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, some countries' judgments are not automatically enforceable in The Netherlands or in the United States, where the principal market for our shares is located. In addition, there is doubt as to whether a court in one country would impose civil liability on us or on the members of our supervisory board of directors in an original action brought against us or our supervisory directors in a court of competent jurisdiction in another country and predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of that other country.\nOur operations are subject to the risk of cyber-attacks that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nOur information technology systems are subject to possible breaches and other threats that could cause us harm. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or client data, interruption of business operations, or additional costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber security attacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nRegulations related to conflict-free minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in our manufacturing processes.\nIn August 2012, the SEC issued their final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements by public companies of their use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) and whether these minerals originate in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We have performed specified reasonable country of origin inquiry activities throughout the 2013 and 2014 calendar years, and filed our first report in May 2014. As our suppliers determine the original source of the conflict minerals they sell or use in their manufacturing processes, we may find that sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain of these conflict minerals could be affected. If the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals is limited, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to purchase these products or to purchase these products at a favorable price or on favorable terms in the future.", "PERMNO": 82656, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "CLB"}
