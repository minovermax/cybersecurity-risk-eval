Risk Factors\nOur business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. You should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties we describe below and all of the other information in this Report before deciding to invest in our stock. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties about which we currently do not know or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our businesses, financial condition or operating results.\nThe amounts distributed in the future to Actua\u2019s stockholders, if any, may be substantially less than Actua's estimates.\nAt present, the Board cannot determine with certainty the amount of any future distribution to Actua\u2019s stockholders. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to Actua\u2019s stockholders in any additional liquidating distribution depends on, among other things, the amount of Actua\u2019s liabilities, obligations and expenses and claims against Actua, and the amount of the reserves that Actua establishes during the liquidation process. Actua\u2019s estimates of these amounts may be inaccurate. Factors that could negatively impact Actua\u2019s estimates include the following:\n\u2022\nif any of Actua\u2019s estimates regarding the Plan of Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims during the liquidation process, are inaccurate;\n\u2022\nif any of Actua\u2019s estimates regarding the expected costs associated with defending, resolving or settling any litigation matters, including the Bolt litigation as reflected in reserves which Actua has established, are inaccurate;\n\u2022\nif other litigation is brought against Actua and/or its directors and officers;\n\u2022\nif unforeseen claims are asserted against Actua, Actua must defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before making distributions to its stockholders;\n\u2022\nif the net proceeds received by Actua for its non-cash property and assets, including the Minority Investments, or any other Potential Additional Proceeds are significantly lower than Actua\u2019s estimates;\n\u2022\nif any of Actua\u2019s estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, including expenses of personnel required and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidate Actua, are inaccurate; and\n\u2022\nif Actua is unable to obtain relief from certain reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and must incur significant expenses related to ongoing reporting obligations.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, the amount distributed to Actua\u2019s stockholders may be substantially less than the amount Actua currently estimates.\nIn addition, under Delaware law, claims and demands may be asserted against Actua at any time during the three years following the effective date of the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution. Accordingly, the Board may obtain and maintain insurance coverage for such potential claims. Actua has reserved approximately $10.6 million of cash for unknown, contingent and/or conditional liabilities, including liabilities relating to the Bolt Litigation or to potential claims for indemnification in connection with sales of Actua's businesses, and may also set aside additional amounts of cash (including all or a portion of the net proceeds of any sale of the Minority Investments and any other Potential Additional Proceeds) or other assets as a reserve to satisfy claims against and obligations of Actua that may arise during the three-year period following the effective date of the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution. As a result of these factors, Actua may retain for distribution at a later date some or all of the estimated amounts that it expects to distribute to stockholders.\nActua may not be able to settle all of its obligations, which may delay or reduce additional liquidating distributions to Actua\u2019s stockholders.\nActua has current and future obligations to third parties, some of which are contingent. Actua\u2019s estimated remaining distributions to its stockholders take into account all of Actua\u2019s known liabilities and certain possible contingent liabilities and the Board\u2019s best estimate of the amount reasonably required to satisfy such liabilities. As part of the wind-down process, Actua intends to discharge all of its obligations to third parties. Actua cannot assure you that unknown liabilities that that have not been accounted for will not arise, that Actua will be able to settle all of its liabilities or that Actua\u2019s liabilities can be settled for the amounts Actua has estimated for purposes of calculating the range of distribution to its stockholders. If Actua is unable to reach an agreement with a third party relating to a liability, that third party may bring a lawsuit against Actua. Amounts required to settle liabilities or to defend, resolve or settle lawsuits in excess of the amounts estimated will reduce the amount of net proceeds available for distribution to stockholders.\nActua may not be able to sell Actua\u2019s minority holdings during the expected time frame, for amounts projected or otherwise on desirable terms, which may delay or reduce additional liquidating distributions to Actua\u2019s stockholders.\nIn connection with the dissolution process, Actua intends to attempt to monetize its remaining holdings, which consist largely of the Minority Investments, and to distribute its other cash assets. However, these holdings are largely illiquid, such that it may be difficult or impossible for Actua to monetize them during the expected time frame, for amounts projected or otherwise on desirable terms, and there can be no assurance as to how long this process will take.\nActua may not receive some or all of certain cash inflows it currently expects to receive during the identified time frame, or the actual amounts Actua receives in connection therewith may be substantially less than Actua currently expects, which may delay or reduce additional liquidating distributions to Actua\u2019s stockholders.\nActua\u2019s current estimates of the amounts it will have available to fund the reserve for payment of its expenses and liabilities during the three-year period following the effective date of the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution and the amounts it will have available for additional liquidating distributions to its stockholders are based on, among other things, certain assumptions with respect to the receipt of the Potential Additional Proceeds. If the Potential Additional Proceeds actually received are significantly lower than Actua\u2019s estimates, or if Actua does not receive the Potential Additional Proceeds during the identified time frame, the amount distributed to Actua\u2019s stockholders may be substantially less than the amount Actua currently estimates. For instance, since a definitive agreement for a Bolt Sale was not executed prior to March 30, 2018, Actua will not receive additional proceeds with respect to a Bolt sale. Additionally, one of FolioDynamix\u2019s clients had a certain time period following the consummation of the sale of Actua\u2019s interest in FolioDynamix to provide or withhold a required waiver of a termination right (or allow such right to expire), and if such client elects to exercise this termination right, Actua will not receive additional proceeds with respect to the Client Consent Adjustment Amount (as defined in the Folio Sale Agreement).\nThe Board may abandon or delay implementation of the Plan of Dissolution even if approved by Actua\u2019s stockholders.\nEven if Actua\u2019s stockholders approve the Plan of Dissolution, the Board has reserved the right, in its discretion, to the extent permitted by Delaware law, to abandon or delay implementation of the Plan of Dissolution if such action is determined to be in the best interests of Actua and its stockholders, in order, for example, to permit Actua to pursue strategic alternatives. Any such decision to abandon or delay implementation of the Plan of Dissolution may result in Actua incurring additional operating costs and liabilities, which could reduce the amount available for additional liquidating distributions to Actua\u2019s stockholders. Additionally, if Actua\u2019s stockholders approve the Plan of Dissolution, Actua may, subject to approval by the Board but without further stockholder approval, make an assignment for benefit of its creditors under applicable state law, and thereby liquidate and wind up its affairs through such an assignment for benefit of creditors proceeding under applicable law, as further described below.\nThe payment of additional liquidating distributions, if any, to Actua\u2019s stockholders could be delayed.\nAlthough the Board has not established a firm timetable for additional liquidating distributions to Actua\u2019s stockholders, the Board intends, subject to contingencies inherent in winding down Actua\u2019s business, to make such additional liquidating distributions, if any, from time to time following the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution in light of when creditor claims and contingent liabilities are paid or settled. However, Actua is currently unable to predict the precise timing of any such additional liquidating distributions or whether any additional liquidating distributions will occur at all. The timing of any such additional liquidating distributions will depend on and could be delayed by, among other things, the outcome of the Bolt Litigation and any settlements of obligations to third parties, including any potential claims for indemnification in connection with sales of Actua's businesses. Additionally, a creditor could seek an injunction against the making of such distributions to Actua\u2019s stockholders on the basis that the amounts to be distributed were needed to provide for the payment of Actua\u2019s liabilities and expenses. Any action of this type could delay or substantially diminish the amount available for such distribution to Actua\u2019s stockholders.\nActua will continue to incur claims, liabilities and expenses that will reduce the amount available for distribution.\nClaims, liabilities and expenses from operations, such as operating costs, salaries, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, payroll and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and miscellaneous office expenses, will continue to be incurred as Actua winds down. These expenses could be much higher than currently anticipated and will reduce the amount of assets available for ultimate distribution to stockholders.\nIf Actua fails to create an adequate reserve for payment of its expenses and liabilities, each stockholder receiving liquidating distributions could be held liable for payment to Actua\u2019s creditors of his, her or its pro rata share of amounts owed to creditors in excess of the reserve, up to the amount actually distributed to such stockholder in connection with the dissolution.\nIf the Plan of Dissolution is approved by Actua\u2019s stockholders, Actua expects to file a Certificate of Dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State dissolving Actua. Pursuant to Delaware law, Actua will continue to exist for three years after its dissolution or for such longer period as the Delaware Court of Chancery shall direct, or as may be required to resolve any pending litigation matters, for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits against Actua and enabling Actua to gradually close its business, dispose of its property, discharge its liabilities and to distribute to its stockholders any remaining assets. In the event Actua fails to create during this three-year period an adequate reserve for payment of its expenses and liabilities (and, after accounting for its receipt of the net proceeds of any sale of the Minority Investments and any other Potential Additional Proceeds, otherwise does not have sufficient assets for payment of its expenses and liabilities), creditors of Actua may be able to pursue claims against Actua\u2019s stockholders directly to an extent they have claims co-extensive with such stockholders\u2019 receipt of liquidating distributions. Although the liability of any stockholder is limited to the amounts previously received by such stockholder from Actua (and from any liquidating trust or trusts) pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution, this means that a stockholder could be required to return all liquidating distributions previously made to such stockholder and receive nothing from Actua under the Plan of Dissolution. Moreover, in the event a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received, a repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a stockholder incurring a net tax cost if the stockholder\u2019s repayment of an amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable. There can be no guarantee that the reserves established by Actua will be adequate to satisfy all such expenses and liabilities.\nFurther stockholder approval will not be required in connection with the implementation of the Plan of Dissolution, including for the sale of all or substantially all of Actua\u2019s non-cash assets, if any, as contemplated in the Plan of Dissolution.\nThe approval of the Plan of Dissolution by Actua\u2019s stockholders will also authorize, without further stockholder approval, the Board and, if applicable, the Manager to take such actions as they deem necessary, appropriate or desirable to implement the Plan of Dissolution and the transactions contemplated thereby. Accordingly, Actua may dispose of its non-cash assets without further stockholder approval.\nActua intends to seek relief from certain reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, which may substantially reduce publicly-available information about Actua. If Actua fails to obtain such relief, Actua will continue to bear the expense of being a public reporting company despite having no significant source of revenue.\nActua\u2019s common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, which requires that Actua, and its officers and directors with respect to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, comply with certain public reporting and proxy statement requirements thereunder. Compliance with these requirements is costly and time-consuming. Actua anticipates that, in order to curtail expenses, it will request relief from the SEC to suspend certain of its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. If such relief is granted, publicly-available information about Actua will be substantially reduced. However, the SEC may not grant such relief at all or on a timely basis, in which case Actua would be required to continue to incur substantial accounting, legal and other expenses associated with being a public company despite having no significant source of revenue.\nAlthough the Board will be responsible for overseeing the Plan of Dissolution, the Board\u2019s authority could effectively be transferred to a liquidating trustee or some other party.\nUnder Delaware law, a company\u2019s board of directors retains ultimate decision-making authority following a company\u2019s dissolution, and therefore the Board would initially be responsible for overseeing the Plan of Dissolution. However, pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution, a liquidating trust could be used to complete the dissolution, or, under Delaware law, any director, creditor, stockholder or other party showing good cause could seek court appointment of a trustee or receiver to complete the dissolution.\nInterests of Actua\u2019s stockholders in Actua after the Final Record Date, and interests of Actua\u2019s stockholders in any liquidating trust Actua may establish pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution, may not be assignable or transferable.\nActua intends to discontinue recording transfers of shares of its common stock on the Final Record Date, and thereafter certificates representing shares of Actua\u2019s common stock will not be assignable or transferable on Actua\u2019s books except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. In addition, if Actua were to establish a liquidating trust, the interests of its stockholders in such liquidating trust would similarly not be assignable or transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law, which could adversely affect its stockholders\u2019 ability to realize the value of such interests. Furthermore, given that Actua\u2019s stockholders will be deemed to have received a liquidating distribution equal to their pro rata share of the value of the net assets distributed to any entity which is treated as a liquidating trust for tax purposes, the distribution of non-transferable interests would result in tax liability to the stockholders without them being readily able to realize the value of such interest to pay such taxes or otherwise.\nActua may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the distribution of any property other than cash.\nIf Actua distributes any property other than cash in an additional liquidating distribution to its stockholders, Actua will recognize gain or loss as if such property were sold to the stockholders at its fair market value. Accordingly, Actua may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a distribution of its property (other than cash), which may reduce the amount of cash available to distribute to its stockholders. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may challenge Actua\u2019s valuation of any distributed property. As a result of such a challenge, the amount of gain or loss recognized by Actua and its stockholders on the property distribution might change.\nIf Actua\u2019s stockholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, they may be subject to less favorable tax consequences on the receipt of the Transaction Distribution.\nThe Transaction Distribution will be treated as a non-liquidating distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes if Actua\u2019s stockholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution. Non-liquidating distributions would be taxable as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of Actua\u2019s current or accumulated earnings and profits and may be subject to tax at rates that are higher than those applicable to liquidating distributions. Furthermore, Actua\u2019s stockholders would not be able to reduce their adjusted tax basis in their shares of Actua\u2019s common stock prior to recognizing non-liquidating distributions that are taxable as dividends in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIn addition, foreign stockholders receiving non-liquidating distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as is established under an applicable treaty. Until the Plan of Dissolution is approved, Actua has withheld tax at a rate of 30% from the Transaction Distribution made to foreign stockholders. If the Plan of Dissolution is ultimately approved by Actua\u2019s stockholders, Actua will distribute the previously withheld amounts to foreign stockholders, as applicable.\nThe tax treatment of any liquidating distributions may vary from stockholder to stockholder, and the discussions in this Report regarding such tax treatment are general in nature. You should consult your own tax advisor instead of relying on the discussions of tax treatment in this Report for tax advice.\nActua has not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of the Plan of Dissolution, and will not seek an opinion of counsel with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of any liquidating distributions. If any of the anticipated tax consequences of the Plan of Dissolution described in this Report proves to be incorrect, the result could be increased taxation at the corporate and/or stockholder level, thus reducing the benefit to Actua\u2019s stockholders and Actua from the liquidation and distributions. Tax considerations applicable to particular stockholders may vary with and be contingent upon the stockholder\u2019s individual circumstances.\nThird party attempts to breach, or an actual breach of our networks or data security or the existence of any other security vulnerabilities could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough we have adopted a number of measures to enhance our cybersecurity protection at Actua, there can be no assurance that our information will not be subject to cyberattacks, computer break-ins, theft and other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information or cause interruptions in the operations of our business. In addition, third parties that use or have access to our sensitive business information could experience security breaches that could adversely impact our reputation.\nOur security measures or those of third parties that use or have access to our sensitive information may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our data. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees into disclosing sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we may not be able to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities could cause us to incur significant additional costs to alleviate problems caused by any such actual or perceived vulnerabilities. Those costs could reduce our operating margins and expose us to litigation, loss of customers, reputation damage and other business harm that could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 87167, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "ACTA"}
