{"cik": "1490660", "company": "Marketo, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve consistent profitability in the future.\nWe generated net losses attributable to Marketo of $54.3 million, $47.4 million and $34.4 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $183.9 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods in order to become consistently profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand our marketing and sales operations, develop and enhance our solutions, meet the increased compliance requirements associated with our operation as a public company, expand our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and expand into new markets. Historically, we also have experienced negative gross margins on our professional services, which are expected to continue to be negative. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this report, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties,\ncomplications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or sell additional services and functionality to our existing customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, we must add new customers, encourage existing customers to renew their subscriptions on terms favorable to us, increase their usage of our solutions, and sell additional functionality and services to existing customers. As our industry matures, as interactive channels develop further, or as competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell and renew based on pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers or new business from existing customers on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and growth.\nWe face significant competition from both established and new companies offering marketing solutions and other related applications, as well as internally developed solutions, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers and grow our business.\nThe market for cloud-based marketing solutions is evolving, highly competitive and fragmented. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. With the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase renewals and maintain our prices.\nWe face intense competition from other software companies that develop marketing software and from marketing services companies that provide interactive marketing services. Competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our marketing solutions on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. In addition, if these competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins will be reduced and our operating results will be negatively affected.\nOur competitors offer various solutions that compete with us. Some of these competitors include:\n\u2022 cloud-based marketing automation providers such as Act-On, Eloqua (acquired by Oracle in 2012), ExactTarget (acquired by salesforce.com in July 2013) and HubSpot;\n\u2022 traditional database marketing software vendors such as Aprimo (a division of Teradata), SAS Institute and Unica (a division of IBM);\n\u2022 email marketing software vendors, such as Responsys (acquired by Oracle in early 2014) and Silverpop (acquired by IBM in the first-half of 2014); and\n\u2022 large-scale enterprise suites such as Oracle and SAP.\nWe also expect that new competitors, such as enterprise software vendors that have traditionally focused on enterprise resource planning or back office applications, will continue to enter the marketing software market with competing products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, due to the growing awareness of the importance of technology solutions to modern relationship marketing, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants to our markets. In addition to salesforce.com's acquisition of ExactTarget, other sales force automation and CRM system vendors, such as Microsoft, NetSuite and\nSAP, could acquire or develop solutions that compete with our offerings. Some of these companies have acquired social media marketing and other marketing software providers to integrate with their broader offerings.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, and may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. In a few cases, these vendors may also be able to offer marketing software at little or no additional cost by bundling them with their existing suite of solutions. To the extent any of our competitors have existing relationships with potential customers for either marketing software or other solutions, those customers may be unwilling to purchase our solutions because of those existing relationships with that competitor. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our marketing solutions could substantially decline.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. For example, Oracle acquired our competitor Eloqua in 2012 and ExactTarget acquired our competitor Pardot in 2012 and salesforce.com subsequently acquired ExactTarget in July 2013. Other companies such as Adobe and IBM have also recently acquired companies in the marketing automation and/or social marketing and related spaces. These acquisitions have resulted in fewer but larger companies with whom we compete for customers. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic distribution and technology partners or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote and implement our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf subscription renewal rates decrease, or we do not accurately predict subscription renewal rates, our future revenue and operating results may be harmed.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of their subscription period, which is typically one year, but ranges from one to three years. In addition, our customers may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter contract lengths. We may not accurately predict renewal rates for our customers. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer usage, pricing changes, number of applications used by our customers, customer satisfaction with our service, increased competition, the acquisition of our customers by other companies and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.\nIf we are unable to maintain a good relationship with salesforce.com and develop and grow our relationships with other platform providers, our business will suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2014, a significant percentage of our customers continued to integrate our solutions with certain capabilities of salesforce.com using publicly available application programming interfaces (APIs). In general, we rely on the fact that salesforce.com continues to allow us access to its APIs to enable these customer integrations. To date, we have not relied on a long-term written contract to govern our relationship with salesforce.com. Instead, we are subject to the standard terms and conditions for application developers of salesforce.com, which govern the distribution, operation and fees of applications on the salesforce.com platform, and which are subject to change by salesforce.com from time to time. While we expect the majority of our revenue to continue to come from customers who also use the salesforce.com platform in the near term, we also integrate our solutions with other\nplatform providers, including Microsoft, NetSuite, SAP and SugarCRM. Any deterioration in our relationship with any platform provider would harm our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business may be harmed if any platform provider:\n\u2022 discontinues or limits our access to its APIs;\n\u2022 terminates or does not allow us to renew or replace our contractual relationship;\n\u2022 modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us, other application developers, or changes how customer information is accessed by us or our customers;\n\u2022 establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors, or acquires one or more of our competitors and offers competing services to us; or\n\u2022 otherwise develops its own competitive offerings.\nIn addition, we have benefited from these platform providers' brand recognition, reputations and customer bases. Any losses or shifts in the market position of these platform providers in general, in relation to one another or to new competitors or new technologies could lead to losses in our relationships or customers, or our need to identify or transition to alternative channels for marketing our solutions. These factors could consume substantial resources and may not be effective. Any such changes in the future could negatively impact our ability to reach our prospective customers, which would harm our business.\nOur recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nFrom 2012 to 2014, our annual revenue grew from $58.4 million to $150.0 million. We expect that, in the future, if our revenue increases to higher levels, our revenue growth rate will decline. We believe growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 price our marketing solutions and services effectively so that we are able to attract and retain customers without compromising our profitability;\n\u2022 attract new customers, increase our existing customers' use of our services and provide our customers with excellent professional services and customer support;\n\u2022 introduce our marketing solutions to new markets outside of the United States; and\n\u2022 increase awareness of our brand on a global basis.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. We plan to continue our investment in future growth. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022 sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales organization;\n\u2022 professional services to support implementing our solutions for customers and ongoing customer support;\n\u2022 our technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, management tools, scalability, availability, performance and security, as well as disaster recovery measures;\n\u2022 product development, including investments in our product development team and the development of new products and new features for existing products;\n\u2022 international expansion; and\n\u2022 general administration, including legal and accounting expenses related to being a public company.\nIn addition, our historical rapid growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. We have also experienced significant growth in database size, the number of users and transactions and the amount of data that our hosting infrastructure supports. As we continue to grow, we will likely open new offices in the United States and internationally, and hire additional personnel for those offices. Finally, our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we integrate acquired companies as well as add additional employees. We will need to improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures as our operations become increasingly complex. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our corporate culture of rapid innovation, teamwork and attention to customer success that has been central to our growth so far.\nIf our or our customers' security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our marketing platform may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or cease their use of our solutions, our reputation may be harmed, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of customer data, including personally identifiable information, and security incidents could result in unauthorized access to, loss of or unauthorized disclosure of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales and harm our business. Cyber attacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and cloud-based platform providers of marketing services have been targeted. If our security measures are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liability. In addition, if the security measures of our customers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches on us or our systems. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized access to our customers' data.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. In addition, some of our customers contractually require notification of any data security compromise or suspected compromise. Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance\npolicies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nInterruptions to or degraded performance of our service could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\nWe currently host our solutions at facilities located in the United States, the European Union and Australia. The continuous availability of our service depends on the operations of those facilities, on a variety of network service providers, on third-party vendors and on our own data center operations staff. In addition, we depend on our third-party facility providers' abilities to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. If there are any lapses of service or damage to a facility or our computer equipment or systems, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities, services, computer equipment or system. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, which, to date, have not been tested in an actual crisis, our business could be harmed.\nWe designed our system infrastructure and procure and own or lease the computer hardware used for our services. Design and mechanical errors, spikes in usage volume and failure to follow operations protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions in our solutions. Any interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and cause our revenue to decrease and/or our expenses to increase. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors, in turn, could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause customers not to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers' growing needs, and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs our customer base grows and as customers use our solutions for more advanced relationship marketing programs, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating with third- party systems, and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer demographics expand over time. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our marketing solutions to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could adversely affect our revenue growth and harm our reputation. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely affect our financial results.\nIf we are unable to further penetrate the business to consumer (B2C) market and additional vertical industries, our revenue may not grow and our operating results may be harmed.\nCurrently, a significant majority of our revenue is derived from companies in the business to business (B2B) market and a significant portion is derived from customers in the technology industry. An important part of our strategy, however, is to further penetrate the business to consumer (B2C) market and vertical industries outside of technology, such as healthcare. We have less experience in this market and these industries, and expanding into them may require us to develop additional features for our products, expand our expertise in certain areas, and add sales and support personnel possessing familiarity with this market and the relevant vertical industries. In addition, B2C customers may have greater usage requirements during their peak selling seasons which could put pressure on our systems and infrastructure and require us to expand these systems and infrastructure to meet increased demand. As a result of these and other factors, our efforts to expand further into the B2C market and further into additional vertical industries may be expensive, may not succeed and may harm our revenue growth and operating results.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described in this report, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u2022 changes in spending on marketing solutions by our current or prospective customers;\n\u2022 pricing of our marketing solutions so that we are able to attract and retain customers;\n\u2022 acquisition of new customers and increases of our existing customers' use of our services;\n\u2022 customer renewal rates and the amounts for which agreements are renewed;\n\u2022 customer delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 budgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u2022 changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses (including marketing events and commissions and bonuses associated with performance), and employee benefit expenses;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments and other non-cash charges;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers and the mix of quarterly and annual billings;\n\u2022 introduction and adoption of our marketing solutions in markets outside of the United States;\n\u2022 unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022 awareness of our thought leadership and brand on a global basis;\n\u2022 changes in the levels of our capital expenditures;\n\u2022 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022 general economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast the amount and mix of future subscriptions, revenue and expenses, and, as a result, our operating results may fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, or below any guidance we may provide, the price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards or changing customer needs or requirements, our marketing solutions may become less competitive.\nOur future success depends on our ability to adapt and innovate our marketing solutions. To attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we need to continually enhance and improve our offerings to meet customer needs at prices that our customers are willing to pay. Such efforts will require adding new functionality and responding to technological advancements, which will increase our research and development costs. If we are unable to develop new solutions that address our customers' needs, or to enhance and improve our solutions in a timely manner, we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market acceptance of our solutions. Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. Access and use of our marketing solutions is provided via the cloud, which, itself, was disruptive to the previous enterprise software model. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver marketing solutions and related applications at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant contract, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nAs a subscription-based business, we recognize revenue over the term of each of our contracts, which is typically one year, but range from one to three years. As a result, much of the revenue we report each quarter results from contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our solutions and professional services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter but could negatively affect our revenue in the future. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new sales or renewals of our marketing solutions will not be reflected in full in our operating results until future periods. Our revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the contracts.\nBecause our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nA component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. In 2014, 2013 and 2012 revenue generated outside of the United States was 16.1%, 14.5% and 12.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. We currently have international offices outside of North America in Europe, Australia, and Japan which focus primarily on selling and implementing our solutions in those regions and an office in Israel which focuses primarily on research\nand development. We recently opened a data center located in Australia and, in the future, we may expand to other international locations. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022 changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;\n\u2022 more stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information\n\u2022 differing labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n\u2022 challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;\n\u2022 increased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;\n\u2022 limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u2022 laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;\n\u2022 limited or insufficient intellectual property protection;\n\u2022 political instability, international conflict or terrorist activities;\n\u2022 exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022 adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nWe opened our first international office in 2011, and our relatively limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our solutions.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our marketing solutions will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations. We plan to continue expanding our sales force and third-party channel partners, both domestically and internationally. We also plan to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including Internet and other online advertising. The effectiveness of our online advertising has varied over time and may vary in the future due to competition for key search terms, changes in search engine use and changes in the search algorithms used by major search engines. All of these efforts will require\nus to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to acquire customers is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that our development of the Marketo brand is critical to achieving widespread awareness of our existing and future marketing software solutions, and, as a result, is important to attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful marketing software at competitive prices. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. Our brand could be negatively affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. For example, to sell to and service our customers we utilize a combination of internal personnel and third-party service providers, as well as indirect sales partners that pursue additional channel, agency and OEM distribution partnerships. These third-party service providers and indirect sales partners, who are not in our control, may harm our reputation and damage our brand perception in the marketplace. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled sales and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. Also, marketing domain experts and enterprise sales professionals are very important to our success and are difficult to replace. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In particular, we have experienced a more competitive hiring environment in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we are headquartered. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock awards or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have in the past acquired, and we may in the future acquire businesses and technologies. For example, we acquired a small private company in December 2014, Insightera in December 2013 and Crowd Factory in April 2012 which we believe could strengthen or expand the functionality of our platform or provide access to new customers or markets. Acquisitions we make may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not the acquisition purchases are completed. We have limited experience in acquiring other businesses, and if we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate successfully the acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations or if we are unable to successfully integrate it, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nOur quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our marketing solution, which can make it difficult to achieve sequential revenue growth or could result in sequential revenue declines.\nWe have historically experienced seasonal variations in our signing of customer contracts and renewals. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers as well as renewal agreements with existing customers in the fourth quarter of each year as compared to any of the prior quarters. The first quarter and third quarter are typically the slowest in this regard. We expect this seasonality to continue in the future, which may cause fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics, and thus limit our ability to predict future results. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenue, because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract, which is typically one year, but ranges from one to three years. As a result, a slowdown in our ability to enter into customer agreements may not be apparent in our revenue for the quarter, as the revenue recognized in any quarter is primarily from customer agreements entered into in prior quarters. Historical patterns should not be considered indicative of our future sales activity or performance.\nIf we fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause our recent growth has resulted in the rapid expansion of our business, we do not have a long history upon which to base forecasts of future revenue. In addition, for our enterprise customers, the lengthy sales cycle for the evaluation and implementation of our solutions, which typically extends for several months, may also cause us to experience a delay between increasing operating expenses for such sales efforts, and, upon successful sales, the generation of corresponding revenue. Accordingly, we may be unable to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that we do not receive as a result of delays arising from these factors. As a result, our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, which could harm the price of our common stock.\nWe rely on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team, including Phillip M. Fernandez, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other key employees in\nthe areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers because of the complexity of our solutions. We may terminate any employee's employment at any time, with or without cause, and any employee may resign at any time, with or without cause. In addition, our executive officers and certain other management-level employees benefit from management retention agreements and/or a change in control acceleration policy in which an involuntary termination by us without cause or a voluntary termination by the employee for good reason, as such terms are defined in the agreements and policy, in connection with or one year after a change of control transaction, will result in severance pay and/or acceleration of equity vesting for the individual, which would increase the cost to us of any such departure. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our business.\nIf our marketing solution fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we do not correct any defect or other problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs.\nOur solutions and the systems infrastructure underlying our marketing platform are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. We have from time to time found defects in our solutions and may discover additional defects in the future. We may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before customers begin to use our solutions. Consequently, we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our solutions have been implemented. These defects or errors could also cause inaccuracies in the data we collect and process for our customers, or even the loss, damage or inadvertent release of customer data. We implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of defects or inaccuracies in the data we collect for our customers, or the loss, damage or inadvertent release of customer data could cause our reputation to be harmed, and customers may elect not to purchase or renew their agreements with us and subject us to service performance credits, warranty claims or increased insurance costs. The costs associated with any material defects or errors in our solutions or other performance problems may be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nThe standards and practices that entities use to regulate the use of email have in the past interfered with, and may in the future interfere with, the effectiveness of our solutions and our ability to conduct business.\nOur customers rely in part on email to communicate with their existing or prospective customers. Various entities, such as commercial email, antivirus and network security providers, attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation. These entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam. Some of these entities maintain \"blacklists\" of companies and individuals, and the websites, Internet service providers and Internet protocol addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate. If a company's Internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any Internet domain or Internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity's service or purchases its blacklist. Any of the foregoing restrictions or limitation on emails or internet addresses impacting our customers could lead to diminishing effectiveness of our marketing solutions, and, in turn, result in service problems and ultimately a reduction in renewals or loss of customers for us.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our marketing solutions with third-party applications that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline.\nThe functionality and popularity of our marketing solutions depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our solutions with third-party applications and platforms, including CRM, event management, e-commerce, call center, and social media sites that our customers use and from which they obtain data. Third-party providers of applications and APIs may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our solution, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our solutions with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use for marketing purposes, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and adversely impact our business.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality education and customer support, our business and reputation may suffer.\nHigh-quality education and customer support are important for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions and for the renewal of existing customers. Providing this education and support requires that our customer support personnel have specific marketing domain knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations due to the extensive training required. The importance of high quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and services to existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed.\nFuture product development is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new product offerings, applications and enhancements to our existing cloud-based marketing solutions. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop solutions internally due to certain constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors' research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could materially adversely affect our business.\nShifts over time in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solutions or changes in the components of our solutions purchased by our customers could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur strategy is to sell our marketing solutions to organizations of broadly different sizes, from SMBs to large enterprises. Our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our marketing solutions, including the sophistication and intensity of our customers' use of our solutions and the level of professional services and support required by a customer. For example, our enterprise customers typically require more professional services and because our professional services offerings typically have a higher cost of revenue than subscriptions to our solutions, any increase in sales of professional services would have an adverse effect on our overall gross margin and operating results. Providing professional services to enterprises allows us to utilize our\nstaff more efficiently than is the case in providing professional services to other customers or in other contexts; consequently, while an increase in providing professional services to enterprises typically hurts our overall gross margin, it may improve our professional services and other gross margin. Sales to enterprise customers may also entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts. Selling to SMB customers may involve smaller contract size, higher relative selling costs and greater credit risk and uncertainty. If the mix of organizations that purchase our solutions changes, or the mix of solution components purchased by our customer's changes, our gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain our thought leadership position in modern relationship marketing, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining our thought leadership position in modern relationship marketing is an important element in attracting new customers. We devote significant resources to develop and maintain our thought leadership position, with a focus on identifying and interpreting emerging trends in relationship marketing, shaping and guiding industry dialog, and creating and sharing the best marketing practices. Our activities related to developing and maintaining our thought leadership may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in such effort. We rely upon the continued services of our management and employees with domain expertise in modern relationship marketing to maintain our leadership position, and the loss of any key management or employees in this area could harm our competitive position and reputation. If we fail to successfully grow and maintain our thought leadership position, we may not attract new customers or retain our existing customers, and our business could suffer. In addition, we may incur expenses in our attempts to maintain our thought leadership position, which could affect our profitability and business.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some contract provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase.\nWe enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these\nagreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our solutions.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management's attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions, delay introductions of new solutions, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions, or injure our reputation.\nOur business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Companies in the software industry, including in marketing software, are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications and may assert patent or other intellectual property rights within the industry. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. From time to time, we may receive threatening letters or notices or may be the subject of claims that our solutions and underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. Responding to claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management's attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and cause us to incur significant expenses. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to redesign our application, delay releases, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, indemnify customers, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our solutions. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our customers may not purchase our marketing solutions if they are concerned that they may infringe third-party intellectual property rights. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn our subscription agreements with our customers, we agree to indemnify our customers against losses or costs incurred in connection with claims by a third party alleging that a customer's use of our services infringes the intellectual property rights of the third party. There can be no assurance that any existing limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate, or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Our customers who are accused of intellectual property infringement may in the future seek indemnification from us under the terms of our contracts. If such claims are successful, or if we are required to indemnify or defend our customers from these or other claims, these matters could be disruptive to our business and management and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on the continued participation and level of service of our third-party professional service providers and our indirect sales partners.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to provide certain services to us and/or our customers, as well as indirect sales partners to pursue additional channel, agency and OEM distribution partnerships. If any of these third-party service providers stop supporting our solution or if our network of providers does not expand, we will likely have to expand our internal team to meet the needs of our customers, which could increase our operating costs and result in lower gross margins. To the extent that we are unable to recruit alternative partners, or to expand our internal team, our revenue and operating results would be harmed.\nWe use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our marketing solutions and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our products, discontinue the sale of our products or take other remedial actions.\nEconomic uncertainties or downturns in the general economy or the industries in which our customers operate could disproportionately affect the demand for our marketing solutions and negatively impact our operating results.\nGeneral worldwide economic conditions have experienced a significant downturn and fluctuations in recent years, and market volatility and uncertainty remain widespread. As a result, we and our customers find it extremely difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. In addition, these conditions could cause our customers or prospective customers to reduce their marketing and sales budgets, which could decrease corporate spending on our marketing solutions, resulting in delayed and lengthened sales cycles, a decrease in new customer acquisition and/or loss of customers. Furthermore, during challenging economic times, our customers may face issues with their cash flows and in gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us, impact customer renewal rates and adversely affect our revenue. If such conditions occur, we may be required to increase our reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, and our operating results would be harmed. In addition, a downturn in the technology sector may disproportionately affect us because a significant portion of our customers are technology companies. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery, whether global, regional or within specific markets. If the conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen, our business could be harmed. In addition, even if the overall economy does not worsen or improves, the market for marketing software may not experience growth or we may not experience growth.\nExisting federal, state and foreign laws that regulate privacy rights, including online tracking, the sending of commercial emails and text messages, and other activities, could impact the use of our marketing solution and potentially subject us to regulatory enforcement or private litigation.\nCertain aspects of how our customers utilize our solution are subject to legislation and regulations in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere. These regulations and legislation seek,\namong other things, to allow consumers to have greater control over the collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected online and could therefore have a significant impact on the operation of our marketing solutions and could impair our attractiveness to customers, which would harm our business.\nMany of our customers and potential customers in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. These regulations may change the way these customers do business and may require us to implement additional features or offer additional contractual terms to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements, or could cause the demand for and sales of our marketing solutions to decrease and adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act) establishes certain requirements for senders of commercial email messages, such as providing recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender. The ability of our customers' message recipients to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of the email components of our marketing solutions. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act allows companies to send some types of commercial text messages only when the recipient has opted into the receipt of such text messages. In addition, certain states and foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada and the European Union, have enacted laws that regulate sending email, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation prohibits sending unsolicited email unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such email, or in other words has \"opted-in\" to receiving it. A requirement that recipients opt into, or the ability of recipients to opt out of, receiving commercial emails and texts may minimize the effectiveness of our solutions.\nIn addition, U.S., state and foreign jurisdictions are considering and may in the future enact legislation or laws restricting marketing activities in mobile, social and web channels. Any of the foregoing existing or future restrictions could require us to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers, or increase our operating costs or otherwise harm our business. We may be unable to pass along those costs to our clients in the form of increased subscription fees.\nWhile these laws and regulations generally govern our customers' use of our solution, we may face liability or reputational harm as a result of the activities of our customers, and we may be directly subject to certain laws as a data processor on behalf of, or as a business associate of, our customers. In addition, customers may engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law or the customers' own policies, which could subject us to liability or harm our reputation. If we were found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations as a result of government enforcement or private litigation, we could be subjected to civil and criminal sanctions, including both monetary fines and injunctive action that could force us to change our business practices, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business.\nPrivacy concerns and consumers' acceptance of Internet behavior tracking may limit the applicability, use and adoption of our marketing solutions.\nPrivacy concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better protect consumer privacy, but these measures may not alleviate all potential privacy concerns and threats. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the marketing and other industries are considering various new, additional or different\nself-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the foregoing laws, regulations, policies and actions may limit the use and adoption of our cloud-based marketing solutions and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance or loss of any such action.\nWe may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could harm our business.\nState, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to our subscription cloud-based marketing solutions in various jurisdictions is unclear. Further, these jurisdictions' rules regarding tax nexus are complex and vary significantly. As a result, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits, and our liability for these taxes and associated penalties could exceed our original estimates. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our application or otherwise harm our business and operating results.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers could increase the costs of our cloud-based marketing solutions and adversely impact our business.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing and potential future customers may elect not to continue or purchase our marketing solutions in the future. Additionally, new, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers' and our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our solutions. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nWe are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.\nAs a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.\nThe investment of our cash and cash equivalents including money market funds are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nOur investments include various money market funds which invest in securities such as United States Treasury securities, United States government agency securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit, liquidity, market prices and interest rates for these and other types of debt securities. Additionally, changes in monetary policy by the Federal Open Market Committee and concerns about the rising United States government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the United States dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio. Furthermore, if there is a default or downgrade of U.S. government or agency debt securities, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our liquidity, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management's attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nWe rely heavily on our data centers, network infrastructure and information technology systems for our business operations. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of online attack, earthquake, fire, terrorist attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other similar catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in accessing our service, reputational harm and loss of critical data or could prevent us from providing our solutions to our customers. We host our solutions at several facilities in the United States, the European Union, and Australia. We are headquartered and most of our employees reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area particularly susceptible to earthquakes, and a major earthquake or other catastrophic event could affect our employees, who may not be able to access our systems or otherwise continue to provide our solutions to our customers. We maintain a facility in Israel, and our operations there may be adversely affected by political instability or international conflict in that region. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers, or our network infrastructure or information technology systems, or access to our systems, could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our systems and resources, divert management's attention and be costly.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the recently enacted\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We are and will continue to be required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we rely on third-party software and system providers for meeting our reporting obligations and ensuring effective internal controls, and to the extent these third parties fail to provide adequate service including as a result of any inability to scale to handle our growth and the imposition of these increased reporting and internal controls and procedures, we could incur material costs for upgrading or switching systems and our business could be materially affected.\nAs a result of being a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the time and resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our annual report covering the year ending December 31, 2014. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner, particularly if material weaknesses or significant deficiencies persist. In the past certain significant deficiencies have been identified in our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial\nand other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Accounting for revenue from sales of subscriptions to software is particularly complex, is often the subject of intense scrutiny by the SEC, and will evolve as FASB continues to consider applicable accounting standards in this area.\nFor example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently working together with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow U.S. GAAP and those that are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In connection with this initiative, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in May 2014-Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\"-that supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. Although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it could change the way we account for the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer or for certain of our sales transactions. Adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption.\nIn addition, certain factors have in the past and may in the future cause us to defer recognition for subscription fees. For example, the inclusion in our customer contracts of material non-standard terms, such as acceptance criteria, could require the deferral of subscription revenue. To the extent that such contracts become more prevalent in the future our revenue may be adversely affected.\nBecause of these factors and other specific requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for revenue recognition, we must have very precise terms in our arrangements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver our hosting services or perform our professional services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend our sales cycle, and we may accept terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery.\nOur stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance resulting in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our stock.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including providers of software via the cloud-based model, have been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results, including as a result of the addition or loss of any number of customers;\n\u2022 announcements by us, our strategic partners or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022 failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in ratings and financial estimates and the publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of cloud- based software or other technology companies, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022 price and volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock and in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022 announcements by us with regard to the effectiveness of our internal controls and our ability to accurately report financial results;\n\u2022 new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business our industry;\n\u2022 lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022 changes in key personnel; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nIn the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or\nmore of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, current five percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds to invest in future growth opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nIn addition, certain holders of our common stock as of December 31, 2014 have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders.\nIn addition, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans have become eligible for sale in the public, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control\nof us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022 authorize \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022 provide for a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022 specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer or the president;\n\u2022 prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022 establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022 provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022 provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022 specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022 require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. In addition, any future financing or credit agreements may prohibit us from paying any type of dividends. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\", as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial disclosure obligations, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" We would cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" upon the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue; the date we qualify as a \"large accelerated filer,\" with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. Because we take advantage of some of these reduced reporting requirements, the information that we provide our security holders in future filings may be different than you might get from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.", "PERMNO": 13932, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MKTO"}
