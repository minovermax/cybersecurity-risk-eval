We have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

available for issuance.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, including our revenues, profitability and cash flow, may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly and annual results may decrease the value of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results include, without limitation:\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain and maintain FDA clearance and approval from foreign regulatory authorities for our products, and the timing of such clearances and approvals, particularly with respect to current and future generations of Pantheris and Ocelot product families;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our Lumivascular platform and products, including Pantheris and Ocelot;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of reimbursement for our Lumivascular platform products;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract new customers and increase the amount of business we generate from existing customers;\n\u25cf\nresults of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and success of new product and feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of costs and expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, political, industry and market conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe regulatory environment;\n\u25cf\nthe hiring, training and retention of key employees, including our sales team;\n\u25cf\nthe cost and potential outcomes of any litigation;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u25cf\nadvances and trends in new technologies and industry standards.\nWe have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each period since our inception in 2007. We incurred net losses of $19.0 million in 2020 and $19.5 million in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $367.3 million. These losses and our accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made to develop our Lumivascular platform and acquire customers.\nWe expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to make significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business. In addition, as a public company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability would negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization efforts or cause us to become insolvent.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, together with debt and financing activities and expected revenues from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements and fund our operations through 2022. Even though we received net proceeds of approximately $8.0 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of warrants during March and April of 2019, net proceeds of $3.8 million from the sales of our common stock in our August 2019 offering, $3.9 million from the sale of our common stock in our January 2020 offering, $2.3 million of loan proceeds in April 2020 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, $3.0 million from the sale of our common stock in April and May 2020, $5.5 million from the sale of our common stock in June and July 2020 $11.3 million from the sale of our common stock in August and September 2020, and approximately $13.0 million from the sale of our common stock in February 2021, we may need to raise additional funds through future equity or debt financings in the near future to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for product development, clinical trials and commercialization. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in raising funds pursuant to additional equity or debt financings or that such funds will be raised at prices that do not create substantial dilution for our existing stockholders. Given the volatility of our stock price, any financing that we undertake could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our products and net proceeds from the issuance of our preferred stock and debt financings, our initial public offering, or IPO, and our follow-on public offerings. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. We cannot be certain that additional capital will be available as needed on acceptable terms, or at all. In the future, we may require additional capital in order to (i) continue to conduct research and development activities, (ii) conduct post-market clinical studies, as well as clinical trials to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals necessary to commercialize our Lumivascular platform products, (iii) expand our sales and marketing infrastructure, (iv) acquire complementary businesses technologies or products; or (v) respond to business opportunities, challenges, a decline in sales, increased regulatory obligations or unforeseen circumstances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe degree of success we experience in commercializing our Lumivascular platform products, particularly Pantheris, and any future versions of such products;\n\u25cf\nthe costs, timing and outcomes of clinical trials and regulatory reviews associated with our future products;\n\u25cf\nthe costs and expenses of maintaining or expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and our manufacturing operations;\n\u25cf\nthe costs and timing of developing variations of our Lumivascular platform products and, if necessary, obtaining FDA clearance of such variations;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which our Lumivascular platform is adopted by hospitals for use by interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in the treatment of PAD;\n\u25cf\nthe number and types of future products we develop and commercialize;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of defending ourselves against future litigation;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u25cf\nthe extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses.\nWe may raise additional funds in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur additional debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. In addition, due to our current level of debt, future equity investors may require that we convert all or a portion of our debt to equity, and our debtholders may not agree to such terms. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, and/or if we convert all or a portion of our existing debt to equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, delay clinical trials necessary to market our products, delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products, and significantly scale back our operations, or we may become insolvent. If this were to occur, our ability to continue to grow and support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe have a significant amount of debt, which may adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial position and our ability to secure additional financing in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $11.1 million in principal, back-end fees and interest outstanding under a Term Loan Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with CRG Partners III L.P. and certain of its affiliated funds (collectively \u201cCRG\u201d). Our significant amount of debt may:\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on the Loan Agreement;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt obligations; and\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes on satisfactory terms or at all.\nThe existence of a substantial amount of debt may make it difficult for us to run our business effectively or raise the capital we need to continue our operations.\nCovenants under the Loan Agreement will restrict our business in many ways.\nThe Loan Agreement contains various covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur or assume liens;\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u25cf\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u25cf\npay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock or repay, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease, acquire or cancel debt prior to the stated maturity thereof;\n\u25cf\nmake loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries ability to create liens, or make or pay intercompany loans or advances;\n\u25cf\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nsell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets, including the capital stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf\ndissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another person.\nIn particular, the Loan Agreement, as amended in January 2021, includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum of $3.5 million of cash and certain cash equivalents, and we will have to achieve minimum revenues of $8.0 million in 2021, $10.0 million in 2022, $12.0 million in 2023, $14.5 million in 2024 and $17.0 million in 2025. If we fail to meet the applicable minimum revenue target in any calendar year, the Loan Agreement provides a cure right if we prepay a portion of the outstanding principal equal to 2.0 times the revenue shortfall. There can be no assurance as to our future compliance with the covenants under the Loan Agreement, as amended.\nThe covenants contained in the Loan Agreement could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategies by restricting our ability to make capital expenditures, engage in strategic acquisitions, refinance our outstanding indebtedness, or obtain additional financing. Such restrictions may make it difficult to plan for or react to changes in market conditions, such as future downturns in our business or the economy in general.\nIn addition, potential sources of equity financing may decline to invest in our company given the amount of debt and the rights that debt holders have to get paid before equity holders. In order to facilitate equity investments, future equity investors may require that we convert all or a portion of our debt to equity, and our debtholders may not agree to such terms. The amount of debt could therefore affect our ability to finance our company and prevent us from obtaining necessary operating capital as a result.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our Loan Agreement. If we default on payments or otherwise fail to comply with our obligations under our Loan Agreement, the lender may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facility and may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.\nBorrowings under our Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our personal property, including our intellectual property. The existing collateral pledged under the Loan Agreement may prevent us from being able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, or to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, comply with our debt covenants, or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash reserves and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to numerous risks, including the risks in this section, some of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash reserves or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, or that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, in the event of our breach of the Loan Agreement, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the Loan Agreement, the lender would be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due and, if they are not repaid, could foreclose upon our assets securing our obligations under the Loan Agreement.\nOur success depends in large part on a limited number of products, particularly Pantheris product family, all of which have a limited commercial history. If these products fail to gain, or lose, market acceptance, our business will suffer.\nOcelot, Ocelot PIXL, Ocelot MVRX, Tigereye, Lightbox, Wildcat, Kittycat 2, Pantheris and Pantheris SV are our only products currently cleared for sale, and our current revenues are wholly dependent on them. Sales of Wildcat and Kittycat 2 have declined and are continuing to decline as we focus on the promotion of our Lumivascular platform products. In addition, the long-term viability of our company is largely dependent on the successful commercialization and continued development of the Pantheris product family and we expect that sales of our other current and future Lumivascular platform products in the United States will account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our success depends on the continued and growing acceptance and use of Lumivascular platform products by the medical community.\nAll of our products have a limited commercial history. For example, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to commercialize Pantheris in October 2015 as well as a separate FDA clearance to market enhanced versions of Pantheris in March 2016 and May 2018 and those versions of Pantheris became commercially available in the United States and select international markets promptly thereafter. Pantheris SV launched in July 2019 after having received FDA clearance in April 2019. Tigereye launched in October 2020 after having received FDA clearance in September 2020. Our limited commercialization experience and number of approved products make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly-changing industries.\nOur ability to successfully market Lumivascular platform products will also be limited due to a number of factors including regulatory restrictions in our labeling. We cannot assure demand for Lumivascular platform products will continue to grow or that our products will significantly penetrate current or new markets. Market demand for our Lumivascular platform products and physician adoption of these products also may be negatively impacted by product performance issues and the need to replace certain products in accordance with our warranty policy. Utilization of our products has been less than we anticipated historically. If demand for our Lumivascular platform products does not increase and we cannot sell our products as planned, our financial results will be harmed. In addition, market acceptance may be hindered if physicians are not presented with compelling data from long-term studies of the safety and efficacy of our Lumivascular platform products compared to alternative procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery or other atherectomy procedures. For example, if patients undergoing treatment with our Lumivascular platform products have retreatment rates higher than or comparable with the retreatment rates of alternative procedures, it will be difficult to demonstrate the value of our Lumivascular platform products. Any studies we may conduct comparing our Lumivascular platform with alternative procedures will be expensive, time consuming and may not yield positive results. Physicians will also need to appreciate the value of real-time imaging in improving patient outcomes in order to change current methods for treating PAD patients. In addition, demand for our Lumivascular platform products may decline or may not increase as quickly as we expect. Failure of our Lumivascular platform products to significantly penetrate current or new markets, or our failure to successfully commercialize our products, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also aware of certain characteristics and features of our Lumivascular platform that may prevent widespread market adoption. For example, in procedures using the current model of Pantheris, some physicians may prefer to have a technician or second physician assisting with the operation of the catheter as well as a separate technician to operate the Lightbox, potentially making it less financially attractive for physicians and their hospitals and medical facilities. It may take significant time and expense to modify our products to allow a single physician to operate the entire system and we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to make such modifications or obtain any additional and necessary regulatory clearances for such modifications. Although the OCT images created by our Lightbox may make it possible for physicians to reduce the degree to which fluoroscopy and contrast dye are used when using our Lumivascular platform products compared to competing endovascular products, physicians are still using both fluoroscopy and contrast dye in these procedures. As a result, risks of complications from radiation and contrast dye are still present and may limit the commercial success of our products. Finally, it requires training of technicians and physicians to effectively operate our Lumivascular platform products, including interpreting the OCT images created by our Lightbox, which may affect adoption of our products by physicians.\nOur Lumivascular products are highly complex and the failure of relatively minor components could result in product failure or other significant performance issues that may not be discovered until after delivery to customers, which could give rise to claims from our customers or their patients. We have in the past, and may in the future, become aware of performance issues with our products. For example, prior to becoming commercially available on March 1, 2016, Pantheris had been used in clinical trials mainly in controlled situations. Since its commercialization and as more physicians have used Pantheris, we have received additional feedback on its performance, both positive and negative. We have attempted to address certain of these concerns with our current version of Pantheris. However, there can be no assurance that the changes and improvements will fully address the performance issues that have been raised by earlier versions of Pantheris. Our revenue has been adversely impacted by these product performance issues. We also had to incur additional expenses to make product changes and improvements, and to replace products in accordance with our warranty policy. If future product performance issues are not resolved and physician concerns not addressed, our reputation could suffer, which could lead to decreased sales of our products.\nWe rely heavily on our sales professionals to market and sell our products. If we are unable to hire, effectively train, manage, improve the productivity of, and retain our sales professionals, our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to hire, train, manage and improve the productivity levels of our sales professionals. We have experienced turnover of our sales professionals in the past. The loss of any member of our sales team\u2019s senior management could weaken our sales expertise and harm our business, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. The changes in senior management that have occurred over the past several years may continue to create instability in our sales force leading to attrition in sales representatives in the future.\nCompetition for sales professionals who are familiar with and trained to sell our products continues to be strong. We train our sales professionals to better understand our existing and new product technologies and how they can be positioned against our competitors\u2019 products. These initiatives are intended to improve the productivity of our sales professionals and our revenue and profitability. It takes time for the sales professionals to become productive following their hiring and training and there can be no assurance that sales representatives will reach adequate levels of productivity, or that we will not experience significant levels of attrition in the future. Measures we implement to improve the productivity may not be successful and may instead cause additional departures from our sales organization, or further reduce our revenue, profitability, and harm our business and our stock price may be adversely impacted as a result.\nOur ability to compete is highly dependent on demonstrating the benefits of our Lumivascular platform to physicians, hospitals and patients and our ability to innovate new and improved products.\nIn order to generate sales, we must be able to clearly demonstrate that our Lumivascular platform is a more effective treatment system than the alternatives offered by our competitors. If we are unable to convince physicians that our Lumivascular platform leads to significantly lower rates of restenosis, or narrowing of the artery, and leads to fewer adverse events during treatment than those using competing technologies, our business will suffer. We must convince hospitals and physicians that our Lumivascular platform results in significantly better patient outcomes at a competitive overall cost. For example, we may need to demonstrate that the investment hospitals must make if purchasing our Lightbox and the incremental costs of having a technician or a second individual operate Pantheris can be justified based on the benefits to patients, physicians and hospitals. If we are unable to develop robust clinical data to support these claims, we will be unable to convince hospitals and third-party payors of these benefits and our business will suffer.\nOur value proposition to physicians and hospitals is largely dependent upon our contention that the rate of arterial damage when physicians are using our imaging products is lower than with non-imaging competing products. If minimizing arterial damage does not significantly impact patient outcomes, meaning either (i) that restenosis is often triggered without disrupting healthy arterial structures or (ii) arteries can be damaged during treatment without triggering restenosis, then we may be unable to demonstrate our Lumivascular platform\u2019s benefits are any different than competing technologies. Furthermore, physicians may find our imaging system difficult to use, and we may not be able to provide physicians with adequate training to be able to realize the benefits of our Lumivascular platform. If physicians do not value the benefits of on-board imaging and the enhanced visualization enabled by our products during an endovascular intervention as compared to our competitors\u2019 products, or do not believe that such benefits improve clinical outcomes, our Lumivascular platform products may not be widely adopted.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must also continue to develop new product offerings and enhancements to our existing Lumivascular platform products. The market for medical devices in general, and in the PAD market in particular, is highly competitive, dynamic, and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. If we are unable to innovate successfully, our Lumivascular platform products could become obsolete and our revenues would decline as our customers purchase our competitors\u2019 products. In addition, our innovation efforts may not result in new products that generate additional revenue. For example, we believe that our next-generation Pantheris and Pantheris SV are important to our future revenues, and we are devoting a significant portion of our resources to their continued development. However, we do not yet know whether these or any other new offerings will be well received and broadly accepted by physicians, and if so, whether sales will be sufficient for us to offset costs of development, implementation, support, operation, sales and marketing. Additionally, new products may subject us to additional risks of product performance, market adoption, customer complaints and litigation. If sales of our new product offerings, including are lower than we expect, fail to gain anticipated market acceptance or cause us to expend additional resources to fix unforeseen problems and develop modifications, our revenues and results of operations may not improve and our business will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop, market, and sell our products depends in part upon our working relationships with physicians, and any events that damage those relationships, or make it more difficult to build and maintain those relationships, could harm our business.\nThe development, marketing, and sale of our products depends upon our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us in clinical trials and as researchers, marketing and product consultants and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, state attorneys general, and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Changes to or our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations governing our relationships with physicians, or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, DOJ, state attorneys general and other government agencies, could significantly harm our business by damaging our reputation among, or restricting our ability to work with, physicians.\nIn addition, we target our sales efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists because they are often the physicians diagnosing and treating both coronary artery disease and PAD. If these physicians are not made aware of our Lumivascular platform products, those patients may instead be surgically treated or treated with an alternative interventional procedure. In addition, there is a significant correlation between PAD and coronary artery disease, and many physicians do not routinely screen for PAD while screening for coronary artery disease. If we are not successful in educating physicians about screening for PAD and about the capabilities of our Lumivascular platform products, our ability to increase our revenues may be impaired.\nWe compete against companies that have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration, increasing our revenues or becoming profitable.\nOur products compete with a variety of products and devices for the treatment of PAD, including other CTO crossing devices, stents, balloons and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Large competitors in the CTO crossing, stent and balloon markets include Abbott Laboratories, AngioDyamics, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Cook Medical, Becton Dickinson and Medtronic. Competitors in the atherectomy market include AngioDyamics, Boston Scientific, Cardiovascular Systems, Medtronic and Philips. Some competitors have previously attempted to combine intravascular imaging with atherectomy and may have current programs underway to do so. These and other companies may attempt to incorporate on-board visualization into their products in the future and may remain competitive with us in marketing traditional technologies. Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of symptoms associated with mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. These competitors and other companies may introduce new products that compete with our products. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and have well-established reputations, as well as broader product offerings and worldwide distribution channels that are significantly larger and more effective than ours. In addition, competitors with greater financial resources than ours could acquire other companies to gain enhanced name recognition and market share, as well as new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing products, which may cause our revenues to decline and would harm our business. Competition with these companies could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively differentiate our products or company from those of our competitors and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf our manufacturing facility becomes damaged or inoperable, or we are required to vacate the facility, or our electronic systems are compromised, our ability to manufacture and sell our Lumivascular platform products and to pursue our research and development efforts may be jeopardized.\nWe currently manufacture and assemble our Lumivascular platform products in-house. Our products are comprised of components sourced from a variety of contract manufacturers, with final assembly completed at our facility in Redwood City, California. Our facility and equipment, or those of our suppliers, could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, earthquake, terrorism, flooding and power outages. Further, our electronic systems may experience service interruptions, denial-of-service and other cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other events. Any of these may render it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture products, pursue our research and development efforts or otherwise run our business for some period of time. If our facility is inoperable for even a short period of time, the inability to manufacture our current products, and the interruption in research and development of any future products, may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. Furthermore, it could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work and manufacture our products.\nWe depend on third-party vendors to manufacture some of our components, coating and sub-assemblies, including some single source suppliers, which could make us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could harm our business.\nWe currently manufacture some of our components and sub-assemblies at our Redwood City facility and rely on third-party vendors for other components and sub-assemblies used in our Lumivascular platform. For several of our components and sub-assemblies we rely on single and limited source suppliers. For example, we rely on single vendors for our optical fiber, coatings and drive cables that are key components of our catheters, and we rely on single vendors for our laser and data acquisition card that are key components of our Lightbox. These components are critical to our products and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We do not carry a significant inventory of these components. Our reliance on third-party vendors subjects us to a number of risks that could impact our ability to manufacture our products and harm our business, including:\n\u25cf\ninterruption of supply resulting from modifications to, or discontinuation of, a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf\ndelays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s failure to consistently produce quality components;\n\u25cf\nprice fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers for key components;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty identifying and qualifying alternative or additional suppliers for components in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\ninability of the manufacturer or supplier to comply with QSR as enforced by the FDA and state regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\ninability to control the quality of products manufactured by third parties;\n\u25cf\nproduction delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications; and\n\u25cf\ndelays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers.\nAny significant delay or interruption in the supply of components or sub-assemblies, or our inability to obtain substitute components, sub-assemblies or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and harm our business.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.\nOur success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive management team and key employees and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could harm us and directly impact our financial results. Our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. Changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives could disrupt our business.\nWe must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing medical devices and for sales professionals. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages. In addition, job candidates and existing employees, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business would be harmed.\nWe do not currently intend to devote significant additional resources in the near-term to market our Lumivascular platform internationally, which will limit our potential revenues from our Lumivascular platform products.\nMarketing our Lumivascular platform outside of the United States would require substantial additional sales and marketing, regulatory and personnel expenses. As part of our product development and regulatory strategy, we plan to expand into select international markets, but we do not currently intend to devote significant additional resources to market our Lumivascular platform internationally in order to focus our resources and efforts on the U.S. market. Our decision to market our products primarily in the United States in the near-term will limit our ability to reach all of our potential markets and will limit our potential sources of revenue. In addition, our competitors will have an opportunity to further penetrate and achieve market share outside of the United States until such time, if ever, that we devote significant additional resources to market our Lumivascular platform products or other products internationally.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, due to prior period losses of $317.9 million and $209.7 million, respectively, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2027 for federal purposes and 2027 for state purposes. Out of the total Federal net operating loss carryforwards, $43.5 million were generated post December 31, 2017 and have no expiration. Generally, subject to certain limitations, NOLs can be used to offset taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may limit the NOLs we may use in any year for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes in ownership of our company. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. It is possible that prior transactions with respect to our stock may have caused, and that future issuances or sales of our stock (including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could cause, an \u201cownership change.\u201d A number of our common and preferred stock financings over the past year may affect our ability to use NOLs. If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income, potentially increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused. Any limitation on using NOLs could (depending on the extent of such limitation and the NOLs previously used) result in our retaining less cash after payment of U.S. federal income taxes during any year in which we have taxable income (rather than losses) than we would be entitled to retain if such NOLs were available as an offset against such income for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes, which could harm our profitability. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, was enacted into law with many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. The Tax Act limits the utilization of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income per year. However, existing NOLs that arose in years prior to December 31, 2017 are not affected by these provisions. Our ability to utilize NOLs arising in future tax periods may be limited by the Tax Act.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto have adversely affected and we expect will continue to adversely affect our supply chain, workforce, approval process, and business operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, SARS-CoV-2, and the resulting disease COVID-19 has spread to multiple countries, including the United States and all of the primary markets where we conduct business. On March 10, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the U.S. government-imposed restrictions on travel between the United States and Europe for a 30-day period. Further, on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, invoking powers under the Stafford Act, the legislation that directs federal emergency disaster response. Almost all U.S. states and many local jurisdictions have issued, and others in the future may issue, \"shelter-in-place\" orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders, restrictions, and recommendations for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders, restrictions and recommendations, and the perception that additional orders, restrictions or recommendations could occur, have resulted in widespread closures of businesses not deemed \u201cessential,\u201d work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, as well as record declines in stock prices, among other effects. We continue to monitor our operations and government mandates and may elect or be required to temporarily close our offices to protect our employees, and limit our access to customers and limit customer use of our products as they are required to prioritize resources to address the public healthcare needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruptions to our activities and operations will negatively impact our business, some of our operating results and may negatively impact our financial condition. There is a risk that government actions will not be effective at containing COVID-19, and that government actions, including the orders and restrictions described above, that are intended to contain the spread of COVID-19 will have a devastating negative impact on the world economy at large, in which case the risks to our sales, operating results and financial condition described herein would be elevated significantly.\nThe duration of COVID-19's impact on our business may be difficult to assess or predict. The widespread pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result for an extended period, in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which would negatively affect our liquidity. Further, quarantines or government reaction or shutdowns could disrupt our supply chain. Travel and import restrictions may also disrupt our ability to manufacture or distribute our devices. Any import or export or other cargo restrictions related to our products or the raw materials used to manufacture our products would restrict our ability to manufacture and ship products and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our key personnel and other employees could also be affected by COVID-19, potentially reducing their availability, and an outbreak such as COVID-19 or the procedures we take to mitigate its effect on our workforce could reduce the efficiency of our operations or prove insufficient. We may delay or reduce certain spending related to certain projects until the travel and logistical impacts related to COVID-19 are lifted, which will delay the completion of such projects.\nIn addition, the conduct of clinical trials required to obtain clearance of additional indications and studies gathering post-market data for some of our products previously cleared by the FDA have been, and we expect may continue to be, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, site initiation and patient enrollment have been delayed for one of our clinical studies, and we are experiencing delays in completing the INSIGHT clinical study with the current restrictions on clinical work. As hospital resources are prioritized for the COVID-19 outbreak and quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, these and other clinical studies may continue to be disrupted. If we are unable to successfully complete these or other clinical studies, and thus obtain regulatory approvals and efficacy data sought, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nWhile certain jurisdictions have begun easing restrictions on performing elective procedures, we cannot be certain that other jurisdictions will do so, or that, once hospitals do begin easing restrictions on elective procedures, patients will begin requesting such procedures. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have experienced and continue to experience a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, which has prompted certain hospitals and other medical providers in such areas to again defer elective procedures or further prolong or reinstate restrictions on such procedures. If other jurisdictions experience a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, they may also prolong or reinstate restrictions on elective procedures. We have already experienced reduced sales as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic causing deferrals of elective procedures. While we experienced a rebound in sales during the third quarter of 2020 as practitioners and hospitals began to once again perform elective procedures, it is unclear whether our sales will continue to increase and whether sales lost earlier in the year may be recoverable in the future. If our sales decline, or if such lost sales are not recoverable in the future, our business and results of operations will be significantly adversely affected.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change, and its duration and extent depends on factors such as the evolution of variants of the virus, and the development and widespread distribution of vaccines. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects have harmed our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the near term and could have a continuing material impact on our operations, sales, and ability to continue operations.\nCustomer demand for and our ability to sell and market our products have been and we expect will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto.\nRestrictions on the ability to travel, social distancing policies, orders and restrictions, including those described above, and recommendations and fears of COVID-19 spreading within medical centers has caused both patients and providers to delay or cancel procedures that use our devices. We are unable to accurately predict when these policies, orders and restrictions will be relaxed or lifted, and there can be no assurances that patients or providers will restart procedures that use our devices upon termination of these policies, orders and restrictions, particularly if there remains any continued community outbreak of COVID-19. A prolonged economic contraction or recession may also result in employer layoffs of their employees in markets where we conduct business, which could result in lower procedure demand.\nOur sales and marketing personnel often rely on in-person and onsite access to healthcare providers which is currently restricted as hospitals reduce access to essential personnel only. These restrictions have harmed our sales and marketing efforts, and continued restrictions would have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations. An increase of COVID-19-related hospital admissions may overload hospitals with unexpected patients, thereby delaying further procedures that use our devices but that are deemed elective by the hospital. In addition, we made temporary salary and work hour reductions, though we have reverted salaries and hours to prior levels, we and may, in the future, take further actions including reinstating reductions to salary and work hours, furloughs, restructuring or layoffs, which may negatively impact our workforce and our business.\nWe may not be eligible to participate in the relief programs provided under the recently adopted Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and even if we are eligible we may not realize any material benefits from participating in such programs.\nOn March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. We are evaluating the applicability of the CARES Act to the Company, and the potential impacts on our business. We applied for, and received, a loan (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) in the principal amount of $2.3 million under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) of the Cares Act. The PPP Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 1% annually and matures on April 20, 2022. Under the terms of the PPP, the principal may be forgiven if the Loan proceeds are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act, such as payroll costs, benefits, rent, and utilities. In addition, on June 5, 2020, the President of the United States signed the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the \u201cPPPFA\u201d) into law. The PPPFA gives borrowers of a PPP loan more flexibility and time to spend the loan proceeds and allows the funds to be used on broader categories of expenses while still qualifying for loan forgiveness. We are evaluating forgiveness requirements pursuant to the PPP and PPPFA but can provide no guarantee that we will meet any of the requirements for loan forgiveness. However, no assurance can be provided that the Company will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan in whole or in part. While we may determine to apply for additional programs available under the CARES Act or other similar programs, there is no guarantee that we will meet any eligibility requirements to participate in such programs or, even if we are able to participate, that such programs will provide meaningful benefit to our business.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our recently received PPP Loan, and our application for the PPP Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible or could result in damage to our reputation.\nOn April 23, 2020 we received proceeds of $2.3 million from a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, a portion of which may be forgiven, which we used to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan matures on April 20, 2022 and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Commencing on the date that is the later of (i) the date that is the 10th month after the end of the Company\u2019s PPP Loan covered period (as described below) and assuming the Company has applied for PPP Loan forgiveness within the period described in clause, which it did in December 2020 (ii), the date on which SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount on the Company\u2019s PPP Loan to the PPP lender (or notifies such lender that no loan forgiveness is allowed), we are required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize by April 20, 2022 any principal amount outstanding on the PPP Loan as of October 21, 2020. On June 5, 2020, the President of the United States signed the PPPFA into law. The PPPFA gives borrowers of a PPP loan more flexibility and time to spend the loan proceeds and allows the funds to be used on broader categories of expenses while still qualifying for loan forgiveness. A portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven by the SBA upon our application and upon documentation of expenditures in accordance with the SBA requirements. Under the CARES Act and the PPPFA, loan forgiveness is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the twenty-four week period or, if elected by the Company, the eight week period beginning on the date of the loan is advanced. Not more than 40% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs. The amount of the PPP Loan eligible to be forgiven may be limited due to declines in headcount, whether voluntary or involuntary, or if salaries and wages for employees with salaries of $100,000 or less annually are reduced by more than 25% as compared to the period of January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, in accordance with the amortization schedule described above, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness, that we will ultimately apply for forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. Furthermore, on April 28, 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury stated that the SBA will perform a full review of any PPP loan over $2.0 million before forgiving the loan.\nIn order to apply for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation and access to alternative forms of capital, and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act. The certification described above does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. On April 23, 2020, the SBA issued guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program has resulted in significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good-faith belief that given our Company's circumstances we satisfied all eligible requirements for the PPP Loan, we are later determined to have violated any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan, such as the False Claims Act, or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties and could be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety. In addition, receipt of a PPP Loan may result in adverse publicity and damage to reputation, and a review or audit by the SBA or other government entity or claims under the False Claims Act could consume significant financial and management resources. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies or be the target of strategic transactions, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, applications or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our Lumivascular platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target or obtain the expected benefits of any acquisition or investment.\nTo date, our technology and product development efforts have been organic, and we have no experience in acquiring other businesses. In any acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the use of our available cash, or the incurrence of debt, which could harm our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nIn addition, we sometimes receive inquiries relating to potential strategic transactions, including from third parties who may seek to acquire us. We will continue to consider and discuss such transactions as we deem appropriate. Such potential transactions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating and evaluating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\nRisks Related to Our Use of Technology and Intellectual Property\nIf our technology infrastructure is compromised, damaged or interrupted by a cybersecurity incident, data security breach or other security problems, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems. Cybersecurity incidents can include computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage.\nIn addition, our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss and telecommunications failures. Any such disruption to our systems, or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated, or the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, could require us to notify affected individuals, federal or state agencies or media outlets of the incident and could result in business disruption, negative publicity, loss of customers, potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, and competitive disadvantage, any or all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits. Moreover, a cybersecurity breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in a disruption of our operations.\nWhile we have invested, and continue to invest, in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, as well as disaster recovery plans, these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations.\nWe may in the future be a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our Lumivascular platform products.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products, or that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties\u2019 trade secrets. Additionally, our products include hardware and software components that we purchase from vendors, and may include design components that are outside of our direct control. Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios, trade secrets, trademarks, and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell and/or export our products or to use product names. They may devote substantial resources towards obtaining claims that cover the design of our atherectomy products to prevent the marketing and selling of competitive products. We may become a party to patent or trademark infringement or trade secret claims and litigation as a result of these and other third-party intellectual property rights being asserted against us. The defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming. Vendors from whom we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third-party\u2019s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third-party\u2019s trade secret.\nFurther, if such patents, trademarks, or trade secrets are successfully asserted against us, this may harm our business and result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products, license fees, damages and the payment of attorney fees and court costs. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties. Although patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our Lumivascular platform products to avoid infringement.\nSimilarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as re-examination, inter partes review, or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or other jurisdictional body relating to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our Lumivascular platform products or using product names, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents or trademarks, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. We may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that are the same or similar to our products or from using product names that are the same or similar to our product names, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe are aware of patents held by third parties that may be asserted against us in litigation that could be costly and could limit our ability to sell our Lumivascular platform products.\nWe are aware of patent families related to catheter positioning, optical coherence tomography, occlusion cutting and atherectomy owned by third parties. With regard to atherectomy patents, one of our founders, Dr. John Simpson, founded FoxHollow Technologies prior to founding our company. FoxHollow Technologies developed an atherectomy device that is currently sold by Medtronic, and Dr. Simpson and our Chief Technology Officer, Himanshu Patel, are listed as inventors on patents covering that device that are now held by Medtronic. We are not currently aware of any claims Medtronic has made or intends to make against us with respect to Pantheris or any other product or product under development. Because of a doctrine known as \u201cassignor estoppel,\u201d if any of Dr. Simpson\u2019s earlier patents are asserted against us by Medtronic, we may be prevented from asserting an invalidity defense regarding those patents, and our defense may be compromised. Medtronic has significantly greater financial resources than we do to pursue patent litigation and could assert these patent families against us at any time. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could prevent us from manufacturing or selling Pantheris or other products or products under development, which would significantly harm our business.\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2020, we held 38 issued and allowed U.S. patents, 1 U.S. pending provisional application, 23 U.S. utility patent applications and 2 PCT applications pending. As of December 31, 2020, we also had 75 issued and allowed patents from outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we had 40 pending patent applications outside of the United States, including in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan and Mexico. Our patents and patent applications include claims covering key aspects of the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of OCT imaging catheters, occlusion-crossing catheters, atherectomy devices and our imaging console. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. Should such challenges be successful, competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors or former or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand to international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology. To the extent our intellectual property protection is incomplete, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. In addition, competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our Lumivascular platform, brand and business.\nWe use certain open source software in Lightbox. We may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products or from open source licensors, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to cease offering Lightbox unless and until we can re-engineer it to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. These risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our Lumivascular platform products, or if clearances or approvals for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed.\nOur Lumivascular platform products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by FDA in the United States and by regulatory agencies in other countries where we do business. Government regulations specific to medical devices are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u25cf\nproduct design, development and manufacture;\n\u25cf\nlaboratory, preclinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution;\n\u25cf\npre-marketing clearance or approval;\n\u25cf\nrecord keeping;\n\u25cf\nproduct marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution; and\n\u25cf\npost-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals.\nBefore a new medical device, or a new intended use for, an existing product can be marketed in the United States, a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance or pre-marketing approval from FDA, unless an exemption applies. Either process can be expensive, lengthy and unpredictable. We may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the product, which may limit the market for the product. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearance to market our Pantheris family of catheters for atherectomy, and our Ocelot family of catheters for crossing sub and total occlusions in the peripheral vasculature, our clearance can be revoked if safety or efficacy problems develop. Delays in obtaining clearance or approval could increase our costs and harm our revenues and growth.\nIn addition, we are required to timely file various reports with the FDA, including medical device reports, or MDRs, if our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If these MDRs are not filed timely, regulators may impose sanctions and sales of our products may suffer, and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our business.\nIf we initiate a correction or removal for one of our devices to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required to submit a publicly available Correction and Removal report to the FDA and in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall that could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our devices. Furthermore, the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation.\nThe FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there are adequate and reasonable scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including Warning Letters, adverse publicity, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.\nThe FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include, among other things, harm to our reputation; fines, injunctions, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution; product replacements or recalls; or rejecting our requests for future 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval or withdrawal of a previously granted 510(k) clearance. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial condition would be harmed.\nMaterial modifications to our Lumivascular platform products may require new 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our Lumivascular platform products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nMaterial modifications to the intended use or technological characteristics of our Lumivascular platform products will require new 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained if such changes were made via the \u201cLetter-to-File\u201d process of internal documentation. Based on published FDA guidelines, the FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision. Any modification to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our Lumivascular platform products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining required future clearances would harm our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. We have made modifications to our Lumivascular platform products in the past and will make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our Lumivascular platform products as modified, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our Lumivascular platform products. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions. Future versions of are Lumivacular platform incorporating enhancements may require additional regulatory clearances or approvals.\nOur ability to market our current products in the United States is limited to use in peripheral vessels, and if we want to market our products for other uses, we will need to file for FDA clearances or approvals and may need to conduct trials to support expanded use, which would be expensive, time-consuming and may not be successful.\nOur current products are cleared in the United States only for crossing sub-total and chronic total occlusions and for performing atherectomy in the peripheral vasculature. These FFDCA clearances prohibits us from marketing or advertising our products for any other indication within the peripheral vasculature, which restricts our ability to sell these products and could affect our growth. Additionally, our products are contraindicated for use in the cerebral, carotid, coronary, iliac, and renal arteries. While off-label use of medical devices is common and the FDA does not regulate physicians\u2019 choice of treatments, the FDA does restrict a manufacturer\u2019s communications regarding such off-label use. We are not allowed to actively promote or advertise our products for off-label use. In addition, we cannot make comparative claims regarding the use of our products against any alternative treatments without conducting head-to-head comparative clinical studies, which would be expensive and time consuming. If our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings or enforcement action by the FDA and other government agencies. In the future, if we want to market a variation of Ocelot or Pantheris product families in the United States for use in other applications for which we do not currently have clearance, such as the coronary arteries, we will need to make modifications to these products, conduct further clinical trials and obtain new clearances or approvals from the FDA. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these modifications, that future clinical studies will be successful or that the expense of these activities will be offset by additional revenues.\nIf our clinical trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, our business may be harmed.\nClinical development is a long, expensive, and uncertain process and is subject to delays and the risk that products may ultimately prove unsafe or ineffective in treating the indications for which they are designed. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and failure of the trial can occur at any time. We cannot provide any assurance that our clinical trials will meet their primary endpoints or that such trials or their results will be accepted by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Even if we achieve positive early or preliminary results in clinical trials, these results do not necessarily predict final results, and positive results in early trials may not indicate success in later trials. Many companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials or in the preliminary results from these late-stage clinical trials.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or because of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory clearance or approval for new products or modifications of existing products, including new indications for existing products, including:\n\u25cf\nnegative or inconclusive results that may cause us to decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing which may be expensive and time consuming;\n\u25cf\ntrial results that do not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\nfindings by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities that the product is not sufficiently safe for investigational use in humans;\n\u25cf\ninterpretations of data from preclinical testing and clinical testing by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities that may be different from our own;\n\u25cf\ndelays or failure to obtain approval of our clinical trial protocols from the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining institutional review board approvals or government approvals to conduct clinical trials at prospective sites;\n\u25cf\nfindings by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities that our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or facilities are unsatisfactory;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the review policies of the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities or the adoption of new regulations that may negatively affect or delay our ability to bring a product to market or receive approvals or clearances to treat new indications;\n\u25cf\ntrouble in managing multiple clinical sites;\n\u25cf\ndelays in agreeing on acceptable terms with third-party research organizations and trial sites that may help us conduct the clinical trials; and\n\u25cf\nthe suspension or termination by us, or regulators, of our clinical trials because the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nFailures or perceived failures in our clinical trials will delay and may prevent our product development and regulatory approval process, damage our business prospects and negatively affect our reputation and competitive position.\nFrom time to time, we engage outside parties to perform services related to certain of our clinical studies and trials, and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could increase costs and cause delays.\nFrom time to time, we engage consultants to help design, monitor, and analyze the results of certain of our clinical studies and trials. The consultants we engage interact with clinical investigators to enroll patients in our clinical trials. We depend on these consultants and clinical investigators to help facilitate the clinical studies and trials and monitor and analyze data from these studies and trials under the investigational plan and protocol for the study or trial and in compliance with applicable regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices. We may face delays in our regulatory approval process if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely, compliant or competent manner. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for other reasons, our clinical studies or trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may otherwise prove to be unsuccessful, and we may have to conduct additional studies, which would significantly increase our costs, in order to obtain the regulatory clearances that we need to commercialize our products.\nWe have limited long-term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our Lumivascular platform products, including Pantheris. Any long-term data that is generated by clinical trials involving our Lumivascular platform may not be positive or consistent with our short-term data, which would harm our ability to obtain clearance to market and sell our products.\nOur Lumivascular platform is a novel system, and our success depends on its acceptance by the medical community as being safe and effective, and improving clinical outcomes. Important factors upon which the efficacy of our Lumivascular platform products, including Pantheris, will be measured are long-term data on the rate of restenosis following our procedure, and the corresponding duration of patency, or openness of the artery, and publication of that data in peer-reviewed journals. Another important factor that physicians will consider is the rate of reintervention, or retreatment, following the use of our Lumivascular platform products. The long-term clinical benefits of procedures that use our Lumivascular platform products are not known.\nThe results of short-term clinical experience of our Lumivascular platform products do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefit. Restenosis rates typically increase over time. We believe that physicians will compare the rates of long-term restenosis and reintervention for procedures using our Lumivascular platform products against alternative procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery and other atherectomy procedures. If the long-term rates of restenosis and reintervention do not meet physicians\u2019 expectations, our Lumivascular platform products may not become widely adopted and physicians may consider alternative treatments for their patients. Another significant factor that physicians will consider is acute safety data on complications that occur during the use of our Lumivascular platform products. If the results obtained from any post-market studies that we conduct or post-clearance surveillance indicate that the use of our Lumivascular platform products are not as safe or effective as other treatment options or as current short-term data would suggest, adoption of our product may suffer and our business would be harmed. In addition, we are responsible for the costs associated with conducting studies to obtain safety and efficacy data. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing, whether through our operations or from third parties, we will not be able to conduct the studies necessary to obtain long-term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our products.\nEven if we believe the data collected from clinical studies or clinical experience indicate positive results, each physician\u2019s actual experience with our products will vary. Physicians who are technically proficient participate in our clinical trials and are high-volume users of our Lumivascular platform products. Consequently, the results of our clinical trials and their experiences using our products may lead to better patient outcomes than those of physicians that are less proficient, perform fewer procedures or who use our products infrequently.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, our manufacturing operations could be delayed or shut down and Lumivascular platform sales could suffer.\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our Lumivascular platform products. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we fail a QSR inspection, our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in, among other things, a shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our device, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our products and cause our revenues to decline.\nWe have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Our current facility has been inspected by the FDA in 2009, 2011 and 2013, and two, three and zero observations, respectively, were noted during those inspections. BSI, our European Notified Body, inspected our facility in 2014 and 2015 and found zero non-conformances. BSI conducted four external audits in 2016 and zero non-conformances were found in all except for one audit, for which four minor non-conformances were found. BSI conducted a recertification audit (for EU) in 2016 followed by surveillance audits in 2017 & 2018, and found no major non-conformances. BSI also audited us for QSR compliance under MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) for FDA in July 2016, and found no major non-conformances. Additionally, BSI conducted a Technical File Audit in 2018 that resulted in one major non-conformance and three minor non-conformances. In 2018 and 2019, BSI conducted multiple routine audits including a surveillance audit, a Microbiology audit, a MDSAP re-certification audit and most recently, a one-day unannounced audit in September 2019. During 2020, we underwent a BSI conducted a MDSAP surveillance audit which resulted in one minor non-conformance and no major non-conformances. In January 2021, BSI conducted a Microbiology audit which resulted in zero non-conformances. All non-conformances identified in the aforementioned audits have been either successfully resolved or are being actively addressed via Avinger\u2019s CAPA system.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will continue to remain in substantial compliance with the QSR. If the FDA, CDPH or BSI inspect our facility and discover major compliance problems, we may have to shut down our facility and cease manufacturing until we can take the appropriate remedial steps to correct the audit findings. Taking corrective action may be expensive, time consuming and a distraction for management and if we experience a shutdown or delay at our manufacturing facility we may be unable to produce our Lumivascular platform products, which would harm our business.\nOur Lumivascular platform products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation.\nFDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects. Recalls of our Lumivascular platform products or products we commercialize in the future would divert managerial attention, be expensive, harm our reputation with customers and harm our financial condition and results of operations. A recall announcement would negatively affect our stock price.\nChanges in coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our Lumivascular platform products could affect the adoption of our Lumivascular platform and our future revenues.\nCurrently, our Lumivascular platform procedure is typically reimbursed by third-party payors, including Medicare and private healthcare insurance companies, under existing reimbursement codes. These payors may change their coverage and reimbursement policies, as well as payment amounts, in a way that would prevent or limit reimbursement for our products, which would significantly harm our business. Also, healthcare reform legislation or regulation may be proposed or enacted in the future, which may adversely affect such policies and amounts. We cannot predict whether and to what extent existing coverage and reimbursement will continue to be available. If physicians, hospitals and other providers are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed using our Lumivascular platform products, they are significantly less likely to use our Lumivascular platform products and our business would be harmed.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our planned products\u2019 commercial success.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could harm our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. The current presidential administration and Congress may continue to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current healthcare laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the medical device industry as a whole is currently unknown. Any changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may harm:\n\u25cf\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u25cf\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of capital.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEven though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to many healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that affect how we operate include:\n\u25cf\nthe federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government;\n\u25cf\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf\nthe Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the HHS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf\nHIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, which protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u25cf\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nThe Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the clearance or approval and commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nOur research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the safe storage, use, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous substances and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances, such as isopropyl alcohol and other solvents. In addition, our research and development may acquire biological waste materials, such as human and animal tissue, for the sole use of product design testing. Upon completion of the product testing, these biological wastes are safely disposed of following all federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These operations are permitted by regulatory authorities, and the resultant waste materials are disposed of in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third-party property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of the products in our Lumivascular platform may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nWe require limited training in the use of our Lumivascular platform products because we market primarily to physicians who are experienced in the interventional techniques required to use our device. If demand for our Lumivascular platform continues to grow, less experienced physicians will likely use the devices, potentially leading to more injury and an increased risk of product liability claims. The use or misuse of our Lumivascular platform products has in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in complications, including damage to the treated artery, infection, internal bleeding, and limb loss, potentially leading to product liability claims. Our Lumivascular platform products are contraindicated for use in the carotid, cerebral, coronary, iliac, or renal arteries. Our sales force does not promote the use of our products for off-label indications, and our U.S. instructions for use specify that our Lumivascular platform products are not intended for use in the carotid, cerebral, coronary, iliac or renal arteries. However, we cannot prevent a physician from using our Lumivascular platform products for these off-label applications. The application of our Lumivascular platform products to coronary arteries, as opposed to peripheral arteries, is more likely to result in complications that have serious consequences. For example, if excised plaque were not captured properly in our device, it could be carried by the bloodstream to a more narrow location, blocking a coronary artery, leading to a heart attack, or blocking an artery to the brain, leading to a stroke. If our Lumivascular platform products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation initiated by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims are especially prevalent in the medical device industry and could harm our reputation, divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and may result in sizable damage awards against us. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the amount or breadth of our coverage may not be adequate for the claims that are made against us.\nThe expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for liabilities resulting from our products could harm us and our ability to sell our Lumivascular platform products.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage for future product liability claims. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, harm our reputation in the industry, significantly increase our expenses, and reduce product sales. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and operating results.\nSome of our customers and prospective customers may have difficulty in procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operations and use of our Lumivascular platform products. Medical malpractice carriers are also withdrawing coverage in certain states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens, our customers may discontinue using our Lumivascular platform products and potential customers may opt against purchasing our Lumivascular platform products due to the cost or inability to procure insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nOur stock price may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has fluctuated significantly since our IPO and is likely to continue to fluctuate substantially. As a result of this price fluctuation, investors may experience losses on their investments in our stock. In addition, the development stage of our operations may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nsales of stock by our existing stockholders, including our affiliates;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our Lumivascular platform and products;\n\u25cf\nthe results of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nchanges in analysts\u2019 estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 and our own estimates;\n\u25cf\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in the medical device industry in particular;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of key personnel, including changes in our board of directors and management;\n\u25cf\nlegislation or regulation of our business;\n\u25cf\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement or approvals of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and to litigation; and\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our industry.\nFrom time to time, our affiliates may sell stock for reasons due to their personal financial circumstances. These sales may be interpreted by other stockholders as an indication of our performance and result in subsequent sales of our stock that have the effect of creating downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock has been volatile over the past year and it may continue to be volatile. Over the past year, our common stock has traded as low as $0.23 and as high as $1.25 per share. We cannot predict the price at which our common stock will trade in the future and it may decline. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and may be influenced by many factors, including our financial results; developments generally affecting our industry; general economic, industry and market conditions; the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock; investor perceptions of our business; reports by industry analysts; announcements by other market participants, including, among others, investors, our competitors, and our customers; regulatory action affecting our business; and the impact of other \u201cRisk Factors\u201d discussed in this Annual Report. In addition, changes in the trading price of our common stock may be inconsistent with our operating results and outlook. The volatility of the market price of our common stock may adversely affect investors\u2019 ability to purchase or sell shares of our common stock.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have provided in the past and may provide guidance in the future about our business and future operating results. In developing this guidance, our management must make certain assumptions and judgments about our future performance, including projected revenues and the timing of regulatory approvals. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock would decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. The analysts who previously published research reports on our stock following our IPO have discontinued coverage. Although one new analyst initiated coverage of our business in September 2019, if additional analysts do not begin regularly publishing reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including by our existing stockholders, could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that these sales and others may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe will need to raise additional funds through future equity or debt financings to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for product development, clinical trials and commercialization. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in raising funds pursuant to additional equity or debt financings or that such funds will be raised at prices that do not create substantial dilution for our existing stockholders. Given our stock price, any financing that we undertake in the future could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOn March 7, 2019, we filed a universal shelf registration statement (the \u201cShelf Registration Statement\u201d) to offer up to $50.0 million of our securities. We have established, and may in the future establish, \u201cat-the-market\u201d programs pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. Due to the SEC\u2019s \u201cbaby shelf rules,\u201d which prohibit companies with a public float of less than $75 million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company\u2019s public float in a twelve-month period. In the past, we were limited to using the Shelf Registration Statement. We are no longer limited from issuing securities under the Shelf Registration Statement.\nOur directors and employees may sell our stock through 10b5-1 trading plans or in the market during open windows under our insider trading policy without such plans in place. Sales of our common stock by our directors and employees could be perceived negatively by investors or cause downward pressure on our common stock and cause a reduction in the price of our common stock as a result. We have also registered shares of our common stock that we may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. These shares will be able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. Our management and other personnel now need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns and our costs and expenses will increase, which could harm our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nWe will incur additional compensation costs in the event that we decide to pay our executive officers cash compensation closer to that of executive officers of other public medical device companies, which would increase our general and administrative expense and could harm our profitability. Any future equity awards will also increase our compensation expense. We also expect that being a public company and compliance with applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which could be advantageous to our competitors and clients and could result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from its exchange, which could harm our business and limit our stockholders\u2019 liquidity.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. However, we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future. In order to continue listing our common stock on Nasdaq, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders\u2019 equity, a minimum number of holders of our common stock and a minimum bid price.\nOn March 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Qualifications Department notifying us that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price for the Company\u2019s listed securities was less than $1 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. The Company initially had a period of 180 calendar days, or until September 8, 2020, to regain compliance with the rule referred to in this paragraph. On April 20, 2020, we received a subsequent written notice from Nasdaq indicating that Nasdaq filed an immediately effective rule change with SEC on April 16, 2020, pursuant which the compliance periods for bid price and market value of publicly held shares requirements were tolled through June 30, 2020, meaning that the Company had until November 20, 2020 to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement. The Company did not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by November 20, 2020. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company provided written notice to Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency and, on November 24, 2020, the Company received notice that Nasdaq granted the Company an additional 180 calendar days, or until May 19, 2021, to regain compliance.\nOn January 26, 2021, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Staff had determined that the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock had been at $1.00 per share or greater for at least 10 consecutive business days and, accordingly, that the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market and that the matter is now closed. While the Company has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in the future.\nIf Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d If our common stock continues to be listed on NASDAQ, our common stock will be a covered security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage a takeover.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\na classified board of directors;\n\u25cf\nadvance notice requirements applicable to stockholders for matters to be brought before a meeting of stockholders and requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u25cf\na supermajority stockholder vote requirement for amending certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u25cf\nthe right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf\nallowing stockholders to remove directors only for cause;\n\u25cf\na requirement that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u25cf\nallowing all vacancies, including newly created directorships, to be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, except as otherwise required by law;\n\u25cf\na requirement that our stockholders may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u25cf\nlimiting the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware; and\n\u25cf\nlimiting the persons that can call special meetings of our stockholders to our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer).\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers or employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our Loan Agreement with CRG prohibits us from, among other things, paying any dividends or making any other distribution or payment on account of our common stock. The terms of our Series A preferred stock and our Series B preferred stock provide that we may not pay dividends on our common stock without concurrently declaring dividends on each. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if you sell our common stock after our stock price appreciates. For more information on restrictions governing our ability to pay dividends, see the section titled \u201cDividend Policy\u201d below.\nCRG has the ability to exert significant control over matters pursuant to the protective provisions therein as well as the covenants and other restrictions in the Loan Agreement.\nEven though Series A preferred stock is non-voting stock, our governing documents, as amended, have protective provisions that will require CRG to consent to certain significant Company events. For example, CRG\u2019s consent would be necessary to create additional shares of Series A preferred stock, amend our organizational documents, or approve any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This consent requirement could delay or prevent any acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Series A preferred stock has a liquidation preference senior to our common stock and Series B preferred stock.\nSeries A preferred stock has a liquidation preference that gets paid prior to any payment on our common stock (including shares issuable upon the exercise of our outstanding warrants) and Series B preferred stock. As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate, merge with another company or sell our assets, the holders of our Series A preferred stock would have the right to receive up to approximately $52.2 million as of December 31, 2020, plus any unpaid dividends from any such transaction before any amount is paid to the holders of our Series B preferred stock or common stock or pursuant to the redemption rights in the warrants for fundamental transactions. The payment of the liquidation preferences could result in common stockholders, Series B preferred stockholders and warrant holders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily. In January 2019, December 2019 and December 2020, 2,945, 3,580 and 3,866 additional shares of Series A preferred stock, respectively, were issued to CRG as payment of dividends accrued through December 31, 2020.\nThe existence of the liquidation preferences may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares of common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control.\nWe have limited shares available for issuance to raise capital to fund our operations and grant stock-based incentive awards to employees, directors, and consultants. If we are unable to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance, our business will be adversely affected.\nCurrently, we have 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock. As of February 26, 2021, we had 95,298,129 shares of common stock outstanding. After taking into account the 3,173,462 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, and vesting of restricted stock units, we have a very limited number of shares available for issuance. For all practical purposes, the authorized shares of our common stock have been fully utilized, restricting our ability to issue any more shares. At our annual meeting in December 2020, we solicited our shareholders to approve a reverse stock split, which would decrease the number of outstanding shares and allow additional shares to be issued in future offerings; however, we did not receive the requisite shareholder approval. We plan to present proposals at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to (a) effect a reverse stock split or (b) increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. However, if such proposals are not approved, we will have virtually no shares available for issuance to raise capital to fund our operations, make grants of stock-based incentive awards, or take such other actions requiring available capital stock needed to operate our business. Further delays in securing, or the failure to secure, shareholder approval for a reverse stock split or approval to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common may prevent us from executing a capital raising transaction, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15172, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "AVGR"}
