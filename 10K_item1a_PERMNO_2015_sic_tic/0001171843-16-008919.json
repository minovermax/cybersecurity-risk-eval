{"cik": "1105533", "company": "ARGOS THERAPEUTICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves multiple risks and substantial uncertainty. The following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, actual results to differ from expectations in material ways. In evaluating our business, investors should pay particular attention to the risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nWe depend heavily on the success of our two product candidates, AGS-003 and AGS-004, both of which are still in clinical development. Clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable to commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale. We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of AGS-003 for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or mRCC, and other cancers and AGS-004 for the treatment of HIV. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for at least the next several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of these product candidates. The success of these product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022 successful completion of clinical trials, including clinical results that are statistically significant as well as clinically meaningful in the context of the indications for which we are developing our product candidates;\n\u2022 receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities by building out and equipping a commercial manufacturing facility for our Arcelis-based product candidates or, alternatively, entering into a commercial supply arrangement with a contract manufacturer;\n\u2022 maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022 launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022 commercial acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third party payors;\n\u2022 obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022 effectively competing with other therapies; and\n\u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following any marketing approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates, such as our ADAPT trial of AGS-003, fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. For instance, despite observing positive results in earlier clinical trials of AGS-004, we failed to achieve the primary endpoint of our Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004. Similarly, recommendations of the independent data monitoring committee that the ADAPT trial should be continued based on results of the committee\u2019s interim data analyses of interim trial results may not be indicative as to results of the trial. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nIn particular, to date, we have not completed a clinical trial of AGS-003 against a placebo or a comparator therapy. While we believe comparisons to results from other reported clinical trials or from analyses of data from the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium, or the Consortium, can assist in evaluating the potential efficacy of our AGS-003 product candidate, there are many factors that affect the outcome for patients, some of which are not apparent in published reports. As a result, results from two different trials or between a trial and an analysis of a treatment database often cannot be reliably compared. Our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 is intended to compare directly the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib or another targeted therapy to treatment with sunitinib or another targeted therapy monotherapy. Based on the design of the trial, the data from the trial will need to demonstrate an increase of approximately six months in median overall survival for the AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy arm as compared to the sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy control arm in order to show statistical significance and achieve the primary endpoint of the trial. We will need to show this statistically significant benefit of the combined therapy as compared to treatment with the sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy as part of a submission for approval of AGS-003. However, demonstration of statistical significance and achievement of the primary endpoint of the trial do not assure approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.\nPatients in our ADAPT trial who receive treatment with sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy may not have results similar to patients studied in clinical trials of sunitinib or to patients in the Consortium database who were treated with sunitinib. If the patients in our ADAPT trial who receive sunitinib / targeted therapy plus placebo have results which are better than the results that occurred in those other clinical trials or the results described in the Consortium database, we may not demonstrate a sufficient benefit from AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib to allow the FDA to approve AGS-003 for marketing. In addition, only 21 patients received the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib in our Phase 2 clinical trial. If the patients in our ADAPT trial who receive the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib / targeted therapy have results which are worse than the results that occurred in our Phase 2 clinical trial, we may not demonstrate a sufficient benefit from the combination therapy to allow the FDA to approve AGS-003 for marketing.\nFor drug and biological products, the FDA typically requires the successful completion of two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to support marketing approval because a conclusion based on two such trials will be more reliable than a conclusion based on a single trial. In the case of AGS-003, which is intended for a life-threatening disease, we intend to seek approval based upon the results of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, our ADAPT trial. The FDA reviewed our plans to conduct our ADAPT trial under its special protocol assessment, or SPA, process. In February 2013, the FDA advised us in a letter that it had completed its review of our plans under the SPA process. The FDA also informed us that in order for a single trial to support approval of an indication, the trial must be well conducted, and the results of the trial must be internally consistent, clinically meaningful and statistically very persuasive. If the results for the primary endpoint are not robust, are subject to confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve our biologics license application, or BLA based upon a single clinical trial. In addition, because only 21 patients received the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib in our Phase 2 clinical trial, and as a result, we did not have enough evaluable patients to perform the statistical analysis to determine whether the primary endpoint of complete response rate was achieved in that trial, we expect that the data from our Phase 2 clinical trial will have only a limited impact on the FDA\u2019s ultimate assessment of efficacy of AGS-003. Thus, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will not require additional pivotal clinical trials as a condition for approving AGS-003.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022 not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022 be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022 be subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used; or\n\u2022 have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates. For example, in September 2011, the FDA placed the original protocol for our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib on partial clinical hold due to unresolved questions regarding the planned measurement of the secretion of the cytokine interleukin-12, or IL-12, as part of the specifications for the release of AGS-003. We subsequently reached an agreement with the FDA regarding the IL-12 release specifications and the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold.\nUnforeseen events that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates include:\n\u2022 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022 we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022 clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022 the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; for example, in our Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004, we experienced a higher dropout rate than we anticipated due to the higher than expected number of patients who did not complete the full 12 week antiretroviral treatment interruption required by the protocol for the trial;\n\u2022 our third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022 we may decide, or regulators or institutional review boards may require us or our investigators to, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u2022 the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nIn addition, the patients recruited for clinical trials of our product candidates may have a disease profile or other characteristics that are different than we expect and different than the clinical trials were designed for, which could adversely impact the results of the clinical trials. For instance, our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial of AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib was originally designed to enroll patients with favorable disease risk profiles and intermediate disease risk profiles and with a primary endpoint of complete response rate. However, the actual trial population consisted entirely of patients with intermediate disease risk profiles and poor disease risk profiles. This is a population for which published research has shown that sunitinib alone, as well as other of the targeted therapies for mRCC, rarely if ever produce complete responses in mRCC, and in our Phase 2 clinical trial in this population the combination therapy of AGS-003 and sunitinib did not show a complete response rate that met the endpoint of the trial.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. For example, in response to our submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AGS-004, the FDA raised safety concerns regarding the analytical treatment interruption contemplated by our protocol for our Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004, and required a one year safety follow-up after the final dose for each patient. This resulted in the need for an amendment to the trial protocol and a four month delay prior to initiating the Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States. In addition to additional costs, significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe FDA has reviewed the protocol for our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib / targeted therapy under the SPA process. However, agreement by the FDA with the protocol under the SPA process does not guarantee that the trial will be successful or that, if successful, AGS-003 will receive marketing approval.\nThe FDA has reviewed, under the SPA process, the protocol for our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib / targeted therapy. The SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA\u2019s review and approval of drug and biological products by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug candidate\u2019s efficacy. In February 2012, we received a letter from the FDA advising us that the FDA had completed its review of our protocol for the ADAPT trial under the SPA process. In the letter, the FDA stated that it had determined that the protocol sufficiently addressed the trial\u2019s objectives and that the trial was adequately designed to provide the necessary data to support a submission for marketing approval.\nAn SPA does not guarantee that AGS-003 will receive marketing approval. The FDA may raise issues related to safety, trial conduct, bias, deviation from the protocol, statistical power, patient completion rates, changes in scientific or medical parameters or internal inconsistencies in the data prior to making its final decision. The FDA may also seek the guidance of an outside advisory committee prior to making its final decision. In addition, the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib may not achieve the primary endpoint of the trial. Even if the primary endpoint in our ADAPT trial is achieved, AGS-003 may not be approved. Many companies which have been granted SPAs have ultimately failed to obtain final approval to market their products.\nIn its February 2012 letter, the FDA informed us that in order for a single trial to support approval of an indication, the trial must be well conducted, and the results of the trial must be internally consistent, clinically meaningful and statistically very persuasive. If the results for the primary endpoint are not robust, are subject to confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve our BLA based upon a single clinical trial. There can be no guarantee that the FDA will not require additional pivotal clinical trials as a condition for approving AGS-003.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. For example, during the Phase 1/2 monotherapy clinical trial of AGS-003 that we conducted, our ability to enroll patients in the trial was adversely affected by the FDA\u2019s approval of sorafenib and sunitinib, because patients did not want to receive, and physicians were reluctant to administer, AGS-003 as a monotherapy once new therapies that showed efficacy in clinical trials were introduced to the market and became widely available.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022 severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022 eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u2022 perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022 patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022 the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022 proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nThe actual amount of time for full enrollment of our clinical trials could be longer than planned. Enrollment delays in any of our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our other clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nWe are developing AGS-004 for use with latency reversing drugs to eradicate HIV. If latency reversing drugs are not successfully developed for HIV on a timely basis or at all, we will be unable to develop AGS-004 for this use or will be delayed in doing so. In addition, because there are currently no products approved for HIV eradication, we cannot be certain of the clinical trials that we will need to conduct or the regulatory requirements that we will need to satisfy in order to obtain marketing approval of AGS-004 for this purpose.\nWe are focusing our development program for AGS-004 on the use of AGS-004 in combination with latency reversing drugs, including Vorinostat, to eradicate HIV. We plan to rely on these latency reversing drugs because we recognize that the ultimate objective of virus eradication is unlikely to be achieved with immunotherapy alone because the immune system is not able to recognize the HIV virus in latently infected cells with a low level or lack of expression of HIV antigens.\nSeveral companies and academic groups are evaluating latency reversing drugs that can potentially activate latently infected cells to increase viral antigen expression and make the cells vulnerable to elimination by the immune system. We are not a party to any arrangements with these companies or academic groups. If these companies or academic groups determine not to develop latency reversing drugs for this purpose because the drugs do not sufficiently increase viral antigen expression or have unacceptable toxicities, or these companies or academic groups otherwise determine to collaborate with other developers of immunotherapies on a combination therapy for complete virus eradication, we will not be able to complete our AGS-004 development program. In addition, if these companies or academic groups do not proceed with such development on a timely basis, our AGS-004 program correspondingly would be delayed.\nA number of the latency reversing drugs being evaluated for use in HIV patients are currently approved in the United States and elsewhere for use in the treatment of specified cancer indications. For instance Vorinostat is approved for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. If these drugs are not approved by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities for use in HIV, the FDA and these other regulatory authorities may not approve AGS-004 without the latency reversing drug having received marketing approval for HIV. If the FDA and these other regulatory authorities approve AGS-004 without the approval of the latency reversing drug for HIV, the use of AGS-004 in combination with the latency reversing drug for virus eradication would require sales of the latency reversing drug for off-label use. In such event, the success of the combination of AGS-004 and the latency reversing drug would be subject to the willingness of physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community to use the latency reversing drug for off-label use and of government authorities and third party payors to pay for the combination therapy. In addition, we would be limited in our ability to market the combination for its intended use if the latency reversing drug were to be used off-label.\nCurrently, there are no products approved for the eradication of HIV. As a result, we cannot be certain as to the clinical trials we will need to conduct or the regulatory requirements that we will need to satisfy in order to obtain marketing approval of AGS-004 for the eradication of HIV.\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates.\nAll of our product candidates are still in preclinical or clinical development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In addition, such effects or characteristics could cause an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates, require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other tests or studies, and could result in a more restrictive label, or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nOur Arcelis-based product candidates are immunotherapies that are based on a novel technology utilizing a patient\u2019s own tissue. This may raise development issues that we may not be able to resolve, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval or personnel issues that may prevent us from further developing and commercializing our product candidates.\nAGS-003 and AGS-004 are based on our novel Arcelis technology platform. In the course of developing this platform and these product candidates, we have encountered difficulties in the development process. For example, we terminated the development of MB-002, the predecessor to AGS-003, when the results from the initial clinical trial of MB-002 indicated that the product candidate only corrected defects in the production of one of two critical cytokines required for effective immune response. There can be no assurance that additional development problems will not arise in the future which we may not be able to resolve or which may cause significant delays in development.\nIn addition, regulatory approval of novel product candidates such as our Arcelis-based product candidates manufactured using novel manufacturing processes such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to our and regulatory agencies\u2019 lack of experience with them. The FDA has only approved one individualized immunotherapy product to date. This lack of experience may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions.\nThe novel nature of our product candidates also means that fewer people are trained in or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it difficult to find, hire and retain capable personnel for research, development and manufacturing positions.\nDevelopment of our Arcelis-based product candidates is subject to significant uncertainty because each product candidate is derived from source material that is inherently variable. This variability could reduce the effectiveness of our Arcelis-based product candidates, delay any FDA approval of our Arcelis-based product candidates, cause us to change our manufacturing methods and adversely affect the commercial success of any approved Arcelis-based products.\nThe disease samples from the patients to be treated with our Arcelis-based products vary from patient to patient. This inherent variability may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products because each tumor or virus sample that we receive and process will yield a different product. As a result, we may not be able to consistently produce a product for every patient and we may not be able to treat all patients effectively. Such inconsistency could delay FDA or other regulatory approval of our Arcelis-based product candidates or if approved, adversely affect market acceptance and use of our Arcelis-based products. If we have to change our manufacturing methods to address any inconsistency, we may have to perform additional clinical trials, which would delay FDA or other regulatory approval of our Arcelis-based product candidates and increase the costs of development of our Arcelis-based product candidates.\nThe inherent variability of the disease samples from the patients to be treated with our Arcelis-based products may further adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products because variability in the source material for our product candidates, such as tumor cells or viruses, may cause variability in the composition of other cells in our product candidates. Such variability in composition or purity could adversely affect our ability to establish acceptable release specifications and the development and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates may be delayed, which would increase the costs of development of our Arcelis-based product candidates.\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for either of our product candidates will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on third party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. To date, the FDA has only approved one individualized immunotherapy product. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nWe are a party to arrangements with third parties, and intend to enter into additional arrangements with third parties, under which they would market our products outside the United States. In order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we or such third parties must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nA fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product demonstrates the potential to address unmet needs for this condition, the treatment sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. In April 2012, the FDA notified us that we obtained fast track designation for AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC. Fast track designation does not ensure that we will experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for at least the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $279.0 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering of common stock, private placements of common stock, preferred stock and warrants, convertible debt financings, debt from financial institutions, government contracts, government and other third party grants and license and collaboration agreements. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. We have not completed development of any product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022 continue our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC;\n\u2022 continue to support ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004;\n\u2022 support planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004;\n\u2022 initiate and conduct additional trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 for the treatment of cancers and HIV;\n\u2022 seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022 purchase or lease, and build out and equip, a commercial facility for the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products;\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 continue our other research and development efforts;\n\u2022 hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific and management personnel; and\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned commercialization efforts.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize a product or products with significant market potential. This development and commercialization will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including successfully completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, building out and equipping a commercial manufacturing facility and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of some of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate our product development programs, including our ADAPT trial of AGS-003, our plans to purchase, build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility or our commercialization efforts and to take other actions to reduce out operating expenses.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC, continue to support ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004, support planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004, initiate and conduct additional clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 for the treatment of cancers and HIV, seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and purchase or lease, and build out and equip, a commercial manufacturing facility. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate our product development programs, our plans to purchase or lease, and build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility or our commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.2 million and working capital of $0.7 million. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that the $19.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants at the initial closing of our March 2016 private placement, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2015 and the anticipated funding under our contract with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the third quarter of 2016.\nOur March 2016 private placement includes three tranches. The initial tranche closed in March 2016, and the second and third tranches are conditioned on the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and other closing conditions. For a description of the terms of the private placement, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Liquidity-PIPE Financing\u201d. If the milestones and closing conditions are achieved and the second and third tranches are consummated, we expect that the estimated $59.0 million of net proceeds from all three tranches of our private placement, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2015 and the anticipated funding under our contract with the NIH and NIAID, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the second quarter of 2017, when we expect final data from the ADAPT trial. We expect that these funds will be sufficient to enable us to support the ongoing and planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003, certain of the manufacturing costs of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 for HIV eradication in patients with early stage RCC and certain costs related to commercial manufacturing. We expect that these funds will not, however, be sufficient to enable us to complete required activities in preparation for the submission of a BLA to the FDA for AGS-003, to perform pre-commercialization activities for AGS-003 or to commercially launch AGS-003. These expectations are based on our current operating plan under which we plan to implement measures to reduce our operating expenses, including reductions in spending for activities in preparation for submission of a BLA. These reductions may include reductions in planned spending related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls, process validation, quality, supply management and commercial preparation. Under our plan, we also intend to seek to refinance our existing venture loan facility with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation, or Horizon, and Fortress Credit Co LLC, or Fortress, and to enter into collaborations for the development, marketing and distribution of AGS-003 outside North America and of our non-oncology product candidates, including AGS-004. If we are unable to refinance our venture loan facility or enter into any such collaborations, we may be required to implement additional measures to materially reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business and operations. It is also possible that our available funds will not enable us to obtain final data from the ADAPT trial because the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays. We have no external sources of funds other than our contract with the NIH and NIAID for the development of AGS-004.\nWe also will need to obtain significant financing if we decide to purchase, build out and equip a new commercial manufacturing facility. Our preliminary estimate indicates that we will require approximately an additional $30.0 million prior to the commercialization of AGS-003 to purchase, build out and equip the commercial manufacturing facility. These costs do not include the costs to implement the automated manufacturing process. We are actively exploring financing arrangements in connection with the planned purchase, build out and equipping of the commercial manufacturing facility and are in discussions with developers, lenders and other potential financing sources regarding potential financial support. Unless we select an alternative plan for the commercial supply of our products, we expect to enter into such arrangements during the second quarter of 2016 and that such arrangements will likely involve material obligations and debt liabilities. We are also exploring alternatives for the commercial supply of our products, including building out and equipping our current facility for commercial manufacture, leasing and equipping an existing manufacturing space that would be built out for commercial manufacture, and engaging a contract manufacturer to supply AGS-003 on a commercial scale on our behalf. We will also need to obtain additional financing with any of these alternatives. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed, in the required amounts or at all, we may not be able to complete the planned purchase, build-out and equipping of the new commercial facility or be able to lease and equip an existing commercial facility, or may be delayed in doing so.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the progress and results of our ADAPT trial and the ongoing and planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 that we support or plan to support;\n\u2022 the progress and results of the ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 for HIV eradication that we support and the planned investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 that we plan to support and our ability to obtain additional funding under our NIH and NIAID contract for our AGS-004 program;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates;\n\u2022 the purchase price for, and the costs and timing of our planned purchase, build-out and equipping of a new commercial manufacturing facility, the costs and timing of building out and equipping a new commercial manufacturing facility at our current facility or at a new leased facility, or, the costs and timing of entering into a commercial supply arrangement with a contract manufacturer, and any costs and liabilities associated with any financing arrangements entered into to fund the costs of these activities;\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022 the potential need to repay the $8.0 million remaining outstanding under the loan under our license agreement with Medinet Co. Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MEDcell Co., Ltd, which we refer to together as Medinet;\n\u2022 revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates be approved by the FDA or a similar regulatory authority outside the United States;\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain government or other third party funding for the development of our product candidates; and\n\u2022 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, particularly arrangements to develop, market and distribute AGS-003 outside North America and arrangements for the development and commercialization of our non-oncology product candidates, including AGS-004.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our losses from operations and required additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government contracts, government and other third party grants or other third party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We will require substantial funding to complete the planned purchase, build-out and equipping of a new commercial manufacturing facility or to build out and equip a leased commercial manufacturing facility, complete required activities in preparation for the submission of a BLA for AGS-003, fund our commercialization efforts and fund our other operating expenses and other activities. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. For example, in March 2016, we issued and sold in a private placement an aggregate of 3,652,430 shares of our common stock, plus warrants to purchase a total of 2,739,323 additional shares of common stock, which resulted in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we complete the second and third tranches of this private placement, this will result in further dilution to the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nDebt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nWe currently intend to collaborate with third parties for the manufacturing, development or commercialization of AGS-003 outside of North America. We plan to seek government or other third party funding for the continued development of AGS-004 and to collaborate with third parties for the development and commercialization of AGS-004. If we raise additional funds through government or other third party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If the loan from Medinet becomes due and we do not repay it, we have agreed to grant Medinet a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan for the treatment of cancer.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and tax credit carryforwards may be limited.\nThe utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation under the rules regarding a change in stock ownership as determined by the Internal Revenue Code, and state and foreign tax laws. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, other tax carryforwards, and certain built-in losses upon an ownership change as defined under that section. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions that increase the aggregate ownership of certain of our stockholders by more than 50 percentage points over a three year testing period. If we have undergone a Section 382 ownership change, an annual limitation would be imposed on certain of our tax attributes, including NOL and capital loss carryforwards, and certain other losses, credits, deductions or tax basis. As of December 31, 2015, we have not completed a formal study to determine whether there are 382 limitations that apply However, we believe that, by engaging in the financing transactions in which we have engaged, we may have triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax credit carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisk Related to the Commercialization of our Product Candidates\nWe have no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability.\nOur operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, developing our technology and product candidates and establishing collaborations. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete a pivotal clinical trial, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition at some point from a company with research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nEven if AGS-003 or AGS-004 receives regulatory approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate. Even if AGS-003 or AGS-004 receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. Gaining market acceptance for our Arcelis-based products may be particularly difficult as, to date, the FDA has only approved one individualized immunotherapy and our Arcelis-based products are based on a novel technology. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022 convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022 the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022 the approval of other new products for the same indications;\n\u2022 the ability of our product to be combined with emerging standards of care;\n\u2022 availability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third party payors;\n\u2022 adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022 clinical indications for which the product is approved; and\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we, or others, later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability to market the product could be compromised.\nClinical trials of our product candidates are conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, in a broader patient population or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, we, or others, discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\u2022 we may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered;\n\u2022 additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022 we may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022 additional restrictions may be imposed on the distribution or use of the product via a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022 the product may become less competitive; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We plan to market and sell AGS-003 in North America independently and to enter into collaborations or other arrangements with third parties for the distribution or marketing of AGS-003 in the rest of the world. We plan to enter into collaborations or other arrangements with third parties for the distribution or marketing of AGS-004 and any of our other product candidates should such candidates receive marketing approval.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022 our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022 the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022 the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our product candidates. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nSome of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Many marketed therapies for the indications that we are currently pursuing, or indications that we may in the future seek to address using our Arcelis platform, are widely accepted by physicians, patients and payors, which may make it difficult for us to replace them with any products that we successfully develop and are permitted to market.\nThe FDA has approved several targeted therapies as monotherapies for mRCC, including Nexavar (sorafenib), marketed by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Sutent (sunitinib) and Inlyta (axitinib), marketed by Pfizer, Inc.; Avastin (bevacizumab), marketed by Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group; Votrient (pazopanib) and Afinitor (everolimus), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Torisel (temsirolimus), marketed by Pfizer and most recently, Opdivo (nivolumab) for second-line RCC, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In addition, we estimate that there are numerous therapies for mRCC in clinical development by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types and stages. A number of these are in late stage development. Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in combination for first-line mRCC is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is currently being compared in a Phase 3 trial to sunitinib. Cometriq (cabozantinib) is being developed by Exelixis has recently reported positive results from its Phase 3 trial and is expected to receive FDA approval for second-line mRCC in 2016. In addition, if a standalone therapy for mRCC were developed that demonstrated improved efficacy over currently marketed first-line therapies with a favorable safety profile and without the need for combination therapy, such a therapy might pose a significant competitive threat to AGS-003.\nWe are currently conducting our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy. We elected to study AGS-003 in clinical trials in combination with sunitinib due in part to sunitinib being the current standard of care for first-line treatment of mRCC. Although we do not expect to seek FDA approval of AGS-003 solely in combination with sunitinib and have provided that, under the protocol for the ADAPT trial, investigators may discontinue sunitinib due to disease progression or toxicity and initiate second-line treatment with other approved compatible therapies, if we obtain approval by the FDA, such FDA approval may be limited to the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib. In such event, the commercial success of AGS-003 would be linked to the commercial success of sunitinib. As a result, if sunitinib ceases to be the standard of care for first-line treatment of mRCC or another event occurs that adversely affects sales of sunitinib, the commercial success of AGS-003 may be adversely affected.\nThere are also numerous FDA-approved treatments for HIV, primarily antiretroviral therapies marketed by large pharmaceutical companies. Generic competition has developed in this market as patent exclusivity periods for older drugs have expired, with more than 15 generic drugs currently on the market. The presence of these generic drugs is resulting in price pressure in the HIV therapeutics market and could affect the pricing of AGS-004. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the eradication of HIV. We expect that major pharmaceutical companies that currently market antiretroviral therapy products or other companies that are developing HIV product candidates may seek to develop products for the eradication of HIV.\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and device industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States, recently passed legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. These risks may be even greater with respect to our Arcelis-based products which are manufactured using a novel technology. None of our product candidates has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore our safety data are limited. We derive the raw materials for manufacturing of our Arcelis-based product candidates from human cell sources, and therefore the manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive and stringent, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022 loss of revenue; and\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million in product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin commercializing our product candidates, if ever. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have based our research and development efforts on our Arcelis platform. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in our Arcelis platform, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed drugs using this approach. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our Arcelis platform, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nOur long-term business plan is to develop Arcelis-based products for the treatment of various cancers and infectious diseases. We may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates that may be manufactured using our Arcelis platform. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur reliance on government funding adds uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts and may impose requirements that increase the costs of commercialization and production of our government-funded product candidates.\nOur current development of AGS-004 is primarily funded by the NIH. We are dependent upon further government funding for continued development of AGS-004. However, increased pressure on governmental budgets may reduce the availability of government funding for programs such as AGS-004. In addition, contracts and grants from the U.S. government and its agencies include provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to:\n\u2022 terminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022 reduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022 claim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u2022 impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u2022 suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government or a specific government agency;\n\u2022 pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u2022 limit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nGovernment agreements normally contain additional terms and conditions that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These include, for example:\n\u2022 specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n\u2022 mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022 public disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u2022 mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nWe expect to depend on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe currently intend to commercialize AGS-003 independently in North America. We intend to collaborate with other third parties to manufacture, develop or commercialize AGS-003 outside North America. We have entered into an exclusive license agreement with Pharmstandard International S.A., or Pharmstandard, for the development and commercialization of AGS-003 in Russia and the other states comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States and an exclusive license agreement with Green Cross Corp., or Green Cross, for the development and commercialization of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC in South Korea and an exclusive license agreement with Lummy (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., or Lummy HK, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of AGS-003 in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. We have also entered into a license agreement with Medinet under which we granted Medinet an exclusive license to manufacture in Japan AGS-003 for the purpose of development and commercialization for the treatment of mRCC and an option to acquire a non-exclusive license to sell in Japan AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC. We also plan to seek government or other third party funding for continued development of AGS-004 and to collaborate with third parties to develop and commercialize AGS-004. Our likely collaborators for any development, distribution, marketing, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies.\nUnder our existing arrangements we have limited control, and under any additional arrangements we may enter into with third parties we will likely have limited control, over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates would pose the following risks to us:\n\u2022 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022 collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022 collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or, require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022 a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022 collaborators may have the right to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates without our consent and could conduct trials with flawed designs that result in data that adversely affect our clinical trials, our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates or market acceptance of our product candidates. Pharmstandard, Green Cross, Medinet and Lummy HK each have this right under our license agreements with them;\n\u2022 collaborators may hold rights that could preclude us from commercializing our products in certain territories. For example, we have granted Medinet an exclusive license to manufacture in Japan AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC and an option to acquire a non-exclusive license to sell in Japan AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC. Even if, as expected, Medinet does not exercise the option to acquire the license to sell, we will not have the right to manufacture AGS-003 in Japan for the purposes of development and commercialization of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC. If we and Medinet are unable to agree to the terms of a supply agreement under these circumstances, we will not be able to sell AGS-003 in Japan unless we repurchase these rights from Medinet;\n\u2022 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022 disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022 collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates. For example, our collaboration with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. with respect to AGS-003 and AGS-004 was terminated by our collaborator.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we intend to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of those product candidates. For example, we have entered into license agreements with third parties to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize AGS-003 in Russia and the other states comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States, South Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, and we intend to collaborate with other third parties to develop and commercialize AGS-003 in other parts of the world and to collaborate with third parties to develop and commercialize AGS-004.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under existing license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to obtain such funding or enter into collaborations for our product candidate, we may have to curtail the development of such product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop these product candidates or bring these product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nFor instance, we recently received a notice from Health Canada that one of the sites at which we are conducting our Phase 3 ADAPT trial in Canada had been found to be non-compliant with Good Clinical Practice in Canada and that if the issues raised in the notice were not corrected, Health Canada could suspend our authorization to conduct the ADAPT trial at all sites in Canada. We have submitted a response to Health Canada, but if we are unable to satisfy Health Canada that the site is in compliance, the Phase 3 ADAPT trial could be suspended in Canada which would adversely affect our ability to complete the ADAPT trial on the anticipated timeline.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future distributors could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing of Our Product Candidates\nWe have commenced the build-out of a new facility to manufacture our Arcelis-based products on a commercial scale. We do not have experience in manufacturing Arcelis-based products on a commercial scale. If, due to our lack of manufacturing experience, we cannot manufacture our Arcelis-based products on a commercial scale successfully or manufacture sufficient product to meet our expected commercial requirements, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe currently manufacture our Arcelis-based product candidates for research and development purposes and for clinical trials of our product candidates at our facility in Durham, North Carolina. In August 2014, in connection with our plan to build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility, we entered into a lease agreement with the developer, TKC LXXII, LLC, or TKC. Under the lease agreement, we agreed to lease certain land and an approximately 124,000 square-foot building to be constructed in Durham County, North Carolina. This facility would house our corporate headquarters and commercial manufacturing. The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit basis in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans and was completed in June 2015. A portion of the build-out and equipping of the interior of the facility began in the second half of 2015.\nUnder the lease agreement, we had an option to purchase the property. In February 2015, we exercised this purchase option and entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with TKC. The purchase price to be paid by us is $7.6 million plus the amount of any additional costs incurred by TKC as a result of changes requested by us, for which we have paid $1.7 million as of December 31, 2015, and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced to us by TKC prior to the closing. Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we had until February 16, 2016 to consummate the purchase of the property. We are currently in discussions with TKC to extend the period for purchasing the property as we will need to obtain additional funding to consummate the purchase of the property. If we purchase the property, upon the closing, the lease agreement will terminate. If TKC is unwilling to extend the period, TKC will have no further obligation to sell the property to us.\nDue to our limited resources and the costs and challenges of building and equipping a new commercial facility, we are exploring alternative plans for the commercial supply of our products, including building out and equipping our current facility for commercial manufacture, leasing and equipping an existing manufacturing space that would have to be built out for commercial manufacture, and engaging a contract manufacturer to supply AGS-003 on a commercial scale on our behalf. We believe that building out and equipping our current facility would only be a temporary solution from a capacity standpoint and would only cover commercial manufacturing for a limited number of years.\nWe plan to initiate commercial manufacturing using our current manual manufacturing process and have decided to complete the development and implementation of our automated manufacturing process after commercial launch. Prior to implementing commercial manufacturing of AGS-003, we would be required to demonstrate that the commercial manufacturing facility is constructed and operated in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. We would also be required to show the comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using the manual processes in our current facility and AGS-003 produced using the manual process in the commercial manufacturing facility.\nIf we transition to automated manufacturing processes, we expect our automated manufacturing processes will be based on existing functioning prototypes of automated devices for the production of commercial quantities of our Arcelis-based product candidates. These devices can be used to perform substantially all steps required for the manufacture of our Arcelis-based product candidates.\nWe do not have experience in manufacturing products on a commercial scale or using automated processes. In addition, because we are aware of only one company that has manufactured an individualized immunotherapy product for commercial sale, there are limited precedents from which we can learn. We may encounter difficulties in the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products due to our limited manufacturing experience. These difficulties could delay the build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility and regulatory approval of the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products using the facility, increase our costs or cause production delays or result in us not manufacturing sufficient product to meet our expected commercial requirements, any of which could damage our reputation and hurt our profitability. If we are unable to successfully increase our manufacturing capacity to commercial scale, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe need to establish commercial manufacturing operations and augment our manufacturing personnel in advance of any regulatory submission for approval of AGS-003. If we fail to establish commercial manufacturing operations in compliance with regulatory requirements, or augment our manufacturing personnel, we may not be able to initiate commercial operations or produce sufficient product to meet our expected commercial requirements. We have delayed the implementation of our automated manufacturing process and may not be able to use such process on a timely basis or at all.\nIn order to meet our business plan, which contemplates manufacturing our product first using manual processes and later using automated processes for the commercial requirements of AGS-003 and any other Arcelis-based product candidates that might be approved, we plan to build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility and add manufacturing personnel in advance of any regulatory submission for approval of AGS-003. The planned purchase, build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility or, alternatively, the build out and equipping of a leased facility, will require substantial capital expenditures and additional regulatory approvals. In addition, it will be costly and time consuming to recruit necessary additional personnel.\nIf we are unable to successfully build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility in compliance with regulatory requirements or hire and train additional necessary manufacturing personnel appropriately, our filing for regulatory approval of AGS-003 may be delayed or denied.\nWe plan to delay the implementation of our automated manufacturing process until we obtain additional funding, and thus plan to seek approval of AGS-003 and, if approved, to initially commercially supply AGS-003 using manual manufacturing processes. Prior to implementing commercial manufacturing of AGS-003, we will be required to demonstrate that the commercial manufacturing facility is constructed and operated in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP. We will also be required to show the comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using the manual processes in our current facility and AGS-003 produced using the manual process in the new facility.\nOur implementation of automated processes could take longer, particularly if we are unable to achieve any of the required tasks on a timely basis, or at all. We are collaborating with Invetech Pty Ltd., or Invetech, and Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, or Saint-Gobain, to develop the equipment and disposables necessary to implement the automated manufacturing processes for Arcelis-based products. If Invetech or Saint-Gobain do not perform as expected under the agreements or the projects with Invetech or Saint-Gobain are unsuccessful for any other reason, our timelines for the implementation of our automated manufacturing processes could be further delayed and our business could be adversely affected.\nPrior to implementing the automated manufacturing processes for Arcelis-based products, we will be required to:\n\u2022\ndemonstrate that the disposable components and sterilization and packaging methods used in the manufacturing process are suitable for use in manufacturing in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, and current Good Tissue Practices, or cGTP;\n\u2022\nbuild and validate processing equipment that complies with cGMP and cGTP;\n\u2022\nequip a commercial manufacturing facility to accommodate the automated manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nperform process testing with final equipment, disposable components and reagents to demonstrate that the methods are suitable for use in cGMP and cGTP manufacturing;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate consistency and repeatability of the automated manufacturing processes in the production of AGS-003 in our new facility to fully validate the manufacturing and control process using the actual automated cGMP processing equipment; and\n\u2022 demonstrate comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using our manual processes and AGS-003 produced using the automated processes.\nWe will need regulatory approval to use the automated manufacturing processes for commercial purposes. If the FDA requires us to conduct a bridging study to demonstrate comparability between AGS-003 that we produce manually and AGS-003 produced using the automated processes, the implementation of the automated manufacturing processes and the filing for such approval will likely be delayed.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement the automated processes required and demonstrate comparability between the AGS-003 that we produce manually and the AGS-003 produced using the automated processes, our filing for regulatory approval of the commercial use of our automated manufacturing processes may be delayed or denied and we may not be able to initiate commercial\nmanufacturing using our automated manufacturing processes. In such event, our commercial manufacturing costs will be higher than anticipated and we may not be able to manufacture sufficient product to meet our expected commercial requirements.\nWe may in the future be dependent on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of AGS-003 or any of our other product candidates. If we experience problems with any such contract manufacturers, the manufacturing of AGS-003 or any of our other product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may choose to engage a contract manufacturer to supply AGS-003 on a commercial scale on our behalf. Reliance on such third-party contractors entails risks, including:\n\u2022 manufacturing delays if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between us and them;\n\u2022 the possible termination or nonrenewal of agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022 the possible breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;\n\u2022 the failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 the possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified;\n\u2022 the possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and\n\u2022 the possible misappropriation of our proprietary AGS-003 or any of our other product candidates.\nAny loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations, delay our clinical trials and, if our products are approved for sale, result in lost sales.\nLack of coordination internally among our employees and externally with physicians, hospitals and third- party suppliers and carriers, could cause manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays and cause us to not have sufficient product to meet our expected clinical trial requirements or potential commercial requirements.\nManufacturing our Arcelis-based product candidates requires coordination internally among our employees and externally with physicians, hospitals and third party suppliers and carriers. For example, a patient\u2019s physician or clinical site will need to coordinate with us for the shipping of a patient\u2019s disease sample and leukapheresis product to our manufacturing facility, and we will need to coordinate with them for the shipping of the manufactured product to them. Such coordination involves a number of risks that may lead to failures or delays in manufacturing our Arcelis-based product candidates, including:\n\u2022 failure to obtain a sufficient supply of key raw materials of suitable quality;\n\u2022 difficulties in manufacturing our product candidates for multiple patients simultaneously;\n\u2022 difficulties in obtaining adequate patient-specific material, such as tumor samples, virus samples or leukapheresis product, from physicians;\n\u2022 difficulties in completing the development and validation of the specialized assays required to ensure the consistency of our product candidates;\n\u2022 failure to ensure adequate quality control and assurances in the manufacturing process as we increase production quantities;\n\u2022 difficulties in the timely shipping of patient-specific materials to us or in the shipping of our product candidates to the treating physicians due to errors by third party carriers, transportation restrictions or other reasons;\n\u2022 destruction of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our product candidates during the shipping process due to improper handling by third party carriers, hospitals, physicians or us;\n\u2022 destruction of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our product candidates during storage at our facilities; and\n\u2022 destruction of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our product candidates stored at clinical and future commercial sites due to improper handling or holding by clinicians, hospitals or physicians.\nIf we are unable to coordinate appropriately, we may encounter delays or additional costs in achieving our clinical and commercialization objectives, including in obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates and supplying product, which could materially damage our business and financial position.\nIf our existing manufacturing facility or any commercial manufacturing facility that we are using is damaged or destroyed, or production at one of these facilities is otherwise interrupted, our business and prospects would be negatively affected.\nWe currently have a single manufacturing facility and expect that the new commercial manufacturing facility that we build out and equip will be our only commercial manufacturing facility in North America. If our existing manufacturing facility or the new commercial manufacturing facility that we plan to build out and equip, or the equipment in either of these facilities, is damaged or destroyed, we likely would not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity and possibly would not be able to replace it at all. Any new facility needed to replace either our existing manufacturing facility or a new commercial manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to be tailored to our specialized automated manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment. We would need FDA approval before selling any products manufactured at a new facility. Such an event could delay our clinical trials or, if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, reduce or eliminate our product sales.\nWe maintain insurance coverage to cover damage to our property and equipment and to cover business interruption and research and development restoration expenses. If we have underestimated our insurance needs with respect to an interruption in our clinical manufacturing of our product candidates, we may not be able to adequately cover our losses.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements with third parties, including with respect to each of AGS-003 and AGS-004, and we expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. For example, under our license agreement with Duke University which relates to patents and patent applications directed towards the composition of matter of Arcelis-based products, dendritic cells loaded with RNA from tumors or pathogens, methods of manufacture of these products and methods of using these products to treat tumors, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and market license products and to satisfy other specified obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these licenses, our licensors may have the right to terminate these license agreements, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, or to convert the license to a non-exclusive license, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under the license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We and our licensors have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development efforts before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties and are reliant on our licensors. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nThird parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, we own or exclusively license patents relating to our process of manufacturing an individualized drug product. A U.S. patent may be infringed by anyone who, without authorization, practices the patented process in the United States or imports a product made by a process covered by the U.S. patent. In foreign countries, however, importation of a product made by a process patented in that country may not constitute an infringing activity, which would limit our ability to enforce our process patents against importers in that country. Furthermore, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. If competitors are able to use our technologies, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\nFurthermore, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. Under the America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in September 2011, the United States moved to a first inventor to file system in March 2013. The United States Patent and Trademark Office only recently finalized the rules relating to these changes and courts have yet to address the new provisions. These changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights. Furthermore, we may become involved in interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, or other post-grant proceedings, such as reissue, reexamination or inter partes review proceedings, which may challenge our patent rights or the patent rights of others. For example, we have filed an application for reissue of one of our U.S. patents directed towards methods of manufacture of dendritic cells from monocytes stored for more than six hours and up to four days without freezing. An adverse determination in any such proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to or stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. For example, certain of the U.S. patents we exclusively license from Duke University expire as early as 2016 and the European and Japanese patents exclusively licensed from Duke University expire in 2017. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims against third parties, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, during an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that the patent rights we are asserting are invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, our licensors may have rights to file and prosecute such claims and we are reliant on them.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot ensure that third parties do not have, or will not in the future obtain, intellectual property rights such as granted patents that could block our ability to operate as we would like. There may be patents in the United States or abroad owned by third parties that, if valid, may block our ability to make, use or sell our products in the United States or certain countries outside the United States, or block our ability to import our products into the United States or into certain countries outside the United States.\nWe may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. For example, third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may be unable to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or even obtain a license at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe have research licenses to certain reagents and their use in the development of our product candidates. We would need commercial licenses to these reagents for any of our product candidates that receive approval for sale in the United States. We believe that commercial licenses to these reagents will be available. However, if we are unable to obtain any such commercial licenses, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates without infringing the patent rights of third parties. If we did seek to commercialize our product candidates without a license, these third parties could initiate legal proceedings against us.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. The types of protections available for trade secrets are particularly important with respect to our Arcelis platform\u2019s manufacturing capabilities, which involve significant unpatented know-how. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance Matters\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, cGTP requirements, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022 restrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u2022 restrictions on product distribution;\n\u2022 requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022 warning or untitled letters;\n\u2022 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022 recall of products;\n\u2022 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022 product seizure; or\n\u2022 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur relationships with customers and third party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, program exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u2022 the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022 the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022 the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law will require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; and\n\u2022 analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class in certain cases. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this and other more recent legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that is provided for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act or other more recent legislation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with health care practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the Health Care Reform Law, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or approved by the FDA until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product was approved under a BLA. The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning is subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that if any of our product candidates were to be approved as biological products under a BLA, such approved products should qualify for the four-year and 12-year periods of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten these exclusivity periods as proposed by President Obama, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Jeffrey Abbey, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Charles Nicolette, our Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, Lee F. Allen, our Chief Medical Officer, and Fred Miesowicz, our Vice President of Manufacturing and Chief Operating Officer, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors and affiliates of all officers and directors who own our outstanding common stock maintain the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and affiliates of all officers and directors who own our outstanding common stock beneficially own, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 61.6% of our outstanding common stock as of March 23, 2016. If we consummate the second and third tranches of the March 2016 private placement, and assuming that the shares in the third tranche are sold at a price of $5.35 per share, our executive officers, directors and affiliates of all officers and directors who own our outstanding common stock would beneficially own, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 79.1% of our outstanding common stock, based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of March 23, 2016. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nOur largest stockholder, Pharmstandard, could exert significant influence over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including any change of control.\nOur largest stockholder, Pharmstandard, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 34.2% of our outstanding common stock as of March 23, 2016. If we consummate the second and third tranches of the March 2016 private placement, and assuming that the shares in the third tranche are sold at a price of $5.35 per share, Pharmstandard would beneficially own, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 43.1% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, two members of our board of directors are affiliates of Pharmstandard. As a result, although Pharmstandard is subject to contractual limitations on its voting rights, we expect that Pharmstandard will be able to exert significant influence over our business. Pharmstandard may have interests that differ from your interests, and it may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022 establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022 allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022 limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022 require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022 require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares without depressing the market price for the shares or sell your shares at all. Any inactive trading market for our common stock may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund our operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nIf our stock price is volatile, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. For example, our stock has traded in a range from a low of $1.61 and high of $13.74 during the period of February 7, 2014 through March 23, 2016.The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022 our cash resources;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022 potential approvals of our product candidates for marketing by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities or our failure to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022 the results of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022 the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022 general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and plan to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not include all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In September 2014, we entered into a venture loan and security agreement with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation and Fortress Credit Co LLC. The terms of this agreement preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of March 23, 2016, we had 25,330,229 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, the 3,652,430 shares of our common stock issued in our March 2016 private placement are restricted and are subject to limitations on sale under federal securities laws for a period of up to six months or earlier if we file a registration statement covering such shares as we agreed under the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the private placement, and the additional 12,589,229 shares held by our directors, officers and affiliates are subject to applicable volume limitations on sales under federal securities laws. The balance of our outstanding shares of common stock may be freely sold in the public market at any time.\nIn addition, as of March 23, 2016, there were 3,908,549 shares subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans, all of which shares we have registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act, on a registration statement on Form S-8. These shares, once vested and issued upon exercise, will be able to be freely sold in the public market, subject to volume limits applicable to affiliates. Furthermore, following the initial closing of the private placement, there were 3,560,165 shares subject to outstanding warrants. The shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such warrants are exercised and to the extent covered by a registration statement or permitted by Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us, or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock to be less favorable, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14447, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARGSQ"}
