Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves risks. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, investors in the Company\u2019s securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in which case the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities could decline.\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities and Economic Conditions\nOur business is subject to various lending and other economic risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Our business is directly affected by general economic and market conditions; broad trends in industry and finance; legislative and regulatory changes; changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies; and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. A deterioration in economic conditions, in particular a prolonged economic slowdown within our geographic region or a broader disruption in the economy, including as a result of a pandemic or other widespread public health emergency, could result in the following consequences, any of which could hurt our business materially: an increase in loan delinquencies; an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; a decline in demand for our products and services; a deterioration in the value of collateral for loans made by our various business segments; and changes in the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company or its subsidiaries.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in our market areas or adverse conditions in an industry on which a local market in which we do business is dependent could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe provide full-service banking and other financial services throughout the Company\u2019s market areas, which include the Shenandoah Valley, Roanoke Valley, Richmond, and central regions of Virginia. Our loan and deposit activities are directly affected by, and our financial success depends on, economic conditions within these markets, as well as conditions in the industries on which those markets are economically dependent. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the condition of an industry on which a local market depends could adversely affect such factors as unemployment rates, business formations and expansions and housing market conditions. Adverse developments in any of these factors could result in among other things, a decline in loan demand, a reduction in the number of credit-worthy borrowers seeking loans, an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, an increase in classified and nonaccrual loans, a decrease in the value of loan collateral, and a decline in the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or business.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in its loan portfolio.\nLike all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans that its borrowers may not repay in their entirety. The Company believes that it maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date and in compliance with applicable accounting and regulatory guidance. However, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Accounting measurements related to impairment and the allowance for loan losses require significant estimates that are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. The significant uncertainties surrounding the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to execute their business models successfully through changing economic environments, competitive challenges, and other factors complicate the Company\u2019s estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, the actual losses may vary from current estimates. The Company expects fluctuations in the loan loss provisions due to the uncertain economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease the allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such required additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s concentration in loans secured by real estate may adversely affect earnings due to changes in the real estate markets.\nThe Company offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer, and other loans. Many of the Company\u2019s loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in the Company\u2019s market areas. A major change in the real estate markets, resulting in deterioration in the value of this collateral, or in the local or national economy, could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could negatively affect the Company. Risks of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry; the Company tries to limit its exposure to these risks by monitoring extensions of credit carefully. The Company cannot fully eliminate credit risk; thus, credit losses will occur in the future. Additionally, changes in the real estate market also affect the value of foreclosed assets, and therefore, additional losses may occur when management determines it is appropriate to sell the assets.\nThe Company has a significant exposure in commercial real estate, and loans with this type of collateral are viewed as having more risk of default.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio consists primarily of owner-operated properties and other commercial properties. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. Because the Company\u2019s loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s banking regulators generally give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio contains construction and development loans, and a decline in real estate values and economic conditions would adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the loans and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nAlthough most of the Company\u2019s construction and development loans are secured by real estate, the Company believes that, in the case of the majority of these loans, the real estate collateral by itself may not be a sufficient source for repayment of the loan if real estate values decline. If the Company is required to liquidate the collateral securing a construction and development loan to satisfy the debt, its earnings and capital may be adversely affected. A period of reduced real estate values may continue for some time, resulting in potential adverse effects on the Company\u2019s earnings and capital.\nThe Company\u2019s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company manages credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and a continuous quality assessment process of credit already extended. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company\u2019s credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide the Company with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nAlthough the Company emphasizes local lending practices, the Company purchases certain loans through a third-party lending program. These portfolios include commercial loans and carry risks associated with the borrower, changes in the economic environment, and the vendor themselves. The Company manages these risks through policies that require minimum credit scores and other underwriting requirements, robust analysis of actual performance versus expected performance, as well as ensuring compliance with the Company's vendor management program. While these policies are designed to manage the risks associated with these loans, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit losses.\nThe Company\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of the Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Any deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Company is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. The Company relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment that adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Company\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and its financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which the Company does not independently verify. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, the Company may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the customer. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nNonperforming assets adversely affect the Company in various ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects its income and increases loan administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile, which may reduce the amount of liquidity available to the Company and require a higher level of capital in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts, restructurings, and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including origination of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid increases in nonperforming assets in the future.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. Remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWeakness in the secondary residential mortgage loan markets or demand for mortgage loans may adversely affect income.\nOur mortgage department contributes to our noninterest income. We generate income from brokered mortgage loans and gains on sales of mortgage loans primarily from loans that we source and/or originate. Interest rates, housing inventory, housing demand, cash buyers, new mortgage lending regulations and other market conditions have a direct effect on loan originations across the industry. In particular, in a rising or higher interest rate environment, sourcing and originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold or brokered to investors. This would result in a decrease in noninterest income. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expenses (including for personnel and systems infrastructure) associated with mortgage banking activities. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nThe Company\u2019s wealth management revenue is directly impacted by the market value of assets under management, which could adversely impact Company profitability.\nA significant portion of revenue from wealth management services is based on the market value of assets under management, which may decrease due to a variety of factors including an economic slowdown. Any sustained period of lower market values of assets under management would adversely affect the Company\u2019s wealth management revenue and, as a result, would also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nWe are subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings divided by total interest-earning assets. Changes in interest rates will affect our net interest margin in diverse ways, including the pricing of loans and deposits, the levels of prepayments and asset quality. We are unable to predict actual fluctuations of market interest rates because many factors influencing interest rates, including changes in economic conditions, are beyond our control. We believe that our current interest rate exposure is manageable and does not indicate any significant exposure to interest rate changes. Although the Company does not believe it has significant exposure to changes in interest rates, it could experience pressure on the net interest margin due to intense competition for loans and deposits from both local and national financial institutions, as well as the effect of a continued period of low interest rates on interest income. In addition, the Company could experience net interest margin compression if it is unable to maintain its current level of loans outstanding by continuing to originate new loans or if it experiences a decrease in deposit balances, which would require the Company to seek funding from other sources at higher rates of interest.\nWe rely substantially on deposits obtained from customers in our target markets to provide liquidity and support growth.\nOur business strategies are based on access to funding from local customer deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including interest rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions that affect savings levels and the amount of liquidity in the economy, including government stimulus efforts in response to economic crises. If our deposit levels fall, we could lose a relatively low-cost source of funding and our interest expense would likely increase as we obtain alternative funding to replace lost deposits. If local customer deposits are not sufficient to fund our normal operations and growth, we will look to outside sources, such as borrowings from the FHLB, which is a secured funding source. Our ability to access borrowings from the FHLB will be dependent upon whether and the extent to which we can provide collateral to secure FHLB borrowings. We may also look to federal funds purchased and brokered deposits, although the use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by our banking regulators. We may also seek to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock, or other equity or equity-related securities, or debt securities including subordinated notes as additional sources of liquidity. If we are unable to access funding sufficient to support our business operations and growth strategies or are unable to access such funding on attractive terms, we may not be able to implement our business strategies which may negatively affect our financial performance.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds, general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards, or in other types of assets, including crypto currencies or other digital assets. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the loss of deposits as a lower cost source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition in our primary market area may limit asset growth and profitability.\nWe encounter strong competition from other financial institutions in our primary market area. In addition, established financial institutions not already operating in our primary market area may open branches at future dates. In the conduct of certain aspects of our business, we also compete with credit unions, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, real estate companies, Fintech, and other institutions, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation or restrictions as are imposed upon us. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer services that we do not provide. In addition, many of these competitors have numerous branch offices located throughout their extended market areas that may provide them with a competitive advantage. Finally, these institutions may have differing pricing and underwriting standards, which may adversely affect our company through the loss of business or causing a misalignment in our risk-return relationship. No assurance can be given that such competition will not have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations.\nThe carrying value of intangible assets, such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles, may be adversely affected.\nWhen a Company completes an acquisition, intangibles, such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles, are recorded on the date of acquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires an evaluation for impairment, and the Company would perform such impairment analysis at least annually. A significant adverse change in expected future cash flows, sustained adverse change in the Company\u2019s common stock, or a decline in core deposit balances could require the asset to become impaired. If impaired, the Company would incur a charge to earnings that could have a significant impact on the results of operations.\nThere are risks resulting from the use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output would be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nRisks Related to Operations and Technology\nThe Company\u2019s risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces. These risks include interest rate, credit, liquidity, operations, reputation, compliance, and litigation. While the Company assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company\u2019s risk-management program, or if its controls break down, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability or result in the loss of money, which could damage our reputation and our business.\nWe rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a possible security breach, our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. To date, the Company has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but the Company\u2019s systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Company could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers. If one or more such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our customers\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers\u2019 operations or result in the loss of money. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability, financial loss, and damage to our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We have implemented security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could result in damage to our reputation and our business.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While the Company has selected these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including poor performance of services, failure to provide services, disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor and failure to handle current or higher volumes, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business, and may harm its reputation. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties affect the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nOur business is technology dependent, and an inability to successfully implement technological improvements may adversely affect our ability to be competitive and our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, systems and services, which may require substantial initial investment to be implemented, including the cost of modifying or adapting existing products, systems and services. The Company invests in new technology to enhance customer service, and to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to create synergies in our operations through the use of technology and to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions in a manner that enhances the customer experience. We cannot give any assurance that technological improvements will increase operational efficiency or that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products, systems and services or be successful in marketing new products and services to our customers. A failure to maintain or enhance a competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate customer expectations, substantially fewer resources to invest in technological improvements than larger competitors, or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely manner, could result in higher operating costs, decreased customer satisfaction, and lower market share. An inability to effectively implement new technology and realize operational efficiencies could result in the loss of initial investments in such projects and higher operating costs. Either of these outcomes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of any of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and result in reduced revenues or increased expenses.\nWe are a relationship-driven organization. A key aspect of our business strategy is for our senior officers to have primary contact with our customers. Our growth and development to date have been, in large part, a result of these personalized relationships with our customer base.\nOur senior officers have considerable experience in the banking industry and related financial services and are extremely valuable and would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of these officers could have a material adverse effect upon future prospects. Although we believe the Company has excellent employee relations and provides competitive compensation to its senior officers, we cannot offer any assurance that they and other key employees will remain employed by us. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on operations and possibly result in reduced revenues or increased expenses.\nThe success of our business strategies depends on our ability to identify and recruit individuals with experience and relationships in our primary markets.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy will require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services. The market for qualified management personnel is competitive, which has contributed to salary and employee benefit costs that have risen and are expected to continue to rise, which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy is often lengthy, and we may not be able to effectively integrate these individuals into our operations. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage our operations effectively and in a timely manner could limit our growth, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nDifficulties in combining the operations of new or acquired bank branches, loan production offices or entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent the Company from achieving the expected benefits from acquisitions.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve fully the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies expected in opening a new branch or loan production office (LPO) or through an acquisition. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of a new or acquired entity or acquired branches or LPO's. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential new office locations or acquisition targets operate may be highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition; the Company may lose key personnel, either from the acquired entity or from itself; and the Company may not be able to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from a new office location or acquisition in a manner that improves its overall operating efficiencies. These factors could contribute to the Company\u2019s not achieving the expected benefits from its new branch or LPO locations or acquisitions within desired time frames, or at all. Future business acquisitions could be material to the Company, and it may issue additional shares of common stock to support those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests. Acquisitions could also require the Company to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt; the Company could therefore become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nThe inability of the Company to successfully manage its growth or implement its growth strategy may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy if it is unable to expand market share in existing locations, identify attractive markets, locations, or opportunities to expand in the future. In addition, the ability to manage growth successfully depends on whether the Company can maintain adequate capital levels, maintain cost controls, effectively manage asset quality, and successfully integrate any expanded business divisions or acquired businesses into the organization.\nAs the Company continues to implement its growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or banks, it expects to incur increased personnel, occupancy, and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, the Company must absorb those higher expenses while it begins to generate new deposits. In the case of acquired branches, the Company must absorb higher expenses while it begins deploying the newly assumed deposit liabilities. With either new branches opened, or branches acquired, there would be a time lag involved in deploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, the Company\u2019s plans to expand could depress earnings in the short run, even if it efficiently executes a branching strategy leading to long-term financial benefits.\nCombining Fincastle into the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than we expect.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of Fincastle into the business of the Company without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of Fincastle or the Company. If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine the businesses of the Company and Fincastle. To realize these anticipated benefits, the Company will integrate Fincastle\u2019s business into its own. The integration process in the Merger could result in the disruption of ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that affect adversely the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. If the Company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause the Company to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits from Fincastle or the Bank, or other unintended consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition after the Merger. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company for an indeterminate period after consummation of the Merger.\nThe Company may not be able to effectively integrate the operations of Fincastle into the Bank.\nThe future operating performance of the Company and the Bank will depend, in part, on the success of the merger of Fincastle with and into the Bank. The success of the subsidiary bank merger will, in turn, depend on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to (i) integrate the operations and branches of Fincastle and the Bank, (ii) retain the deposits and customers of Fincastle and the Bank, (iii) control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from the Merger in a manner that enables the combined bank to improve its overall operating efficiencies, and (iv) retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of Fincastle into the operations of the Bank, and reduce overlapping bank personnel. The integration of Fincastle and the Bank will require the dedication of the time and resources of the Bank\u2019s management and may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business of the Bank. If the Bank is unable to successfully integrate Fincastle, the Bank may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company\u2019s ongoing monitoring of internal controls, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal controls that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company continually works on improving its internal controls. However, the Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of the Company\u2019s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company or any of its subsidiaries is a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions.\nThe Company or any of its subsidiaries may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of its business, and the Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potential significant litigation risk. The Company\u2019s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it in legal or administrative actions or costs that it may incur defending such actions, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm the Company\u2019s reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements and/or costs incurred in any litigation exceed any applicable insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation for any period.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of the Company\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of the Company\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties over which the Company may have limited, or no control may experience disruptions that could adversely impact the Company.\nEvery year, retailers and service providers are the target of data systems incursions which result in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other financial data of their customers and users. These incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including the Company. Although our systems are not breached in such incursions, these events can cause the Company to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Company and its customers. In some cases, the Company may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company\u2019s control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (\u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nSevere weather, pandemics, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, pandemics, natural disasters, and other environmental risks, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, cause economic or market uncertainty, negatively impact consumer confidence, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread government response and the impact on consumers and businesses have caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets and may have had or may have a significant impact on consumers and businesses in our market area and the operations and financial performance of the Company. Governments, businesses and the public initially responded to the pandemic in ways that resulted in a significant disruption of economic activity, and the businesses of many of our customers have been adversely impacted, which could result in adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nAlthough the scope, duration and full effects of the pandemic are evolving and cannot be fully known at this time, consequences of the pandemic have included and may include further market volatility, lower interest rates, disrupted trade and supply chains, increased unemployment, rising prices, inflation and reduced economic activity. The period of recovery from the negative economic effects of the pandemic cannot be predicted and may be protracted. The effects of the pandemic on our borrowers has been mitigated by loan payment deferral programs and government stimulus or relief efforts, such as the PPP. However, as these programs have largely ended, signs of credit deterioration that were masked or obscured may emerge, and the Company can give no assurance that loan performance or net charge-offs will continue at the levels experienced in 2021 and 2020.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the acceptance and continued effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, the effects of the pandemic on our customers and vendors, the short- and long-term health impacts of the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. If the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, additional actions may be taken by federal, state, and local governments, or public behavior may change in response to evolving circumstances, to mitigate its effects. There can be no assurance that any efforts by the Company to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees. Furthermore, the financial condition of our customers and vendors may be adversely impacted, which may result in an elevated level of loan losses, a decrease in demand for our products and services, or reduced availability of services provided by third parties on which we rely. Any of these events may, in turn, have a material adverse impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of the Company\nCompliance with laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, both new and existing, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws, regulations and supervision from both federal and state agencies. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nLaws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, generally are intended to benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, but not stockholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenues, costs, earnings, and capital levels. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations.\nWe expect that financial institutions will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices. Future legislation, regulation and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe CFPB may increase our regulatory compliance burden and could affect the consumer financial products and services that we offer.\nAmong significant regulatory changes, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new financial consumer protection agency, the CFPB. The CFPB is reshaping the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive consumer finance products or practices, which are directly affecting the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services. This agency\u2019s broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction, financial product or service. Although the CFPB has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the CFPB may also apply to the Company or its subsidiaries by virtue of the adoption of such policies and best practices by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Further, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by the Company\u2019s primary regulators. The total costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory agency and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the Company with respect to its consumer product and service offerings have yet to be determined in their entirety. However, these costs, limitations and restrictions may produce significant, material effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve affect us significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold. Those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower's products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower\u2019s earnings and ability to repay a loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the Dodd-Frank Act, the short-term and long-term impact of which is uncertain.\nThe Company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each must maintain. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies have established stricter capital requirements and leverage limits for banking organizations, such as the Bank, that are based on the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. These stricter capital requirements were fully implemented on January 1, 2019. While the Economic Growth Act and recent federal banking regulations established a simplified leverage capital framework for smaller banks, these more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital and adversely affect future growth opportunities. In addition, if the Company fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely affect the Company or the businesses in which the Company is engaged.\nThe Company is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Laws and regulations change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, and the FDIC\u2019s DIF. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively affect the Company or its ability to increase the value of its business. Such changes could include higher capital requirements, and increased insurance premiums, increased compliance costs, reductions of noninterest income, and limitations on services that can be provided. Actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Company could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defend itself and may lead to liability or penalties that materially affect the Company and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement could be materially adverse to the Company and its shareholders.\nSee the section of this report entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for additional information on the statutory and regulatory issues that affect the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and capital.\nThe authorities that promulgate accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), the SEC, and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also impact the capital levels of the Company and the Bank or require the Company to incur additional personnel or technology costs. Most notably, new guidance on the calculation of credit reserves using current expected credit losses, referred to as CECL, was finalized in June 2016. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023. To implement the new standard, the Company will incur costs related to data collection and documentation, technology and training. For additional information, see \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. If the Company is required to materially increase the level of the allowance for loan losses or incurs additional expenses to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, such changes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital levels, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax rates applicable to the Company may cause impairment of deferred tax assets.\nThe Company determines deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method. Under this method, each asset and liability are examined to determine the difference between its book basis and its tax basis. The difference between the book basis and the tax basis of each asset and liability is multiplied by the Company\u2019s marginal tax rate to determine the net deferred tax asset or liability. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods.\nThe marginal tax rate applicable to the Company, as with all entities subject to federal income tax, is based on the Company\u2019s taxable income. If the Company\u2019s taxable income declines such that the Company\u2019s marginal tax rate declines, the change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities would result in an expense during the period that a lower marginal tax rate occurs. If changes in tax rates and laws are enacted, the Company will recognize the changes in the period in which they occur. Changes in tax rates and laws could impair the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and result in an expense associated with the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR index in the future.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. In November 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one-week and two-month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021, but the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 30, 2023. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, federal bank regulators have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly. Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nRegulators, industry groups, and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., SOFR, as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of any such alternatives may be on the value of LIBOR-based variable-rate loans, as well as LIBOR-based securities, subordinated notes, trust preferred securities, or other securities or financial arrangements. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under the Company\u2019s loan agreements with borrowers, subordinated notes that it has issued, or other financial arrangements may cause the Company to incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers or other counter-parties over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices may impose additional costs on the Company or expose it to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds, and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of the work force, and racial and social justice issues. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to the Company\u2019s overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and the Company\u2019s stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. The federal banking agencies have emphasized that climate-related risks are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes and are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks\u2019 risk management practices. In December 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published proposed principles for climate risk management by banking organizations with more than $100 billion in assets. The OCC also has appointed its first ever Climate Change Risk Officer and established an internal climate risk implementation committee in order to assist with these initiatives and to support the agency\u2019s efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. To the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to the Company, the Company would likely experience increased compliance costs and other compliance-related risks.\nThe lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact the Company. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio. Additionally, if insurance obtained by borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to borrowers, the collateral securing loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, which could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on customers and impact the communities in which the Company operates. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to The Company\u2019s Securities\nThe Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenue.\nThe Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through the Bank. As a result, the Company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its revenues. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company. Also, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, although the Company has historically paid a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock, holders of the common stock are not entitled to receive dividends, and regulatory or economic factors may cause the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other things, the reduction of dividends paid on the Company\u2019s common stock even if the Bank continues to pay dividends to the Company.\nThere is a limited trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock; it may be difficult to sell shares.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock has been relatively limited. Even if a more active market develops, there can be no assurance that a more active and liquid trading market for the common stock will exist in the future. Consequently, shareholders may not be able to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. In addition, the Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of its common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of the common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, could cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline, or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital through future sales of common stock. The lack of liquidity of the investment in the common shares should be carefully considered when making an investment decision.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional authorized shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, including in connection with acquisitions by the Company, could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of common stock and could be dilutive to shareholders. Because the Company\u2019s decision to issue common stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, it cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future issuances of its common stock. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk that future issuances will reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\nCurrent economic conditions or other factors may cause volatility in the Company\u2019s common stock value.\nThe value of publicly traded stocks in the financial services sector can be volatile. The value of the Company\u2019s common stock can also be affected by a variety of factors such as expected results of operations, actual results of operations, actions taken by shareholders, news or expectations based on the performance of others in the financial services industry and expected impacts of a changing regulatory environment. These factors not only impact the value of the Company\u2019s common stock but could also affect the liquidity of the stock given the Company\u2019s size, geographical footprint, and industry.\nFuture sales of our common stock by shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our common stock price to decline.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ Capital Market stock exchange, the trading volume in our common stock may be lower than that of other larger financial institutions. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the potential for lower relative trading volume in our common stock, significant sales of the common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of these sales or perceptions.\nThe Company\u2019s subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt are superior to its common stock, which may limit its ability to pay dividends on common stock in the future.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends on common stock is also limited by contractual restrictions under its subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Interest must be paid on the subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt before dividends may be paid to common shareholders. The Company is current in its interest payments on subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt; however, it has the right to defer distributions on its junior subordinated debt, during which time no dividends may be paid on its common stock. If the Company does not have sufficient earnings in the future and begins to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debt, it will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock until it becomes current on those distributions.\nThe Company\u2019s governing documents and Virginia law contain anti-takeover provisions that could negatively affect its shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions and the ability to set the voting rights, preferences, and other terms of any series of outstanding preferred stock and preferred stock that may be issued, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeovers (which certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interest). To the extent that such takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts may be inhibited. These provisions also could discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, even though such transactions may be favorable to the interests of shareholders and could potentially adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 18554, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FXNC"}
