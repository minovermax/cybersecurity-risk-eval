Business\nPEN\u2019s business is the marketing and sale of products enabled by nanotechnology. We develop and sell products based on our portfolio of intellectual property. Our current products are a portfolio of nano-layer coatings, nano-based cleaners, printable inks and pastes, and thermal management materials.\nPEN applies knowledge derived from our ongoing nanotechnology research and development to control and manipulate materials at the molecular level to solve everyday problems for customers in the optical, transportation, military, sports, and safety industries. New products under development are also targeted for sale to consumers and to other industries. Our primary commercial products center on our customized eye care glass cleaning and de-fogging products, precision mold release treatments, stay-clean surface treatments for ceramic surfaces, and scuff-resistant treatments for commercial dinnerware. We also sell: printable inks and pastes; thermal management materials; and, on a custom order basis, gas detectors and sensors. These products are marketed globally. We are also engaged in research and development under contract with the government and others with the goal of developing new and improved products using our proprietary technology.\nPEN is the surviving holding company from a business combination that closed on August 27, 2014 that we call the \u201cCombination\u201d. On that day (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), Applied Nanotech Holdings, Inc., a Texas corporation (\u201cApplied Nanotech Holdings\u201d), together with its wholly owned direct subsidiaries, PEN and NanoMerger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), completed a transaction with NanoHolding Inc. (\u201cNano\u201d). The Combination included three parts: (i) a redomestication of Applied Nanotech Holdings from Texas to Delaware by Applied Nanotech Holdings\u2019 merger into PEN, (ii) a subsequent merger of Nano into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub (n/k/a Nanofilm Holding Inc.) the surviving entity, and (iii) a subsequent exchange of 100% of Carl Zeiss, Inc.\u2019s interest in Nanofilm Ltd., Nano\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary (\u201cNanofilm\u201d), for stock in PEN. Nanofilm is a company formed under the laws of the Ohio on June 14, 1995 as a limited liability company and now a wholly owned subsidiary of PEN. PEN was formed in Delaware in February, 2014. It is the successor to Applied Nanotech Holdings that was founded in 1987, incorporated in Texas in 1989, and completed its initial public offering in 1993.\nAs part of the Combination, outstanding convertible notes of Applied Nanotech Holdings were converted into common stock, for which an aggregate of 32,379,288 shares of PEN Class A common stock were issued, and 11,164,620 shares of PEN Class A common stock were issued to directors of the Company in payment of accrued fees. PEN also issued 1,500,000 shares of Class A common stock in satisfaction of a note held by the former CFO of the Company and issued 6.8 million shares subject to forfeiture to the then COO and President, Dr Yaniv. Accordingly, immediately prior the next step, there were 203,363,059 PEN Class A shares outstanding.\nThe Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization of Nano. On the Effective Date, the pre-merger shares of Nanoholdings, Inc. were exchanged for an aggregate of 27,670,187 shares of Class A common stock of PEN and 250,698,105 shares of Class B common stock of PEN. In the final step of the Combination, the Class Z member interests of Nanofilm (the non-controlling interests) were exchanged for 47,273,470 Class Z shares of PEN. The effect of these exchanges is reflected retroactively in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nOur principal operating segments coincide with our different business activities and types of products sold. This is consistent with our internal reporting structure. Our two reportable segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 were (i) the Product Segment (which we formerly called the Nanofilm segment) and (ii) the Research and Development Segment. For the 2013 periods, the Company is NanoHolding Inc., the accounting acquirer; it only operated in the Product Segment.\nProduct Segment\nRevenue is based on the successful development of specialty products utilizing nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes at the surfaces of a wide variety of substrates. Our products are sold in liquid form enabling application by a number of common commercial techniques and in some instances also as wet and dry towelettes. We rely on intellectual property and or trade secret formulations to protect our proprietary technology.\nWe have three broad product technology platforms that offer solutions to some common problems such as ease of cleaning, preventing fogging, preventing accumulation of dirt or grime, improving resistance to scuffing and wear. All our products have some \u201cnano\u201d characteristic about them - whether it is being active at the molecular level, incorporation of submicron-particles, or creating very thin, self-assembling coatings that are 20 nanometers or less in thickness.\nOne line of commercial products center on our customized optical and eyewear cleaning and de-fogging treatments. Another is a family of coating liquids that create very thin, strongly-bound, clear coatings on surfaces used for glass and ceramic surfaces. The third product family is series of clear coatings for plastics incorporating submicron size particles to improve abrasion resistance and wear resistance without sacrificing transparency. Our goal continues to be to create segment leading brands through sales of high quality consumer products, and by developing and producing customized formulas for sale to strategic, industrial partners to be incorporated into their customer\u2019s products. We manufacture our formulations internally to protect our technology and maintain the highest quality for the products that we and our commercial partners bring to the marketplace.\nOur products encompass:\n\u25cf Liquid and towelette formulations packaged in many formats for retail sale to consumers for eyeglass and sunglass lens cleaning and protection.\n\u25cf Anti-fogging liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for safety glasses, protective eye wear including face shields, and sporting googles.\n\u25cf Anti-fogging towelettes for sale to the military for safety, anti-fogging and conditioning of lenses, masks, head gear and other applications such as head\u2019s up displays,\n\u25cf Mar resistant and stain resistant coatings for high end vitreous china tableware used for heavy duty, usage situations such as restaurants, cruise ships, casinos.\n\u25cf Clear protective coatings used on display panels and touch screens to make it easy to remove fingerprints. Applications include automotive and hand held devices.\n\u25cf Protective and water repelling coatings on interior glass - decorated glass panels, shower doors to make it easy to clean and prevent scale and grime encrustation.\n\u25cf Coatings for ceramic insulators used in transit and underground subways systems to prevent caking of metal dust and greases on surfaces to reduce maintenance and current leakage losses.\nNew products under development include products targeted to our current customer base in the optical, transportation, military, sports, and safety industries.\nSeparate from our historical business, we are also focused on creating products enabled by nanotechnology that tackle and solve big, global problems in growing markets. We have three primary areas of new product focus:\n1. Health: Treating or printing of surfaces at the nano-scale to promote health, fight the spread of disease, and assist in the arms race against super bugs;\n2. Safety: \u201cSmelling\u201d at the nano-scale level to identify hazardous condition, alert those in danger, and initiate steps to prevent catastrophe; and\n3. Sustainability: Creating nano-scale devices and formulas using the minimal amounts of safe, natural ingredients and manufacturing methods, and avoiding using harsh chemicals and pesticides, whenever possible.\nThe first new product is expected to be part of a family of cleaning products that clean and fortify surfaces at the nanoscale-level. We expect to be selling the first product from this work in the next several months. The patent-pending product is a spray cleaner that penetrates and fortifies the surface. This fortifier and protector can clean and protect many surfaces, both natural and man-made. After application, the product continues to fortify and protect, creating a healthy surface.\nOur product is made with safe ingredients and does not use harsh chemicals or disinfectants. We start with a natural mineral that is milled and engineered into a smaller shape and size. Then, the milled mineral is mixed with a proprietary cleaner solution to create our product. The mineral chosen is stable in air and water. No governmental approvals are required for sale of this product. The product:\n\u25cf rids surface of dust, dirt and debris;\n\u25cf leaves a healthy surface\n\u25cf is safe to use;\n\u25cf will continue to work for as long as it is on the surface (until cleaned or washed away);\n\u25cf is fast acting;\n\u25cf is non-corrosive;\n\u25cf is easy to apply;\n\u25cf is non-flammable;\n\u25cf is environmentally-friendly;\n\u25cf is odor-free; and\n\u25cf is stain-free.\nWe believe that our manufacturing capacity and contractors with whom we have established relationships will enable us to fill orders for the early sales. Ingredients and packaging materials are readily available from a number of suppliers. As sales increase, we will need to expand manufacturing, but we believe there are sufficient subcontractors that manufacturing will not be a problem. Initial sales will be done with individuals already under contract. Sales and marketing will be increased as resources permit. To plan for supporting this new product we have engaged the firm of INTLI FCStone Securities Inc. to explore a capital raise.\nMarketing and Distribution\nWe sell our current products directly to retailers in the United States and internationally, including manufacturers who utilize product formulations in their own branded products. For our new products to our traditional customer base, and for certain customers or market segments, we rely on outside sales agents or distributors.\nManufacturing Operations\nMost of our manufacturing is done at our 50,000 square foot facility in Valley View, Ohio. Additional manufacturing, packaging and assembly is done by third-party contract manufacturers in the United States, India and Taiwan.\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\nOur nanotechnology expertise and related intellectual property used in our current products is specialized in the areas of surface science, molecular self-assembly, transparent composites, and surfactants. The intellectual property developed from this work is protected with a combination of selective patents and primarily by trade secrets. This intellectual property strategy is similar to that used by leading companies in the fragrance and flavors industry. We have twenty four issued patents and two pending patent applications. No single patent is significant to any of our products.\nCompetition\nProducts sold into the optical segment and the eyewear cleaning segments have a small number of significant competitors. Our products are known to be the \u201cbenchmark\u201d products in these segments and generally outperform our competitors\u2019. Some of our products in these segments do compete for certain customers or certain applications against lower priced, traditional materials. Most of the companies selling products into these market segments are privately-held, U.S. packaging or catalog companies. Examples in the U.S. are include Hilco Accessories, California Accessories, and Amcon Laboratories and, internationally, the catalog company, Prosben, Inc., from the Peoples Republic of China. In the nano-coating products area or the anti-fog product line we are not aware of any competitive products that match our product performance or processing characteristics.\nBacklog\nSales are primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of products. We do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. Some agreements give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of products during a specified time period, but these agreements do not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity. The quantities actually purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer\u2019s needs. Because of our relatively small size, a customer\u2019s delay of a product shipment can make a difference in the results for a particular accounting period. For these reasons we do not believe that these agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts.\nGeographical Information\nAll long-lived assets are located in the United States.\nSources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers\nWe use third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers in the United States to obtain substantially all of our raw materials, components and packaging products. Over time, one unrelated third party has become our leading supplier in the United States. As is customary in our industry, historically we have not had long-term or exclusive agreements with third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers and have generally made purchases through purchase orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers and that there are alternative sources should one or more of these suppliers or manufacturers become unavailable. However, the disruption of our operations if a change becomes necessary and the likelihood of shipment delays means that the loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with, any of our key suppliers or manufacturers, or any other supply change disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nKey Customers\nA limited number of key customers account for a substantial portion of our commercial revenue. In particular, revenue from three customers constituted approximately 24 %, 16% and 10% respectively, of 2014 total revenue. Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and, therefore, may be able to exert a high degree of influence over us. The loss of one of the largest customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nResearch and Development Segment\nWe are a global leader in nanotechnology research and development and this segment focuses on generating revenues through performing research services. Our nanotechnology research is aimed at solving problems at the molecular level - working with the basic properties of matter to create new and improved materials and technologies. We do both research and development, including proof of concepts and prototypes, for proposed PEN products and research and development under contract for government and private entities. In our work on products for PEN we focus on using only the submicron size particles, not smaller nanoparticles that are subject to much greater government regulation. Our work generally falls under one of three technology platforms:\n\u25cf Nanosensor technology;\n\u25cf Nanoelectronics; and\n\u25cf Submicron particle formulations for health and safety products.\nWe continue to focus on stabilizing our financial situation and operating this segment at break-even or better based solely on revenues from our research activities.\nSince development of intellectual property has been a critical part of our strategy, before starting on, or accepting, a project, we analyze the potential to develop intellectual property. Following the Combination, an additional filter has been added and we also consider how the proposed research may tie in to existing products and manufacturing expertise in our Product Segment or to other potential, new products that we may choose to develop.\nMuch of our contract research is done under government contracts. Government contracts frequently limit profit on work done. With private research contracts there is a relationship between revenues received under the contract and rights granted to the licensee under the contract. Since a critical component of any research contract is for us to retain intellectual property rights, we must contribute to the overall cost of the project. Our goal on private research contracts is, at a minimum, to cover all out of pocket costs and contribute to our overall overhead.\nIn commercializing our technology, because of limited resources, we historically focused on licensing our technology to others. Our research partners frequently have licensing rights as a result of the research that they funded, and upon completion of the work, they will license the technology for specific applications. Following the Combination we are more focused on developing products that we can sell. We expect that licensing considerations will be less important for new contract research in the future. If we conclude that we are not in a good position to commercialize products from a particular part of our intellectual property portfolio, we may seek to realize value for that intellectual property by license arrangements or the sale of that intellectual property.\nWe have had small scale success with commercial sales of conductive inks and pastes and from thermal management materials. We expect to work to increase sales of those products as our resources permit.\nNanoelectronics Applications - Inks and Pastes\nMetallic Inks & Pastes\nCopper Inks - As a result of the move towards flexible electronics, soldering is disappearing. New digital processes allow industries to move from the design process directly to the production line. We believe that at this time, only submicron particles are capable of producing inks that are compatible with the nozzles used in digital printing.\nWe have had a long-standing relationship with Ishihara Chemical Company, Ltd., a leading industrial chemical products company headquartered in Japan, to develop conductive inks that can be deposited using an additive process such as ink-jet printing, aerosol-jet printing or screen printing. Our work with Ishihara started in early 2006 and in past years, we received over $2.5 million in research funding from Ishihara and a $1.5 million up-front license payment. Because of Ishihara\u2019s heavy financial commitment to the project, all intellectual property generated by the project is jointly owned by ANI and Ishihara and the license agreement signed in 2009 gave Ishihara the exclusive right to use this technology. Ishihara can choose to give up this exclusivity at any time. Ishihara may introduce a product at some point in the future, but not in 2015. We may at some point in the future receive royalties of up to 4% on Ishihara product sales. If, however, Ishihara chooses to give up its exclusivity, it will owe no future royalties.\nOther metallic inks - After our initial work in copper, we expanded our work with conductive inks to include nickel, silver, aluminum, and other inks, as well as conductive pastes. In particular, we have developed aluminum and silver inks and pastes that can improve the production of solar cells. We have also developed a highly efficient aluminum paste that can be used in solar cell production.\nIn 2011, we licensed our solar ink technology to Sichuan Anxian Yinhee Construction and Chemical Company (\u201cYHCC\u201d), a Chinese chemical company, for an upfront payment of $1.5 million. In 2012 and 2013 we received additional funds from YHCC totaling $1 million. An additional payment of $500,000 was paid in 2012, after we achieved certain technical standards. In 2014 we amended our agreements with YHCC, transferring certain solar-ink-related patents to an affiliate of YHCC and receiving back a royalty free license to use the patents in fields other than solar applications.\nThere are silver inks on the market today, but because of the high cost of silver relative to copper, a successful copper ink is likely to be of greater commercial interest to potential customers. Most inks and pastes sold today are manufactured and sold by large multinational chemical companies. For example, the two largest suppliers of inks and pastes for solar cell production are DuPont and Ferro. We are unable to compete directly with companies of that size in established markets.\nTechnical Inks Printing Solution (TIPS)\nConductive inks have the potential to revolutionize many types of electronics manufacturing. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive solution for end users not just by developing inks, but assisting in the process from start to finish. We call this our Technical Inks Printing Solution. We have done extensive research on the raw materials (submicron particles) and developed relationships with suppliers that allow us to supply a variety of submicron particles. In addition, we have studied a variety of potential end user products to help develop specifications for the inks. We have also formed relationships with hardware manufacturers with the goal of providing seamless integration into high volume manufacturing for companies wishing to use conductive inks in their manufacturing processes.\nNumerous other companies are working with other technologies for the commercial use of conductive inks and pastes. The commercialization of products using our technology depends on the results of our research compared with results achieved by others, as well as other factors including raw material costs, marketing, resources, and production capabilities.\nSensors\nOur approach to sensor technology offers the unique advantage of recognizing and sometimes measuring materials at the molecular level. We are pursuing a multiple technology platforms to address specific market needs. Some of these technologies were an area of increased focus in 2014 and that will continue in 2015. Our competition in the sensor area will come from a variety of technologies and companies depending on the purpose and use of the sensor. The areas where we are currently active are:\nIon Mobility Sensors. We are currently developing sensors based on Ion Mobility Sensor (\u201cIMS\u201d) technology focusing on Differential Mobility Spectroscopy (\u201cDMS\u201d). These sensors are ideal for use when both high sensitivity and high selectivity (low false positives) are required. We have also improved on existing IMS and DMS technology by developing our proprietary nonradioactive gas ionization sources to replace the radioactive isotopes that are currently used in these tools. We are currently involved in projects to develop highly sensitive Mercaptan and Methane sensors for use in the natural gas industry under funding from the Northeast Gas Association, and sensors for detection of citrus greening disease under funding from the California Citrus Research Board.\nWe have also applied this technology to other applications including other agricultural pathology areas, wound care, and breath analysis. For example, we have received NIH funding to develop technology for early detection of pressure ulcers (aka bed sores) in collaboration with the University of California - Davis. We are also funded by the NIH to develop a breath analyzer for detecting alcoholic hepatitis in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic. The U.S. Army is also funding work to identify pollen based on odor analysis for forensic applications. We are also funded by the USDA for developing rapid tests for food safety.\nHydrogen Sensors. These sensors were initially targeted for use in fuel cells for automobiles and for remote monitoring of large power transformers. We developed a hydrogen sensor for use in the measurement of hydrogen in power transformer products. We may explore options to realize the value of this sensor technology by sale or license to third parties.\nCarbon Monoxide Sensors. We have developed a low-power carbon monoxide sensor that can last for 10,000 hours on a single battery. The sensor will be specific to carbon monoxide with no cross sensitivity to other gases and elements and is also easily portable and highly sensitive.\nSubmicron Particles for Health and Safety Applications\nOur work in the health and safety area builds on our understanding of certain compounds from our extensive work related to inks and pastes. The understanding of the chemistry of these particles and their interaction with surfactants and other solutions was combined with research and development work done for products already sold commercially resulted in new product concepts and materials with superior properties for applications in the field of health and safety.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nAn important part of our overall business and product development strategy is to protect our intellectual property and we seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology through the use of patents. Historically, we made filings in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions. Beginning in 2014, as a cost saving measure, we became much more selective in filing patents and in the jurisdictions where we act to protect our rights with respect to work that is less likely to result in products that we can sell ourselves. Still, our patent portfolio consists of over 100 patents, including issued patents and patent applications pending before foreign and United States Patent and Trademark Offices. Trade secret protection is also important to our products.\nThe patenting of technology-related products and processes involves uncertain and complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards change from time to time, and administrative and court interpretations are not always consistent in one jurisdiction, or across different jurisdictions. Therefore, there is no assurance that our pending United States and foreign applications will issue, or what scope of protection any issued patents will provide, or whether any such patents ultimately will be upheld as valid by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a legal challenge. Interference proceedings, to determine priority of invention, also could arise in any of our pending patent applications. The costs of such proceedings would be significant and an unfavorable outcome could result in the loss of rights to the invention at issue in the proceedings. If we fail to obtain patents, and are required to rely on unpatented proprietary technology, there is no assurance that we can protect our rights in such unpatented proprietary technology, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.\nCompetitors have filed applications for, or have been issued patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes used in, necessary to, competitive with, or otherwise related to, our patents. The scope and validity of these patents, and the extent to which we may be required to obtain licenses under these patents or under other proprietary rights and the cost and availability of licenses is unknown. This may limit our ability to use and to license our technology. Litigation concerning these or other patents could be protracted and expensive. If suit were brought against us for patent infringement, a challenge in the suit by us as to the validity of the other patent would have to overcome a legal presumption of validity. There can be no assurance that the validity of the patent would not be upheld by the court or that, in such event, a license of the patent to us would be available. Moreover, even if a license were available, the payments that would be required are unknown and could materially reduce the value of our interest in the affected products. We do, however, consider our patents to be very strong and defendable in any action that may be brought against us.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets.\nWe require our employees, directors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while working for us will be our property. There is no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.\nGovernment Contracts\nA portion of our revenue consists of reimbursement of expenditures under U.S. government contracts. We recognized $504,130 of revenue from government contracts during the period after the Effective Date of the Combination until December 31, 2014. These reimbursements represent all or a portion of the costs associated with such contracts. As of December 31, 2014, we have several government contracts in process that have approximately $1.84 million of revenue yet to be recognized. Government contracts are subject to delays and risk of cancellation. Also, government contractors generally are subject to various kinds of audits and investigations by government agencies. These audits and investigations involve review of a contractor\u2019s performance on its contracts, as well as its pricing practices, the costs it incurs and its compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and standards. We have been audited by the government, with no material changes, and in the future we expect to be audited by the government; however we expect the results of any government audits to have an insignificant effect on our operations and our financial statements.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development activity is the driver of our new product development and improvement of existing products. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 research and development costs incurred in the development of the Company\u2019s products were $607,049 and $878,364 respectively This represents approximately 13% and 24% of our total operating costs in each of those years (prior to an impairment loss in 2014). The ability to engineer product performance using nanotechnology is one of the ways we distinguish our products in marketing and sales of our products. Research and development work includes development and refinement of formulas, engineering of liquid formulas that can be applied both by hand and by machine, optimization for a variety of performance characteristics, testing and characterization, and work on manufacturing processes and techniques both for producing the product, and for a customer\u2019s use of the product. As we worked to reduce our costs in 2014, we eliminated some unfunded research and development cost.\nMuch of our intellectual property and contract research relates to potential next-generation technologies. Significant additional development work is required before products can be commercialized using these technologies. Since the Combination we have started to analyze which areas in our intellectual property portfolio have a greater, near term potential to be commercialized and whether we, or others, are best suited to do so. That analysis is ongoing.\nCompliance with Environmental Laws\nOur products and manufacturing and research operations must satisfy governmental safety standards. Applicable safety standards are established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), pollution control standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and other state and local regulations, including foreign regulation for products manufactured or shipped outside the U.S. Some of our research work, and products developed may also be subject to regulation under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (\u201cCDRH\u201d) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We take these requirements into account in product development. Cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant in the past and we do not expect it to be material in the future.\nOSHA, the EPA, the CDRH and other governmental agencies, both in the United States, the states where we or our customers sell products, and foreign countries, may adopt additional rules and regulations that may affect us and products using our technology. The cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant to us in the past and is not expected to be material in the future. Changing regulations can affect our customers, and we have in the past, and may be required in the future, to reformulate or change packaging to address regulatory issues. This can affect timing of sales which may be significant in a particular accounting period.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2014 we had 34 full-time employees, plus 3 executive officers. At the present time, we do not anticipate the need to hire significant additional employees to support our existing business. If product sales increase, or we begin to see commercial sales of new products, we may hire additional employees. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks relating to PEN and our Business\nThe timeline for commercial sales of new products, the profit margins that new products can command and customer acceptance of new products, are all key to our success and all are unpredictable.\nWe plan to create new products using our intellectual property. To implement its plan, we must identify products that can benefit from our intellectual property, take the products from concept to prototype, and make and sell the new product commercially. Many factors affect a customer\u2019s acceptance of new products and many new product ideas are never realized. Many others never achieve commercial success. If we cannot develop and commercialize new products it will adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur strategy to commercialize new products from our intellectual property may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, any of which could adversely affect our results and negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nFew companies have been able to develop commercial products based on nanotechnology. Nanofilm, our subsidiary, under the leadership of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Rickert, has been successful with products of limited scope. Identifying new products that can be manufactured, marketed and sold at margins that justify the investment and then taking those products to market will take time. If we cannot successfully develop and sell products enhanced by nanotechnology, or if the process drags on, the value of PEN common stock may be affected adversely.\nThe failure to manage successfully our existing businesses while new products are under development until they can generate commercial sales may adversely affect our future results.\nOur management team must continue to manage current operations to give us time to accomplish our growth plans. At the same time, we must fund product development, create or contract for manufacturing capability, and establish sales, marketing and distribution for the new products. Disruptions or the failure to address changes in our current businesses could adversely affect ours results, financial condition and stock price.\nOur increased focus on commercializing products from our intellectual property library may affect our ability to attract funding for private research as we may be perceived as a potential competitor. At the same time, to support our research staff we need sufficient research projects to pay the expenses of the research segment and related salaries. The inability to obtain research funding could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have limited resources.\nWe are a small company with limited human and financial resources. Most of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial strength. Our limited resources will require that we limit the potential new products that we work on at any time and may limit our ability to tackle issues that arise in development, manufacturing, regulatory approvals or marketing. Our limited resources and potential constraints on our ability to take advantage of opportunities, may give competitors time to challenge our products in the marketplace and to bring pressure on us by devoting more resources to marketing and distribution that may make it harder for us to be successful with new products.\nNew products directed at new market sectors or to consumers are expected to require expenditures for sales and marketing greater than revenues from sales of new products. Some new products may also require patent protection in order to protect our technology and patent protection requires significant up-front cost before the marketplace success of the product can be known. To fund these expenses we will require additional financing and our results of operations and the value of our stock may be adversely affected if we cannot obtain additional funding when needed or on reasonable terms. In addition, delay in obtaining financing may adversely affect acceptance of the new products and may afford competitors the opportunity to respond or challenge our products that may also adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business plan contemplates the acquisition of businesses that have distribution channels and who know the customers for our new products to help us with marketing, sales and distribution, but our ability to negotiate those deals, the time required to close the deals, and the costs to accomplish these acquisitions are unknown.\nTo understand the potential market for new products, to better understand target customers, and to augment our resources to market and distribute new products, we expect to identify businesses that are already knowledgeable about the marketing, sales and distribution to target customers to accelerate sales of new products. Identifying those companies, negotiating the acquisition and integrating new personnel into the product development team must all happen for PEN\u2019s new products to benefit from these acquisitions. If we cannot identify, or cannot successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition of a product company, our ability to implement our business plan will be delayed either until an acquisition can be identified and consummated, until we can obtain the funding to create and grow our own marketing and distribution, or until a different product opportunity is identified where such an acquisition can be accomplished.\nOur acquisition strategy is expected to require additional capital, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent it from growing.\nTo fund acquisitions of product companies, to acquire technology to complete the development of new products, or to pay for sales and marketing of new products, PEN expects that it will be required to raise capital through public or private financings. If financing is not available on acceptable terms, or at all, PEN\u2019s failure to raise capital when needed could harm its business. Moreover, because there will not be earnings from new products for some period of time, financings are expected to be equity financings that will dilute the holders of PEN common stock.\nOur executive team has not previously worked together to lead a public company, and any inability of members of the executive team to work together effectively or the loss of any of them could adversely affect its performance.\nWhile the executive officers have significant experience, some do not have any experience working for a public company, and they have not worked together. None of the executives has experience as a manager of a public holding company with several operating subsidiaries. Moreover, our acquisition strategy will also mean that new key players will be expected to join the management team to accomplish the development, marketing, sales and distribution of new products. Our success will depend, in part, on the ability of our executives to work effectively as a team in this new environment. Any inability of our executive team to work together effectively or the loss of any of them, could impair PEN\u2019s ability to execute its strategy.\nPEN is disadvantaged by its relatively small size in selling into the optical industry, and its size also limits its ability to introduce its existing products to customers outside the optical industry.\nPEN is smaller in size than other companies that sell products into the optical industry. Larger companies may have a broader product line to offer customers and have the resources to put products into more distribution channels than we have the resources to pursue. Our size also means we has fewer resources to hire people to pursue sales and marketing opportunities for products to those and to other customers which inhibits our growth.\nSales to industrial customers that incorporate PEN products into their own product offerings make us dependent on our industrial customer\u2019s commitment and on its success.\nSome of our existing products are, and potential new products may also be, sold to industrial customers that incorporate our product into their own products for their customers. This means the success of our product is dependent on the level of support, marketing and customer assistance provided by our industrial customer, and we cannot control timing, marketing or introduction of our products or improved products, the timing or methods used to address customer concerns, and we cannot directly affect marketing or distribution of the products or services that incorporate our products. If our industrial customer has other priorities or is unsuccessful in its marketing or its customer service, the sales of our products and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nTerms of secured debt make PEN vulnerable if operational issues adversely impact its working capital.\nNanofilm redeemed a majority in number of its members in 2012 and took on secured debt in 2013 to pay notes issued to some former members in the redemption. That debt was refinanced in April 2014. PEN must comply with the terms of the debt agreements in order to borrow for its regular working capital needs. Customer decisions to delay shipments, disruption in the supply chain or other operating difficulties that increase the inventory on hand or that delay collection of accounts receivable could mean that the lender will no longer advance funds and PEN could need different terms from its lender or might need to curtail its business.\nPEN\u2019s products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may subject it to claims, or prevent or delay its product development efforts and stop it from selling or increase the costs of its products.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. If claims are made that we are using third party technology without authorization or that any third-party patents cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents or other intellectual property may be able to block the sale of our products unless we obtain a license or changes the products so as not to use the third-party\u2019s intellectual property. We could incur significant costs defending against any claim, and, if we is liable, we may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or redesign the products at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nPEN relies on trade secrets to protect its proprietary know-how and technology, especially where PEN does not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Others may independently develop the same or similar technology, or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary technology. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information and to develop products that better compete with our products.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights necessary to defend PEN or enforce its rights will be costly and time consuming.\nOur ability to defend our intellectual property may require litigation to enforce our rights or to defend litigation brought by a third-party. Any of these lawsuits, regardless of their success, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and may require delay or suspension of commercial sales while they are pending. The cost could cause us to forego litigation or to settle on terms that are disadvantageous. If litigation is undertaken or defended, that attendant cost or delay could have a material, adverse impact on PEN\u2019s results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in sales and marketing and may be unable to successfully commercialize new products, and it will take time and may be difficult to build brand loyalty.\nOur marketing, sales and distribution experience and capabilities are limited. Our ability to achieve success with new products depends on successfully marketing products and attracting customers and building brand loyalty. To successfully perform sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions we have strengthened our management team and plan to make strategic acquisitions, but if we cannot accomplish that, may be forced to endeavor to accomplish this ourselves. If that occurs, we will face a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf The time and cost of creating a sales and marketing team and sales force\n\u25cf The time and cost of creating a sales and marketing program for a new product\n\u25cf The risk that competitors react to challenge new products that we introduce with increased sales and marketing, promotions and advertising\n\u25cf The time and cost to identify and convince customers to purchase a new product\n\u25cf The time and cost to create brand awareness and loyalty for new products\nEven if we are successful in acquiring a product company with relevant sales, marketing and distribution capability, the expertise will need to be applied to our products, and methods may need to be changed to be successful with our products.\nSome of our technology development is in its early stages and the viability of commercial products is uncertain\nSome of our applications of our intellectual property, and certain products that use these technologies, will require significant additional development, engineering, testing and investment prior to commercialization. We are exploring the use of our technology in several different types of products. We have developed proof of concepts of potential products based on some of our technologies, others are not that far in the process. It is uncertain whether commercially viable products can be developed from a number of our technologies, the size of the potential customer base, and the resources that will be required to develop, test, standardize, manufacture, market, distribute and sell these potential products. Evaluating the potential commercial uses of a product under development is a matter of judgment, and mistakes would reduce the resources available for other potential products and delay commercialization which would adversely affect our results of operations and may require us to seek additional capital that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur development partners have certain rights to jointly developed property and to license our technology.\nIn several cases involving our sensor technologies, we have committed to license our technology to our development partners in designated fields of use upon completion of certain development projects that are in process. Whether we can be the development partner, and the terms of these licenses have not yet been finalized. Our development partners usually also have rights to jointly developed intellectual property; however, any such jointly developed property would likely be based, at least in part, on our underlying technology which would require our partners to enter into a license agreement with us.\nSome health effects of nanotechnology are unknown.\nThere is scientific debate on the health effects of nanomaterials, but some scientists believe that certain nanomaterials may be hazardous to human health or the environment. The science of nanotechnology is engineering at the molecular level to modify or build materials. Many nano-materials are found in nature, others are not naturally occurring. The health effect of new materials is unknown, and can depend on how they are incorporated and bonded to other materials. We carefully evaluate potential health effects of our products on our customers and the effects of handling materials on our employees and those who manufacture for us. We are very mindful of the risks of materials we use and focus on health and safety. However, the ongoing debate about the health effects of nanoparticles and nanotechnology and increasing government regulation for some nano materials may adversely affect market acceptance of our products and adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThere has been little trading of our common stock, and an active trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nAlthough our Class A common stock is listed on the OTCQB; volume has been small. An active trading market for shares of our common stock may never develop or be sustained. If no trading market develops, securities analysts may not initiate or maintain research coverage of our company, which could further depress the market for our common stock. As a result, investors may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the time that they would like to sell. The limited market for our shares may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional shares and our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our common stock as consideration.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors and subject us to securities class action litigation.\nIf an active market for our stock develops and continues, our stock price nevertheless may be volatile. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variance in our financial performance from the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u25cf changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u25cf failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\n\u25cf conditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u25cf changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u25cf success of competitive products and services;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions;\n\u25cf the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u25cf recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf actual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders; and\n\u25cf the trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the OTCQB and the market for emerging growth companies or nanotechnology companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe liquidity of the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. At present, no analysts follow our stock. If that should change, the price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nPEN does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends. As a result, stockholders can expect to receive a return on our Class A common stock only if the market price of the stock increases.\nOur Chairman and CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock.\nScott Rickert, our Chairman and CEO has the power to vote all the Class B common stock of PEN, representing approximately 46% of the outstanding PEN common stock and approximately 99% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Rickert has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to PEN stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Under the terms of the Rickert Family, Limited Partnership, at the time of his death, control will transfer to his wife Jeanne Rickert. As a board member and officer, Mr. Rickert owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Rickert is entitled to vote as the general partner of Rickert Family, Limited Partnership in the interest of the Rickert family, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws will:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u25cf limit the persons who can call special stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf permit written action by voting stockholders, permitting Scott Rickert acting alone to accomplish most stockholder actions;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements to nominate persons for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u25cf provide for the filling of vacancies on our board of directors by action of a majority of the directors and not by the stockholders.\nThese and other provisions in our organizational documents could allow our board of directors to affect your rights as a stockholder in a number of ways, including making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for approving the appointment of members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current management team. These provisions could also limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our share price.\nSales of substantial shares of our common stock in the public market following a capital raise, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT\nThis document contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
