RISK FACTORS.\nWe operate in a competitive business environment that is influenced by conditions some of which are controllable and others are beyond our control. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the regional economy, monetary policy, and the political and regulatory environment. The following summarizes important risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business in the future.\nThe Baker family currently owns a majority of our voting stock and controls the company. Such control affects our corporate governance, and could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company.\nThe Baker family group, consisting of three current directors Peter Baker (CEO), John Baker (Executive Vice President) and Ross Rapaport (Chairman), as trustee, together own a majority of our common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders, acting together, can exert a controlling influence over the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation, mergers and various other matters. The concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company.\nAs permitted under the corporate governance rules of the NYSE MKT, we have, at the direction of the Baker family group, elected \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status under those rules. A controlled company is exempted from these NYSE MKT corporate governance rules: (1) the requirement that a listed company have a majority of independent directors, (2) the requirement that nominations to the company\u2019s board of directors be either selected or recommended by a nominating committee consisting solely of independent directors, and (3) the requirement that officers\u2019 compensation be either determined or recommended by a compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors. We do not currently utilize exemption (3) as we have a compensation committee consisting solely of three independent directors.\nThe personal interests of our directors and officers create conflicts.\nAs mentioned above, the Baker family group owns a majority of our common stock. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Crystal Rock Spring Water Company in 2000, we issued members of the Baker family group 12% subordinated promissory notes secured by all of our assets. As of October 31, 2017, the balance on these notes is $4,500,000. We also lease important facilities in Watertown and Stamford, Connecticut from Baker family interests. These interests of the Baker family create various conflicts of interest. Transactions between the Company and related parties are subject to review and approval by the Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors.\nWe face significant competition in the home and office distribution business from companies with greater resources than we have. Methods of competition in the distribution of home and office refreshment products continue to change and evolve. If we are unable to meet these changes, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets. The principal methods of competition in the markets in which we compete are distribution capabilities, brand recognition, quality, reputation, and price. We have a significant number of competitors in our traditional water market, some of which have far greater resources than us. Among our principal competitors are Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, DS Services of America, Inc., a segment of Cott Corporation, W.B. Mason, large regional brands owned by private groups, and local competitors in the markets that we serve. As we expanded our product lines, most notably to office products, we learned that price reductions and the introduction of new products by our competitors can adversely affect our revenues, gross margins, and profits.\nOur industry has also been affected by the increasing availability of water coolers in discount retail outlets. This has negatively affected our rental revenue stream in recent years as more customers choose to purchase coolers rather than rent them. We do not expect retail sales to replace rentals completely because we believe that the purchase option does not provide the quality and service that many customers want. However, third party retail cooler sales may continue to impact our rental revenues negatively in the future.\nInternet technology and virtual stores have lowered the barriers of entry into non-water marketplace we service.\nE-commerce businesses have added an additional layer of competition from product resellers who do not require investment in brick and mortar facilities and trucks. The lack of investment in physical assets has allowed these competitors to reduce overhead costs and subsequently sell products at a lower cost. These competitors generally will have products delivered to customers using third party distribution systems. While we have not seen an increase in competition in the bottled water products from virtual stores, we have seen increased competition in coffee and office product items.\nWe rely upon a single software vendor that supplies the software for our route accounting and online storefront ordering systems, which exposes us to risk from interruption of service.\nOur route accounting and online ordering systems are essential to our overall administrative function and success. An extended interruption in servicing the system could result in the inability to access information. Limited or no access to this information would likely inhibit the sale and distribution of our products and the availability of management information, and could even affect our compliance with public reporting requirements. Our software vendor has a limited number of staff possessing the proprietary information pertaining to the operation of the software. Changes in personnel or ownership in the firm might result in disruption of service. Such changes would be addressed by retaining a new vendor to service the existing software or purchasing a new system, but we cannot assure you that we could implement successfully a new vendor or new system without possible disruption to our business and added cost. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nWe depend upon maintaining the integrity of our water sources and manufacturing process. If our water sources or bottling processes were contaminated for any reason, our business would be seriously harmed.\nOur ability to retain customers and the goodwill associated with our brands is dependent upon our ability to maintain the integrity of our water resources and to guard against defects in, or tampering with, our manufacturing process. The loss of integrity in our water sources or manufacturing process could lead to product recalls and/or customer illnesses that could materially adversely affect our goodwill, market share and revenues. Because we rely upon natural spring sites for sourcing some of our water supply, acts of God, such as earthquakes, could alter the geologic formation of the spring sites, constricting or even contaminating water flow.\nIn addition, we do not own any of our water sources. Although we believe the long term rights to our spring and municipal sources are well secured, any dispute over these rights that resulted in prolonged disruption in supply could cause an increase in cost of our product or shortages that would not allow us to meet the market demand for our product.\nThe bottled water industry is regulated at both the state and federal level. If we are unable to continue to comply with applicable regulations and standards in any jurisdiction, we might not be able to sell our products in that jurisdiction, and our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe FDA regulates bottled water as a food. Our bottled water must meet FDA requirements of safety for human consumption, labeling, processing and distribution under sanitary conditions and production in accordance with FDA \u201cgood manufacturing practices.\u201d In addition, all drinking water must meet Environmental Protection Agency standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act for mineral and chemical concentration and drinking water quality and treatment, which are enforced by the FDA. We also must meet state regulations in a variety of areas. These regulations set standards for approved water sources and the information that must be provided and the basis on which any therapeutic claims for water may be made. We have received approval for our drinking water in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. However, we can give no assurance that we will receive such approvals in the future.\nLegislative and executive action in state and local governments banning the use of municipal funds for purchasing bottled water, enacting local taxes on bottled water or water extraction, and restricting water withdrawal and usage rights from public and private sources could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRecent initiatives have taken place in several major cities regarding bottled water, principally the smaller sizes sold in stores to retail consumers. Regulations have been proposed in some localities that would ban the use of public funds to purchase bottled water, enact local taxes on bottled water or water extraction, and restrict the withdrawal of water from public and private sources. These actions are purportedly designed to discourage the use of bottled water due in large part to concerns about the environmental effects of producing and discarding large numbers of plastic bottles. In developing these stories, local and national media have reported on the growth of the bottled water industry and on the pros and cons of consuming bottled water as it relates to solid waste disposal and energy consumption in manufacturing, as well as conserving the supply of water available to the public.\nWe believe that the adverse publicity associated with these reports is generally aimed at the retail, small bottle segment of the industry that is now a minimal part of our business, and that our customers can readily distinguish our products from the retail bottles that are currently the basis for concern in some areas. Our customers typically buy their water in reusable five-gallon containers that are placed on coolers and reused many times. Only approximately 4% of our total sales are from water sold in single serve packages. In addition, we continue to take steps to \u201cgreen\u201d our business by means of solar electricity generation, high efficiency lighting, no-idling and other driving policies, and the use of biodiesel.\nWhile we believe that to date we have not directly experienced any adverse effects from these concerns, and that our products are sufficiently different from those under scrutiny, there is no assurance that adverse publicity about any element of the bottled water industry will not affect consumer behavior by discouraging buyers from buying bottled water products generally. In that case, our sales and other financial results could be adversely affected.\nClimate changes and severe weather may impact future ability to bottle water products and deliver all of our products.\nThere has been increasing concerns in recent years regarding climate change and the impact on water supplies. Most recently there have been drought conditions throughout much of our delivery areas. Should severe drought conditions exist, there may be restrictions on municipal water supplies used for the bottling of our Crystal Rock\u00ae branded water.\nIn addition, severe weather conditions during winter months in the northeast such as snow and ice storms significantly impact delivery schedules and revenue streams.\nOur Company is significantly leveraged. Over the years, we have borrowed substantial amounts of money to finance acquisitions. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations to our senior and subordinated lenders, we would be in default under those obligations, and that could hurt our business or even result in foreclosure, reorganization or bankruptcy.\nAt October 31, 2017 and 2016, our outstanding senior debt was $10,133,000 and $9,733,000, respectively, and our outstanding subordinated debt was $4,500,000 and $9,000,000 respectively. The underlying loans are secured by substantially all of our assets. If we do not repay our indebtedness in a timely fashion, our secured creditors could declare a default and foreclose upon our assets, which would result in harmful disruption to our business, the sale of assets for less than their fully realizable value, and possible bankruptcy. We must generate enough cash flow to service this indebtedness until maturity.\nFluctuations in interest rates could significantly increase our expenses. We will have significant interest expense for the foreseeable future, which in turn may increase or decrease due to interest rate fluctuations. To partially mitigate this risk, we have used swaps to establish fixed interest rates on a portion of our outstanding senior term debt.\nAs a result of our large amount of debt, we may be perceived by banks and other lenders to be highly leveraged and close to our borrowing ceiling. Until we repay some of our debt, our ability to access additional capital may be limited. In turn, that may limit our ability to finance transactions and to grow our business. In addition, our senior credit agreement limits our ability to incur incremental debt without our lender\u2019s permission.\nFluctuations in the cost of essential raw materials and commodities, including fuel costs, for the manufacture and delivery of our products could significantly impact our business.\nBottle manufacturers use plastic and other petroleum-based products for the manufacturing of our bottles. Increases in the cost of petroleum will likely have an impact on our bottle costs.\nWe rely on trucking to receive raw materials and transport and deliver our finished products. Consequently, the price of fuel significantly impacts the cost of our products. We purchase our own fuel for our Home and Office delivery and use third parties for transportation of raw materials and finished goods between our warehouses. While volume purchases can help control erratic fuel pricing, market conditions ultimately determine the price. In the past, we have experienced substantial market fluctuation of fuel prices. However, when fuel prices have increased, we have been able to establish a fuel adjustment charge for our customers that covered the incremental rising cost of fuel. When fuel prices have decreased, they have not decreased enough to offset the incremental fuel cost over what we considered our \u201cbase\u201d level for fuel cost. The risk remains that we may not be able to use fuel price adjustments to cover the cost of fuel increases in a volatile market for petroleum products, which could adversely affect our profitability. Further, limitations on the supply or availability of fuel could inhibit our ability to get raw materials and distribute our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our sales is derived from coffee. The supply and price of coffee may be limited by climate, by international political and economic conditions, and by access to transportation, combined with consumer demand. An increase in the wholesale price of coffee could result in a reduction in our profitability. If our ability to purchase coffee were impaired by a market shortage, our sales might decrease, which would also result in a reduction of profitability and customer satisfaction.\nOur success depends on the continued services of key personnel.\nOur continued success will depend in large part upon the expertise of our senior management and their ability to execute our strategic planning. Peter Baker, our Chief Executive Officer and President, John Baker, our Executive Vice President, and David Jurasek, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary, have entered into employment agreements with Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc. These \u201cat will\u201d employment agreements do not prevent these employees from resigning. The departure or loss of any of these executives individually could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and could contribute to disruption of our business while we searched for replacement personnel with appropriate skills.\nWe have a limited amount of bottling capacity. Significant interruptions of our bottling facilities could adversely affect our business.\nWe own three bottling facilities, and also contract with third parties, to bottle our water. If any of these facilities were incapacitated for an extended period of time, we would likely have to relocate production to an alternative facility. The relocation and additional transportation could increase the cost of our products or result in product shortages that would reduce sales. Higher costs and lower sales would reduce profitability.\nOur customer base is located in New England, New York and New Jersey. If there were to be a material decline in the economy in these regions, our business would likely be adversely affected.\nEssentially all of our sales are derived from New England, New York and New Jersey. We believe that the economic recession experienced in these areas, particularly in 2008 and 2009, adversely affected our financial results. Connecticut particularly has experienced difficulties recovering after the recession. Continued adverse effects in the regional economies, or a significant negative change in the economy of any of these regions, changes in consumer spending in these regions, or the entry of new competitors into these regional markets, among other factors, could result in a decrease in our sales and, as a result, reduced profitability.\nOur business is seasonal, which may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, the period from June to September represents the peak period for sales and revenues due to increased consumption of cold beverages during the summer months in our core Northeastern United States markets. Warmer weather in our geographic markets tends to increase water sales, and cooler weather tends to decrease water sales. To the extent that our quarterly results are affected by these patterns, our stock price may fluctuate to reflect them.", "PERMNO": 78216, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "CRVP"}
