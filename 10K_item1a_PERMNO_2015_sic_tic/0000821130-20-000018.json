Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include those set forth below under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Each of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. However, such factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. U.S. Cellular undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K to understand the material risks relating to U.S. Cellular\u2019s business.\nRisk Factors\n1)\nIntense competition in the markets in which U.S. Cellular operates could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues or increase its costs to compete.\nCompetition in the wireless industry is intense and is expected to intensify in the future due to multiple factors such as increasing market penetration, introduction of new products, new competitors and changing prices. There is competition in service plan pricing; handsets and other devices; network quality, coverage, speed and technologies, including 5G technology; distribution; new entrants; bundled services and products, such as content; and other categories. In particular, wireless competition includes aggressive service plan and device pricing, including pricing for unlimited plans, which could result in switching activity and churn. In addition, competition based on network speed may increase as customer demand for higher speeds increases. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the telecommunications industry. In addition, unlimited plans and other data pricing constructs across the industry may limit U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to monetize future growth in data usage. U.S. Cellular anticipates that these competitive factors may cause the prices for services and products to decline and the costs to compete to increase.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s primary competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are larger than U.S. Cellular, possess greater financial and other resources, possess more extensive coverage areas and more spectrum within their coverage areas, and market other services with their communications services that U.S. Cellular does not offer. U.S. Cellular's competitors are actively marketing their deployment of 5G and, as a result, are raising consumer awareness of the technology. If U.S. Cellular cannot keep pace with its competitors in deploying 5G or other comparable offerings, or if U.S. Cellular's deployment of 5G technology does not result in significant incremental revenues, U.S. Cellular's financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected. Further, other companies that currently are less competitive may also add more efficient low-band spectrum to become more competitive in U.S. Cellular\u2019s primary markets. In particular, to the extent that existing competitors or new entrants acquire low-band (e.g., 600 MHz) spectrum or deploy newer wireless technologies in U.S. Cellular markets, U.S. Cellular could face increased competition over time. In addition, U.S. Cellular may face competition from technologies that may be introduced in the future. New technologies, services and products that are more commercially effective than the technologies, services and products offered by U.S. Cellular may be developed. Further, new technologies may be proprietary such that U.S. Cellular is not able to adopt such technologies. There can be no assurance that U.S. Cellular will be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nSources of competition to U.S. Cellular\u2019s business typically include two to five competing wireless telecommunications service providers in each market, wireline telecommunications service providers, cable companies, resellers (including MVNOs), and providers of other alternate telecommunications services. Many of U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless competitors and other competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources than U.S. Cellular.\nIf U.S. Cellular does not adapt to compete effectively in such a highly competitive environment, such competitive factors could result in product, service, pricing or cost disadvantages and could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n2)\nA failure by U.S. Cellular to successfully execute its business strategy (including planned acquisitions, spectrum acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges) or allocate resources or capital effectively could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular is a regional wireless carrier, but competes primarily against much larger national wireless carriers with much greater resources. Its business strategy in attempting to attract and retain wireless customers through a value proposition comprised of a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans and pricing, all provided with a local focus has not resulted in, and in the future may not result in, performance that achieves returns in line with or above its cost of capital. U.S. Cellular\u2019s current forecast indicates that U.S. Cellular will not achieve a return on capital that exceeds its cost of capital in the foreseeable future. U.S. Cellular also might be unable to adopt technologies, services and products as fast as its larger competitors. As a result, consumers who are eager to adopt new technologies, services and products more quickly may select U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors rather than U.S. Cellular as their service provider. To the extent that U.S. Cellular does not attract or retain these types of customers, U.S. Cellular could be at a competitive disadvantage and have a customer base that generates lower profit margins relative to its competition.\nThe successful execution of strategy and optimal capital allocation decisions depend on various factors, many of which are not in U.S. Cellular\u2019s control. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to achieve projected financial results by implementing and executing its business strategy and optimally allocating its assets and capital could be affected by such factors. Such factors include but are not limited to pricing practices by competitors, relative scale, purchasing power, roaming and other strategic agreements, wireless device availability, timing of introduction of wireless devices, access to spectrum, emerging technologies, changes in tax or import tariff regulations and other factors. In addition, there is no assurance that U.S. Cellular\u2019s strategy will be successful. Even if U.S. Cellular executes its business strategy as intended, such strategy may not be successful in the long term at achieving growth in customers, revenues, net income, or generating a return on capital greater than U.S. Cellular\u2019s cost of capital. A failure by U.S. Cellular to execute its business strategy successfully or to allocate resources or capital optimally could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless business, financial condition or results of operations.\n3)\nUncertainty in U.S. Cellular\u2019s future cash flow and liquidity or the inability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, other changes in U.S. Cellular\u2019s performance or market conditions, changes in U.S. Cellular\u2019s credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to U.S. Cellular, which could require U.S. Cellular to reduce its construction, development or acquisition programs, reduce the amount of wireless spectrum licenses acquired, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases.\nU.S. Cellular operates a capital-intensive business. Historically, U.S. Cellular has used internally-generated funds and also has obtained substantial funds from external sources for general corporate purposes. In the past, U.S. Cellular\u2019s existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, funds from other financing sources, including a term loan and other long-term debt, and cash flows from operating and certain investing and financing activities, including sales of assets or businesses, provided sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for U.S. Cellular to meet its normal day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements, to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets and to fund acquisitions. There is no assurance that this will be the case in the future. It may be necessary from time to time to increase the amount of permissible borrowings under the existing revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, to put in place new credit agreements, or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund potential expenditures. U.S. Cellular\u2019s liquidity would be adversely affected if, among other things, U.S. Cellular is unable to obtain short or long-term financing on acceptable terms, U.S. Cellular makes significant spectrum license purchases, U.S. Cellular makes significant capital investments, U.S. Cellular makes significant business acquisitions, the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership (LA Partnership) discontinues or significantly reduces distributions compared to historical levels, or Federal USF and/or other regulatory support payments decline.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s credit rating currently is sub-investment grade. U.S. Cellular has incurred negative free cash flow (defined as Cash flows from operating activities less Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment) at times in the past and this could occur in the future. U.S. Cellular may require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, funding day-to-day operating needs including working capital, acquisitions of providers of wireless telecommunications services, spectrum license or system acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, the repurchase of shares, or making additional investments. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will continue to be available to U.S. Cellular or its subsidiaries on terms or at prices acceptable to U.S. Cellular. Insufficient cash flows from operating activities, changes in U.S. Cellular's credit ratings, defaults of the terms of debt or credit agreements, uncertainty of access to capital, deterioration in the capital markets, reduced regulatory capital at banks which in turn limits their ability to borrow and lend, other changes in the performance of U.S. Cellular or in market conditions or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to U.S. Cellular, which could require U.S. Cellular to reduce its acquisition, capital expenditure and business development programs, reduce the acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases. U.S. Cellular cannot provide assurance that circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or capital resources will not occur. Any of the foregoing would have an adverse impact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n4)\nU.S. Cellular has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial performance and in turn adversely affect its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, comply with terms of debt covenants and incur additional debt.\nU.S. Cellular has a significant amount of indebtedness and may need to incur additional indebtedness. U.S. Cellular\u2019s level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it (i) may limit U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to its debt securities by rating organizations are revised downward; (ii) will require U.S. Cellular to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on its debt, thereby reducing the funds available to U.S. Cellular for other purposes including expansion through acquisitions, capital expenditures, marketing spending and expansion of its business; and (iii) may limit U.S. Cellular\u2019s flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make U.S. Cellular more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on its indebtedness or to refinance it will depend on its financial and operating performance which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and other factors beyond its control. In addition, U.S. Cellular\u2019s leverage may put it at a competitive disadvantage to some of its competitors that are not as leveraged.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s revolving credit agreement, term loan agreement and receivables securitization agreement require U.S. Cellular to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants. Depending on the actual financial performance of U.S. Cellular, there is a risk that U.S. Cellular could fail to satisfy the required financial covenants. If U.S. Cellular breaches a financial or other covenant of any of these agreements, it would result in a default under that agreement, and could involve a cross-default under other debt instruments. This could in turn cause the affected lenders to accelerate the repayment of principal and accrued interest on any outstanding debt under such agreements and, if they choose, terminate the agreement. If appropriate, U.S. Cellular may request the applicable lenders for an amendment of financial covenants in the U.S. Cellular agreements, in order to provide additional financial flexibility to U.S. Cellular, and may also seek other changes to such agreements. There is no assurance that the lenders will agree to any amendments. If the lenders agree to amendments, this may result in additional payments or higher interest rates payable to the lenders and/or additional restrictions. Restrictions in such debt instruments may limit U.S. Cellular\u2019s operating and financial flexibility.\nAs a result, U.S. Cellular\u2019s level of indebtedness, restrictions contained in debt instruments and/or possible breaches of covenants, defaults, and acceleration of indebtedness could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n5)\nChanges in roaming practices or other factors could cause U.S. Cellular's roaming revenues to decline from current levels, roaming expenses to increase from current levels and/or impact U.S. Cellular's ability to service its customers in geographic areas where U.S. Cellular does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s service revenues include roaming revenues related to the use of U.S. Cellular\u2019s network by other carriers\u2019 customers who travel within U.S. Cellular\u2019s coverage areas. Changes in FCC rules or actions, industry practices or the network footprints of carriers due to mergers, acquisitions or network expansions could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s roaming revenues. For example, consolidation among other carriers which have network footprints that currently overlap U.S. Cellular\u2019s network could decrease the amount of roaming revenues for U.S. Cellular.\nSimilarly, U.S. Cellular's customers can access another carrier\u2019s network automatically only if the other carrier allows U.S. Cellular's customers to roam on its network. U.S. Cellular relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S. and internationally outside of its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of U.S. Cellular's network footprint. Such agreements cover traditional voice services as well as data services. Although U.S. Cellular currently has long-term roaming agreements with certain other carriers, these agreements generally are subject to renewal and termination if certain events occur. FCC rules and orders impose certain requirements on wireless carriers to offer certain roaming arrangements to other carriers. However, carriers frequently disagree on what is required. Although U.S. Cellular has entered into roaming agreements with national carriers, there is no assurance that U.S. Cellular will be able to maintain these agreements and/or enter into new agreements with other carriers to provide roaming services or that it will be able to do so on reasonable or cost-effective terms.\nSome competitors may be able to obtain lower roaming rates than U.S. Cellular is able to obtain because they have larger data usage or call volumes or may be able to reduce roaming charges by providing service principally over their own networks. In addition, the quality of service that a wireless carrier delivers to a U.S. Cellular customer while roaming may be inferior to the quality of service U.S. Cellular provides, the price charged by U.S. Cellular for an international roaming call may not be competitive with prices other wireless carriers charge for such call, U.S. Cellular\u2019s customers may not be able to use some of the advanced features that U.S. Cellular\u2019s customers enjoy when making calls on U.S. Cellular\u2019s network (e.g., voicemail notification or data applications), and U.S. Cellular customers\u2019 service experience may be negatively impacted, particularly when accessing data services, upon reaching a defined allotment of high-speed usage. U.S. Cellular\u2019s rate of adoption of new technologies, such as those enabling high-speed data and voice services, could affect its ability to enter into or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers. In addition, U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless technology may not be compatible with technologies used by other carriers, which may limit the ability of U.S. Cellular to enter into voice or data roaming agreements with such other carriers. Carriers whose customers roam on U.S. Cellular\u2019s network could switch their business to new operators, limit their high-speed usage or, over time, move traffic to their own networks. Changes in roaming usage patterns, rates for roaming usage, or roaming relationships with other carriers could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s roaming revenues and/or expenses.\nTo the extent that other carriers expand their networks in U.S. Cellular\u2019s service areas, the roaming arrangements between U.S. Cellular and these other carriers could become less strategic for them. That is, these other carriers will have fewer or less extensive geographic areas where roaming services are required by their customers and, as a result, the roaming arrangements could become less critical to serving their customer base. This presents a risk to U.S. Cellular in that, to the extent U.S. Cellular is not able to enter into economically viable roaming arrangements with these other carriers, this could impact U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to service its customers in geographic areas where U.S. Cellular does not have its own network.\nIf U.S. Cellular\u2019s roaming revenues decline, or its roaming expenses increase, or if U.S. Cellular is unable to obtain or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers that contain pricing and other terms that are competitive and acceptable to U.S. Cellular and that satisfy U.S. Cellular\u2019s quality and interoperability requirements, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n6)\nA failure by U.S. Cellular to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business depends on the ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. U.S. Cellular could fail to obtain access to sufficient spectrum capacity, including spectrum needed to support 5G technology, in new or existing markets, whether through FCC auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the anticipated spectrum requirements associated with increased demand for existing services, especially increases in customer demand for data services, and to enable deployment of next-generation services. U.S. Cellular believes that this increased demand for data services reflects a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future. Data usage, including usage under unlimited plans, could exceed current forecasts resulting in a need for increased investment in spectrum or network. U.S. Cellular could fail to accurately forecast its future spectrum requirements considering changes in plan offerings, customer usage patterns, technology requirements and the expanded demands of new services. Such a failure could have an adverse impact on the quality of U.S. Cellular\u2019s services or U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to roll out such future services in some markets, or could require that U.S. Cellular curtail existing services in order to make spectrum available for next-generation services. Spectrum constrained providers could be effectively capped in increasing market share. As spectrum constrained providers gain customers, they use up their network capacity. Since they lack spectrum, they can respond to demand only by adding cell sites, which is capital intensive, adds fixed operating costs, is limited by zoning considerations, and ultimately may not be cost effective.\nU.S. Cellular may acquire access to spectrum through a number of alternatives, including acquisitions, exchanges and participation in spectrum auctions. U.S. Cellular may participate in spectrum auctions conducted by the FCC in the future. As required by law, the FCC has conducted auctions for wireless spectrum licenses to use some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction and the determination of geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses, are made by the FCC pursuant to laws that it administers. The FCC may not be able to allocate spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain wireless spectrum licenses for new market entry or to expand their spectrum holdings to meet the expanding demand for data services or to address other spectrum constraints. Due to factors such as geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses and auction bidders that may raise prices beyond acceptable levels, U.S. Cellular may not be successful in FCC auctions in obtaining access to the spectrum that it believes is necessary to implement its business and technology strategies.\nIn addition, newly auctioned spectrum may not be compatible with existing spectrum, and vendors may not create suitable products to use such spectrum. Further, access to wireless spectrum licenses won in FCC auctions may not be available on a timely basis. Such access is dependent upon the FCC actually granting wireless spectrum licenses won, which can be delayed for various reasons. Furthermore, newly licensed spectrum may not be available for immediate use since the radio operations of incumbent users, including in some cases government agencies, may need to be relocated to other portions of the radio spectrum, and/or the newly licensed spectrum may be subject to sharing and coordination obligations. U.S. Cellular also may seek to acquire radio spectrum through purchases and exchanges with other spectrum licensees. However, U.S. Cellular may not be able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and U.S. Cellular may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.\n7)\nTo the extent conducted by the FCC, U.S. Cellular may participate in FCC auctions for additional spectrum or for funding in certain Universal Service programs in the future directly or indirectly and, during certain periods, will be subject to the FCC\u2019s anti-collusion rules, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular.\nFrom time to time, the FCC has conducted auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services, or through which universal service support funding is dispersed. U.S. Cellular has participated in such auctions in the past and may participate in other auctions conducted by the FCC in the future. FCC anti-collusion rules place certain restrictions on business communications and disclosures by participants in an FCC auction. These anti-collusion rules may restrict the normal conduct of U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, U.S. Cellular\u2019s acquisition, divestiture, exchange and other corporate development activity and/or disclosures by U.S. Cellular relating to an FCC auction. The restrictions could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n8)\nFailure by U.S. Cellular to timely or fully comply with any existing applicable legislative and/or regulatory requirements or changes thereto could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, state public utility commissions and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. Changes in the administration of the various regulatory agencies and legislative bodies could result in different policies with respect to many federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes to fiscal and tax policies, trade policies and tariffs on import goods. New or amended regulatory requirements could increase U.S. Cellular\u2019s costs and divert resources from other initiatives. Adverse decisions, increased regulation, or changes to existing regulation by regulatory bodies could negatively impact U.S. Cellular\u2019s operations by, among other things, permitting greater competition or limiting U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities, or retention and recruitment of skilled resources. New regulatory mandates or enforcement may require unexpected or increased capital expenditures, lost revenues, higher operating expenses or other changes. Court decisions and rulemakings could have a substantial impact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s operations, including rulemakings on broadband access to the internet, intercarrier access compensation and state and federal support funding. Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to respond to new regulations. Further, wireless spectrum licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC and could be revoked in the event of a violation of applicable laws or regulatory requirements. Also, although FCC rules relating to net neutrality have been repealed, some state legislators and regulators are seeking to or have already enacted state laws to reinstate net neutrality regulations and other rules. Interpretation and application of these rules, including conflicts between federal and state laws, may result in additional costs for compliance and may limit opportunities to derive profits from certain business practices or resources. For additional information related to U.S. Cellular\u2019s regulatory environment, see Risk Factor Number 15 below and \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.\nU.S. Cellular attempts to timely and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. However, U.S. Cellular is unable to predict the future actions of the various legislative and regulatory bodies that govern U.S. Cellular, but such actions could have adverse effects on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business. Any failure by U.S. Cellular to timely or fully comply with any regulatory requirements could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\n9)\nAn inability to attract people of outstanding talent throughout all levels of the organization, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business is highly technical and competition for skilled talent in the wireless industry is intense. Due to competition and/or limited supply for qualified management, technical, sales and other personnel, there can be no assurance that U.S. Cellular will be able to continue to attract and/or retain people of outstanding potential for the development of its business. The loss of the services of existing key personnel due to competition and/or retirements as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified personnel in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market for highly skilled leaders in the wireless industry also is extremely competitive. The future success of U.S. Cellular and its business depends in substantial part on U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly skilled leaders for all areas of its organization. The loss of any of U.S. Cellular\u2019s key leaders could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Effective succession planning is also important to U.S. Cellular\u2019s long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employees could also adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n10)\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s assets and revenue are concentrated in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry. Consequently, its operating results may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry.\nThe U.S. wireless telecommunications industry is facing significant change and an uncertain operating environment. U.S. Cellular\u2019s focus on the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry, together with its positioning relative to larger competitors with greater resources within the industry, may represent increased risk for investors due to the lack of diversification. This could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to attain and sustain long-term, profitable revenue growth and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n11)\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s smaller scale relative to larger competitors that may have greater financial and other resources than U.S. Cellular could cause U.S. Cellular to be unable to compete successfully, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere has been a trend in the telecommunications and related industries towards consolidation of service providers through acquisitions, reorganizations and joint ventures. This trend could continue, leading to larger competitors over time. U.S. Cellular has smaller scale efficiencies compared to larger competitors. U.S. Cellular may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources or that offer more services than U.S. Cellular, which could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues and costs of doing business. Specifically, U.S. Cellular\u2019s smaller scale relative to most of its competitors could have the following impacts, among others:\n\u25aa\nLow profit margins and returns on investment that are below U.S. Cellular\u2019s cost of capital;\n\u25aa\nIncreased operating costs due to lack of leverage with vendors;\n\u25aa\nInability to successfully deploy 5G or other wireless technologies, or to realize significant incremental revenues from their deployment;\n\u25aa\nLimited opportunities for strategic partnerships as potential partners are focused on wireless companies with greater scale and scope;\n\u25aa\nLimited access to content, as well as limited ability to obtain acceptably priced content;\n\u25aa\nLimited ability to influence industry standards;\n\u25aa\nReduced ability to invest in research and development of new services and products;\n\u25aa\nVendors may deem U.S. Cellular non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to U.S. Cellular, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies;\n\u25aa\nLimited access to intellectual property; and\n\u25aa\nOther limited opportunities such as for software development or third party distribution.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business increasingly depends on access to content for data and access to new wireless devices being developed by vendors. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to obtain such access depends in part on other parties. If U.S. Cellular is unable to obtain timely access to new content or wireless devices being developed by vendors, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the foregoing, U.S. Cellular\u2019s smaller scale relative to larger competitors could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n12)\nChanges in various business factors, including changes in demand, consumer preferences and perceptions, price competition, churn from customer switching activity and other factors, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in any of several factors could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aa\nDemand for or usage of services, particularly data services;\n\u25aa\nConsumer preferences, including type of wireless devices;\n\u25aa\nConsumer perceptions of network quality and performance;\n\u25aa\nConsumer expectations for self-service options through digital means;\n\u25aa\nThe pricing of services, including an increase in price-based competition;\n\u25aa\nThe overall size and growth rate of U.S. Cellular\u2019s customer base;\n\u25aa\nPenetration rates;\n\u25aa\nChurn rates;\n\u25aa\nSelling expenses;\n\u25aa\nNet customer acquisition and retention costs;\n\u25aa\nCustomers\u2019 ability to pay for wireless service and the potential impact on bad debts expense;\n\u25aa\nRoaming agreements and rates;\n\u25aa\nThird-party vendor support;\n\u25aa\nCapacity constraints;\n\u25aa\nThe mix of services and products offered by U.S. Cellular and purchased by customers; and\n\u25aa\nThe costs of providing services and products.\n13)\nAdvances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by U.S. Cellular obsolete, could put U.S. Cellular at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues or could increase its costs of doing business.\nThe telecommunications industry is experiencing significant changes in technologies and services expected by customers, as evidenced by evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new services and products, and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Widespread deployment of new technologies, including 5G and VoLTE technology, could cause the technology used on U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless networks and devices, including CDMA technology, to become less competitive or obsolete. Further, fixed-mobile convergence services that combine wireline broadband services with mobile services represent a competitive threat. If the trend toward convergence continues, U.S. Cellular is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence. Future technological changes or advancements may enable other wireless technologies to equal or exceed U.S. Cellular\u2019s current levels of service and render its system infrastructure obsolete. U.S. Cellular may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could reduce its revenues or increase its costs of doing business. If U.S. Cellular cannot keep pace with these technological changes or other changes in the telecommunications industry over time, its financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected.\n14)\nComplexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk and U.S. Cellular investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that U.S. Cellular expects.\nU.S. Cellular has completed the transition to 4G LTE and has implemented 4G LTE as well as VoLTE roaming agreements with national carriers. VoLTE technology is now available to nearly 70% of U.S. Cellular's subscribers, and deployments in additional operating markets are expected in 2020 and 2021. In addition, U.S. Cellular has begun to deploy 5G technology in its network and expects to launch commercial 5G services in selected markets in 2020. The deployment of 5G technology will require substantial investments in U.S. Cellular's wireless networks to remain competitive in the industry. Transition to 5G or other new technologies involves significant time, cost and risk, and anticipated products and revenues may not be realized. Furthermore, the wireless business experiences rapid technology changes and new services and products. If U.S. Cellular fails to effectively deploy new wireless technologies, services or products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, it is not certain that U.S. Cellular\u2019s investments in various new, unproven technologies and the related service and product offerings will be effective. The markets for some of these services, products and solutions may still be emerging and the overall potential for these markets, including revenues to be realized, may be uncertain. If customer demand for these new services, products and solutions does not develop as expected, U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n15)\nU.S. Cellular receives regulatory support and is subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments, and the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to great uncertainty, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTelecommunications companies may be designated by states, or in some cases by the FCC, as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) to receive universal service support payments if they provide specified services in \u201chigh cost\u201d areas. U.S. Cellular has been designated as an ETC in certain states and received $92 million in high cost support for service to high cost areas in 2019.\nIn 2011, the FCC released an order (USF Order) to: reform its universal service and intercarrier compensation mechanisms; establish a new, broadband-focused support mechanism; and propose further rules to advance reform. For a discussion of the USF Order and risks to such regulatory support, see \u201cRegulatory Matters - FCC Mobility Fund/5G Fund\u201d in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein. If the foregoing regulatory support is reduced from current levels, this could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results.\nTelecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees.\nThe division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with Federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and in the future may be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC in the future also may change the basis on which Federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of telecommunications services and products and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on telecommunications services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to U.S. Cellular\u2019s services is uncertain in many cases and jurisdictions may contest whether U.S. Cellular has assessed and remitted those monies correctly. Periodically, state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees U.S. Cellular currently pays. In some instances, U.S. Cellular passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on U.S. Cellular to customers. U.S. Cellular may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.\n16)\nChanges in U.S. Cellular\u2019s enterprise value, changes in the market supply or demand for wireless spectrum licenses, adverse developments in the business or the industry in which U.S. Cellular is involved and/or other factors could require U.S. Cellular to recognize impairments in the carrying value of its wireless spectrum licenses and/or physical assets.\nA large portion of U.S. Cellular\u2019s assets consists of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the form of wireless spectrum licenses. U.S. Cellular also has substantial investments in long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment. U.S. Cellular reviews its wireless spectrum licenses and other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss may need to be recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets. The amount of any such impairment loss could be significant and could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s reported financial results for the period in which the loss is recognized. The estimation of fair values requires assumptions by management about factors that are uncertain. Different assumptions for these factors could create materially different results.\n17)\nCosts, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or wireless spectrum licenses and/or expansion of U.S. Cellular\u2019s business could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of U.S. Cellular\u2019s operating strategy, U.S. Cellular from time to time may be engaged in the acquisition, divestiture or exchange of companies, businesses, strategic properties, wireless spectrum or other assets. U.S. Cellular may change the markets in which it operates and the services that it provides through such acquisitions, divestitures and/or exchanges. In general, U.S. Cellular may not disclose the negotiation of such transactions until a definitive agreement has been reached.\nThese transactions commonly involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25aa\nIdentification of attractive companies, businesses, properties, spectrum or other assets for acquisition or exchange, and/or the selection of U.S. Cellular\u2019s businesses or assets for divestiture or exchange;\n\u25aa\nCompetition for acquisition targets and the ability to acquire or exchange businesses at reasonable prices;\n\u25aa\nInability to make acquisitions that would achieve sufficient scale to be competitive with competitors with greater scale;\n\u25aa\nPossible lack of buyers for businesses or assets that U.S. Cellular desires to divest and the ability to divest or exchange such businesses or assets at reasonable prices;\n\u25aa\nAbility to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aa\nSignificant expenditures associated with acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aa\nRisks associated with integrating new businesses or markets, including risks relating to cybersecurity and privacy;\n\u25aa\nAbility to enter markets in which U.S. Cellular has limited or no direct prior experience and competitors have stronger positions;\n\u25aa\nAbility to integrate and manage businesses that are engaged in activities other than traditional wireless service;\n\u25aa\nUncertain revenues and expenses associated with acquisitions, with the result that U.S. Cellular may not realize the growth in revenues, anticipated cost structure, profitability, or return on investment that it expects;\n\u25aa\nDifficulty of integrating the technologies, services, products, operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, or of separating such matters for divested businesses or assets;\n\u25aa\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25aa\nDisruption of ongoing business;\n\u25aa\nImpact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s cash and available credit lines for use in financing future growth and working capital needs;\n\u25aa\nInability to retain key personnel;\n\u25aa\nInability to successfully incorporate acquired assets and rights into U.S. Cellular\u2019s service offerings;\n\u25aa\nInability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25aa\nPossible conditions to approval by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Department of Justice; and\n\u25aa\nImpairment of relationships with employees, customers or vendors.\nNo assurance can be given that U.S. Cellular will be successful with respect to its acquisition, divestiture or exchange strategies or initiatives. If U.S. Cellular is not successful with respect to its acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n18)\nA failure by U.S. Cellular to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network, support and other systems and infrastructure could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business plan includes significant construction activities and enhancements to its network, support and other systems and infrastructure. Additionally, the deployment of new wireless technologies, including 5G, may require substantial investments in U.S. Cellular's wireless network. As U.S. Cellular deploys, expands and enhances its network, it may need to acquire additional spectrum. Also, as U.S. Cellular continues to build out and enhance its network, U.S. Cellular must, among other things, continue to:\n\u25aa\nLease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to cell and switch sites;\n\u25aa\nObtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party approvals or permits for network construction;\n\u25aa\nComplete and update the radio frequency design, including cell site design, frequency planning and network optimization, for each of U.S. Cellular\u2019s markets; and\n\u25aa\nImprove, expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other financial and management systems.\nAny difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay implementation and deployment of new technologies, delay expansion of operations and product capabilities in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to successfully deploy new technologies, including 5G, and/or build-out and enhance U.S. Cellular\u2019s network, support facilities and other systems and infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies consumers' expectations for quality and coverage, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\n19)\nDifficulties involving third parties with which U.S. Cellular does business, including changes in U.S. Cellular's relationships with or financial or operational difficulties of key suppliers or independent agents and third party national retailers who market U.S. Cellular\u2019s services, could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular has relationships with independent agents and third party national retailers who market U.S. Cellular services. If such relationships are seriously harmed or if such parties experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nU.S. Cellular depends upon certain vendors to provide it with equipment (including wireless devices), services or content that meet its quality and cost requirements on a timely basis to continue its network construction and upgrades, and to operate its business. U.S. Cellular does not have operational or financial control over such key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. If these key suppliers (i) experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy or experience other operational difficulties or (ii) deem U.S. Cellular non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to U.S. Cellular, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies, they may not provide equipment, services or content to U.S. Cellular on a timely basis, or at all, or they may otherwise fail to honor their obligations to U.S. Cellular. Furthermore, consolidation among key suppliers may result in less competition and higher prices or the discontinuation of support for equipment owned by U.S. Cellular.\nOperation of U.S. Cellular\u2019s supply chain and management of its inventory require accurate forecasting of customer growth and demand, which has become increasingly challenging. If overall demand for wireless devices or the mix of demand for wireless devices is significantly different than U.S. Cellular\u2019s expectations, U.S. Cellular could face inadequate or excess supplies of particular models of wireless devices. This could result in lost sales opportunities or an excess supply of inventory. Further, U.S. Cellular's supply chain could be disrupted unexpectedly by raw material shortages, wars, natural disasters, disease or other factors. Any of these situations could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues, costs of doing business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlso, U.S. Cellular has other arrangements with third parties, including arrangements pursuant to which U.S. Cellular outsources certain support functions to third party vendors. Operational problems associated with such functions, including any failure by the vendor to provide the required level of service under the outsourcing arrangements, including possible cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security or privacy, could have adverse effects on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n20)\nU.S. Cellular has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular has significant investments in entities that it does not control, including equity investments and interests in certain variable interest entities. U.S. Cellular\u2019s interests in such entities do not provide U.S. Cellular with control over the business strategy, financial goals, network build-out plans or other operational aspects of these entities. U.S. Cellular cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of U.S. Cellular\u2019s investments, that U.S. Cellular\u2019s proportionate share of income from these investments will continue at the current level in the future or that U.S. Cellular will not incur losses from the holding of such investments. Losses in the values of such investments or a reduction in income from these investments could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain investments have historically contributed significant cash flows to U.S. Cellular and a reduction or suspension of such cash flows could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition.\n21)\nA failure by U.S. Cellular to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular relies extensively on its telecommunication networks and information technology to operate and manage its business, process transactions and summarize and report results. These networks and technology are subject to obsolescence and, consequently, must be upgraded, replaced and/or otherwise enhanced over time. Enhancements must be more flexible and dependable than ever before. All of this is capital intensive and challenging. A failure by U.S. Cellular to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe increased provision of data services has introduced significant new demands on U.S. Cellular\u2019s network and also has increased complexities related to network management. Further, the increased provision of data services on U.S. Cellular\u2019s networks has created an increased level of risk related to quality of service. This is due to the fact that many customers increasingly rely on data communications to execute and validate transactions. As a result, redundancy and geographical diversity of U.S. Cellular\u2019s network facilities are critical to providing uninterrupted service. Also, the speed of repair and maintenance procedures in the event of network interruptions is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to maintain high-quality, uninterrupted service to its customers is critical, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment and customers\u2019 ability to choose other service providers.\nIn addition, U.S. Cellular\u2019s networks and information technology and the networks and information technology of vendors on which U.S. Cellular relies are subject to damage or interruption due to various events, including power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, hackers and other cyber security risks, catastrophic events, natural disasters, errors or unauthorized actions by employees and vendors, flawed conversion of systems, disruptive technologies and technology changes.\n22)\nU.S. Cellular has experienced, and in the future expects to experience, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security of varying degrees on a regular basis, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular experiences cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. These include cyber-attacks intended to wrongfully obtain private and valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events, including denial of service attacks which may cause U.S. Cellular's services to be disrupted or unavailable to customers. U.S. Cellular maintains administrative, technical and physical controls, as well as other preventative actions, to reduce the risk of security breaches. Although to date U.S. Cellular has not discovered a material security breach, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material security breach stemming from future cyber-attacks. If U.S. Cellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 networks and information technology are not adequately adapted to changes in technology or are damaged or fail to function properly, and/or if U.S. Cellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 security is breached or otherwise compromised, U.S. Cellular could suffer adverse consequences, including theft, destruction or other loss of critical and private data, including customer and/or employee data, interruptions or delays in its operations, inaccurate billings, inaccurate financial reporting, and significant costs to remedy the problems. If U.S. Cellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach of customer or other data, U.S. Cellular may be required to expend significant resources and take various actions to address the problems, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, may be subject to fines, sanctions and litigation, and its reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. U.S. Cellular continues to experience denial of service attacks. Although U.S. Cellular has implemented and continues to enhance its protection and recovery measures in response to such attacks, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material denial of service attack in the future. Any material disruption in U.S. Cellular\u2019s networks or information technology, including security breaches, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n23)\nChanges in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require U.S. Cellular to record adjustments to amounts reflected in the financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires U.S. Cellular to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. U.S. Cellular bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require U.S. Cellular to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, if any, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n24)\nDisruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede U.S. Cellular\u2019s access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets, declines in consumer confidence, increases in unemployment, declines in economic growth, increased tariffs on import goods and uncertainty about corporate earnings could have a significant negative impact on the U.S. and global financial and credit markets and the overall economy. Such events could have an adverse impact on financial institutions resulting in limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Furthermore, economic uncertainties make it very difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Changes in economic conditions, changes in financial markets, changes in U.S. trade policies, deterioration in the capital markets or other factors could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n25)\nSettlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular is regularly involved in a number of legal and policy proceedings before the FCC and various state and federal courts. Such legal and policy proceedings can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel.\nThe assessment of legal and policy proceedings is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. Additionally, amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or resolution of litigation and other contingencies may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. Depending on a range of factors, these or similar proceedings could impose restraints on U.S. Cellular\u2019s current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\n26)\nThe possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from wireless devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices such as pacemakers, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMedia reports and certain professional studies have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless devices may be linked to various health problems, including cancer or tumors, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. U.S. Cellular is a party to and may in the future be a party to lawsuits against wireless carriers and other parties claiming damages for alleged health effects, including cancer or tumors, arising from wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless devices or expose U.S. Cellular to potential litigation. In addition, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt regulations in response to concerns about radio frequency emissions. Any resulting decrease in demand for wireless services, costs of litigation and damage awards or regulation could have an adverse effect on U. S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, some studies have indicated that some aspects of using a wireless device while driving may impair a driver's attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, any of which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n27)\nClaims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent U.S. Cellular from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject U.S. Cellular to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular faces possible effects of industry litigation relating to patents, other intellectual property or otherwise, that may restrict U.S. Cellular\u2019s access to devices or network equipment critical to providing services to customers. If technology that U.S. Cellular uses in products or services were determined by a court to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another person, U.S. Cellular could be precluded from using that technology and could be required to pay significant monetary damages. U.S. Cellular also may be required to pay significant royalties to such person to continue to use such technology in the future. The successful enforcement of any intellectual property rights, or U.S. Cellular\u2019s inability to negotiate a license for such rights on acceptable terms, could force U.S. Cellular to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that U.S. Cellular\u2019s products or services infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the effort and attention of U.S. Cellular\u2019s management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, U.S. Cellular cannot give assurance that it would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Although U.S. Cellular generally seeks to obtain indemnification agreements from vendors that provide it with technology, there can be no assurance that any claim of infringement will be covered by an indemnity or that U.S. Cellular will be able to recover all or any of its losses and costs under any available indemnity agreements. Any claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent U.S. Cellular from using necessary technology to provide its services or subject U.S. Cellular to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n28)\nThere are potential conflicts of interests between TDS and U.S. Cellular.\nTDS owns over 80% of the combined total of both classes of common stock of U.S. Cellular, including a majority of the outstanding Common Shares and 100% of the Series A Common Shares, and controls 96% of their combined voting power. As a result, TDS is effectively able to elect all of U.S. Cellular\u2019s eleven directors and otherwise control the management and operations of U.S. Cellular. Six of the eleven directors of U.S. Cellular are also directors of TDS and/or executive officers of TDS and/or U.S. Cellular. Directors and officers of TDS who are also directors or officers of U.S. Cellular, and TDS as U.S. Cellular\u2019s controlling shareholder, are in positions involving the possibility of conflicts of interest with respect to certain transactions concerning U.S. Cellular. When the interests of TDS and U.S. Cellular diverge, TDS may exercise its influence in its own best interests.\nU.S. Cellular and TDS have entered into contractual arrangements governing certain transactions and relationships between them. Some of these agreements were executed prior to the initial public offering of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares and were not the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the terms and conditions of these agreements are as favorable to U.S. Cellular as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nConflicts of interest may arise between TDS and U.S. Cellular when faced with decisions that could have different implications for U.S. Cellular and TDS, including technology decisions, financial decisions, the payment of distributions by U.S. Cellular, agreements or transactions between TDS and U.S. Cellular, business activities and other matters. TDS also may take action that favors its other businesses and the interests of its shareholders over U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless business and the interests of U.S. Cellular shareholders and debt holders. Because TDS controls U.S. Cellular, conflicts of interest could be resolved in a manner adverse to U.S. Cellular and its other shareholders or its debt holders.\nThe U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, so long as not less than 500,000 Series A Common Shares are outstanding, U.S. Cellular, without the written consent of TDS, shall not, directly or indirectly own, invest or otherwise have an interest in, lease, operate or manage any business other than a business engaged solely in the construction of, the ownership of interests in and/or the management of wireless telephone systems. This limitation on the scope of U.S. Cellular\u2019s potential business could hurt the growth of U.S. Cellular\u2019s business. This restriction would preclude U.S. Cellular from pursuing attractive related or unrelated business opportunities unless TDS consents in writing. TDS has no obligation to consent to any business opportunities proposed by U.S. Cellular and may withhold its consent in its own best interests.\n29)\nCertain matters, such as control by TDS and provisions in the U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of U.S. Cellular or have other consequences.\nThe control of U.S. Cellular by TDS may tend to deter non-negotiated tender offers or other efforts to obtain control of U.S. Cellular and thereby deprive shareholders of opportunities to sell shares at prices higher than those prevailing in the market.\nThe U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation also contains provisions which may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of U.S. Cellular without the support of TDS or without meeting various other conditions. In particular, the authorization of multiple classes of capital stock with different voting rights could prevent shareholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in control of U.S. Cellular by delaying or preventing such change in control.\nThe U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the U.S. Cellular Board of Directors to designate and issue Preferred Shares in one or more classes or series from time to time. Generally, no further action or authorization by the shareholders is necessary prior to the designation or issuance of the additional Preferred Shares authorized pursuant to the U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless applicable laws or regulations would require such approval in a given instance. Such Preferred Shares could be issued in circumstances that would serve to preserve TDS\u2019 control of U.S. Cellular.\nThe provisions of the U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the existence of different classes of capital stock and voting rights could result in the exclusion of U.S. Cellular Common Shares from certain major stock indices at some point in the future, unless U.S. Cellular is grandfathered by such stock indices or qualifies for some other exception.\n30)\nThe market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares is subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors.\nFactors that may affect the future market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares include:\n\u25aa\nGeneral economic conditions, including conditions in the credit and financial markets;\n\u25aa\nIndustry conditions;\n\u25aa\nFluctuations in U.S. Cellular\u2019s quarterly customer additions, churn rate, revenues, results of operations or cash flows;\n\u25aa\nVariations between U.S. Cellular\u2019s actual financial and operating results and those expected by analysts and investors; and\n\u25aa\nAnnouncements by U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors.\nAny of these or other factors could adversely affect the future market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares, or could cause the future market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares to fluctuate from time to time.\n31)\nAny of the foregoing events or other events could cause revenues, earnings, capital expenditures and/or any other financial or statistical information to vary from U.S. Cellular\u2019s forward-looking estimates by a material amount.\nFrom time to time, U.S. Cellular may disclose forward-looking information, including estimates of future operating revenues; various measures of income before income taxes; and/or capital expenditures. Any such forward-looking information includes consideration of known or anticipated changes to the extent disclosed, but dynamic market conditions and/or other unknown or unanticipated events, including but not limited to the risks discussed above, could cause such estimates to differ materially from the actual amounts.", "PERMNO": 75320, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "USM"}
