{"cik": "1567683", "company": "NRG Yield, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Proposed NRG Transaction\nThe Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the NRG Transaction.\nOn February 6, 2018, Global Infrastructure Partners, or GIP, entered into a purchase and sale agreement with NRG for the acquisition of NRG\u2019s full ownership interest in the Company and NRG\u2019s renewable energy development and operations platform. Also on February 6, 2018, the Company entered into a consent and indemnity agreement with NRG and GIP in connection with the purchase and sale agreement between NRG and GIP. The consent and indemnity agreement and the purchase and sale agreement are collectively referred to as the NRG Transaction. Consummation of the NRG Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of certain contractual consents and regulatory approvals from certain regulatory agencies, including approval by FERC and approvals from certain state regulatory agencies. While the parties have begun the process of notifying agencies and obtaining regulatory approvals and consents, there is no assurance that the parties will be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or consents to satisfy the closing conditions. Additionally, the NRG Transaction requires the Company\u2019s consent which is conditioned upon a number of items, all of which may not be met on a timely basis, or at all.\nIf the NRG Transaction is consummated, GIP may exercise substantial influence over the Company\u2019s policies and procedures and exercise substantial influence over the Company\u2019s Board, management and the types of third party acquisitions the Company makes. The Company may not identify future acquisitions or be able to secure financing on attractive terms or at all for future acquisitions and the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the financing support to be provided by GIP, which includes a $1.5 billion backstop credit facility to manage any change-of-control costs associated with the Company\u2019s corporate debt and up to $400 million in financing support for the Company\u2019s acquisition of the Carlsbad Energy Center. Further, GIP may not be able to maintain the Company\u2019s current relationships with customers, counterparties, suppliers, lenders and other third parties. Uncertainty about the effect of the NRG Transaction may negatively affect the Company\u2019s relationship with its counterparties and have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s business. The foregoing risks may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operational performance or limit the Company\u2019s growth prospects, including its ability to grow its dividend per share.\nFollowing the consummation of the NRG Transaction, GIP and its affiliates will control the Company and have the ability to designate a majority of the members of the Company\u2019s Board.\nThe governance agreements to be entered into among NRG, the Company, GIP and its affiliates in connection with the NRG Transaction provide GIP the ability to designate a majority of the Company\u2019s Board to the Company\u2019s Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee for nomination for election by the Company\u2019s stockholders and also require that the Company and GIP use their commercially reasonable efforts to submit to the Company\u2019s stockholders at the Company\u2019s 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders a charter amendment to classify the Company\u2019s Board into two classes (with the independent directors and directors designated by GIP allocated across the two classes). Due to such agreements and GIP's approximate 55.1% combined voting power in the Company following the completion of the NRG Transaction, the ability of other holders of the Company\u2019s Class A and Class C common stock to exercise control over the corporate governance of the Company will be limited. In addition, due to its approximate 55.1% combined voting power in the Company following the completion of the NRG Transaction, GIP and its affiliates will have a substantial influence on the Company\u2019s affairs and its voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of the Company\u2019s stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders, including the classification of the Board of Directors. GIP may hold certain interests that are different from those of the Company or other holders of the Company\u2019s Class A and Class C common stock and there is no assurance that GIP will exercise its control over the Company in a manner that is consistent with the Company\u2019s interests or those of the holders of the Company\u2019s Class A and Class C common stock.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nCertain facilities are newly constructed and may not perform as expected.\nCertain of the Company's conventional and renewable assets are newly constructed. The ability of these facilities to meet the Company's performance expectations is subject to the risks inherent in newly constructed power generation facilities and the construction of such facilities, including, but not limited to, degradation of equipment in excess of the Company's expectations, system failures, and outages. The failure of these facilities to perform as the Company expects could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and its ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company's common stock.\nPursuant to the Company's cash dividend policy, the Company intends to distribute a significant amount of the CAFD through regular quarterly distributions and dividends, and the Company's ability to grow and make acquisitions through cash on hand could be limited.\nThe Company expects to distribute a significant amount of the CAFD each quarter and to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities and, if applicable, borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. The Company may be precluded from pursuing otherwise attractive acquisitions if the projected short-term cash flow from the acquisition or investment is not adequate to service the capital raised to fund the acquisition or investment, after giving effect to the Company's available cash reserves. To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities in connection with any acquisitions or growth capital expenditures, the payment of dividends on these additional equity securities may increase the risk that the Company will be unable to maintain or increase its per share dividend. The incurrence of bank borrowings or other debt by NRG Yield Operating LLC or by the Company's project-level subsidiaries to finance the Company\u2019s growth strategy will result in increased interest expense and the imposition of additional or more restrictive covenants, which, in turn, may impact the cash distributions the Company receives to distribute to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may not be able to effectively identify or consummate any future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe Company's business strategy includes growth through the acquisitions of additional generation assets (including through corporate acquisitions). This strategy depends on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities and consummate acquisitions on favorable terms. However, the number of acquisition opportunities is limited. In addition, the Company will compete with other companies for these limited acquisition opportunities, which may increase the Company\u2019s cost of making acquisitions or cause the Company to refrain from making acquisitions at all. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors for acquisitions are much larger than the Company with substantially greater resources. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than the Company\u2019s financial or human resources permit. If the Company is unable to identify and consummate future acquisitions, it will impede the Company\u2019s ability to execute its growth strategy and limit the Company\u2019s ability to increase the amount of dividends paid to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s ability to acquire future renewable facilities may depend on the viability of renewable assets generally. These assets currently are largely contingent on public policy mechanisms including ITCs, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation, RPS and carbon trading plans. These mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of the Company\u2019s growth strategy and expansion into clean energy investments.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to effectively consummate future acquisitions will also depend on the Company\u2019s ability to arrange the required or desired financing for acquisitions.\nThe Company may not have sufficient availability under the Company\u2019s credit facilities or have access to project-level financing on commercially reasonable terms when acquisition opportunities arise. An inability to obtain the required or desired financing could significantly limit the Company\u2019s ability to consummate future acquisitions and effectuate the Company\u2019s growth strategy. If financing is available, utilization of the Company\u2019s credit facilities or project-level financing for all or a portion of the purchase price of an acquisition could significantly increase the Company\u2019s interest expense, impose additional or more restrictive covenants and reduce CAFD. Similarly, the issuance of additional equity securities as consideration for acquisitions could cause significant stockholder dilution and reduce the Company\u2019s dividends if the acquisitions are not sufficiently accretive. The Company\u2019s ability to consummate future acquisitions may also depend on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals for such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, approval by FERC under Section 203 of the FPA.\nFinally, the acquisition of companies and assets are subject to substantial risks, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence (for which the Company may not be indemnified post-closing), the risk of over-paying for assets (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis) and the ability to retain customers. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company's acquisitions may divert management\u2019s attention from the Company's existing business concerns, disrupt the Company's ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. As a result, the consummation of acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nEven if the Company consummates acquisitions that it believes will be accretive to CAFD per share of Class A common stock and Class C common stock, those acquisitions may decrease the CAFD per share of Class A common stock and Class C common stock as a result of incorrect assumptions in the Company\u2019s evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe acquisition of existing generation assets involves the risk of overpaying for such projects (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis) and failing to retain the customers of such projects. While the Company will perform due diligence on prospective acquisitions, the Company may not discover all potential risks, operational issues or other issues in such generation assets. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions require substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company\u2019s acquisitions may divert the Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention from its existing business concerns, disrupt its ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. Future acquisitions might not perform as expected or the returns from such acquisitions might not support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. A failure to achieve the financial returns the Company expects when it acquires generation assets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its Class A and Class C stockholders. Any failure of the Company\u2019s acquired generation assets to be accretive or difficulty in integrating such acquisition into the Company\u2019s business could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its Class A and Class C stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital to fund the Company\u2019s operations or pay dividends. It could also expose the Company to the risk of increased interest rates and limit the Company\u2019s ability to react to changes in the economy or the Company\u2019s industry as well as impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $5,897 million of total consolidated indebtedness, $4,376 million of which was incurred by the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\u2019s share of its unconsolidated affiliates\u2019 total indebtedness and letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2017, totaled approximately $777 million and $98 million, respectively (calculated as the Company\u2019s unconsolidated affiliates\u2019 total indebtedness as of such date multiplied by the Company\u2019s percentage membership interest in such assets).\nThe Company\u2019s substantial debt could have important negative consequences on the Company\u2019s financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the Company\u2019s indebtedness, therefore reducing the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s capital stock (including the Class A and Class C common stock) or to use the Company\u2019s cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestricting the Company\u2019s ability to make certain distributions with respect to the Company\u2019s capital stock (including the Class A and Class C common stock) and the ability of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to make certain distributions to it, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in the Company\u2019s credit facilities and other financing agreements;\n\u2022\nexposing the Company to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of the Company\u2019s borrowings, which may include borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to the Company\u2019s competitors who have less debt.\nThe Company's revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the Company\u2019s ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in the Company\u2019s long-term best interests. The Company\u2019s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants could prevent the Company from paying cash dividends, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s project-level financing contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the Company\u2019s project subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to the Company or otherwise engage in activities that may be in the Company\u2019s long-term best interests. The project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities to the Company unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of certain financial ratios. The Company\u2019s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants may prevent cash distributions by the particular project(s) to it and, the Company\u2019s failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness. If the Company is unable to make distributions from the Company\u2019s project-level subsidiaries, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nLetter of credit facilities to support project-level contractual obligations generally need to be renewed after five to seven years, at which time the Company will need to satisfy applicable financial ratios and covenants. If the Company is unable to renew the Company\u2019s letters of credit as expected or replace them with letters of credit under different facilities on favorable terms or at all, the Company may experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, such inability may constitute a default under certain project-level financing arrangements, restrict the ability of the project-level subsidiary to make distributions to it and/or reduce the amount of cash available at such subsidiary to make distributions to the Company.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions;\n\u2022\ncredit availability from banks and other financial institutions;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in the Company, its partners, NRG, as the Company\u2019s principal stockholder (on a combined voting basis) and manager under the Management Services Agreement, or GIP, as successor to NRG's interests in the Company if the NRG Transaction is consummated, and the regional wholesale power markets;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s financial performance and the financial performance of the Company subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of acceptable project credit ratings or credit quality;\n\u2022\ncash flow; and\n\u2022\nprovisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\nThe Company may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. Furthermore, the Company may be unable to refinance or replace project-level financing arrangements or other credit facilities on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. The Company's failure, or the failure of any of the Company\u2019s projects, to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of the Company's long-term bilateral contracts result from state-mandated procurements and could be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nA significant portion of the Company's revenues are derived from long-term bilateral contracts with utilities that are regulated by their respective states, and have been entered into pursuant to certain state programs. Certain long-term contracts that other companies have with state-regulated utilities have been challenged in federal court and have been declared unconstitutional on the grounds that the rate for energy and capacity established by the contracts impermissibly conflicts with the rate for energy and capacity established by FERC pursuant to the FPA. If certain of the Company's state-mandated agreements with utilities are ever held to be invalid, the Company may be unable to replace such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe generation of electric energy from solar and wind energy sources depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions.\nIf solar or wind conditions are unfavorable, the Company's electricity generation and revenue from renewable generation facilities may be substantially below the Company's expectations. The electricity produced and revenues generated by a solar or wind energy generation facility is highly dependent on suitable solar or wind conditions, as applicable, and associated weather conditions, which are beyond the Company's control. Furthermore, components of the Company's systems, such as solar panels and inverters, could be damaged by severe weather, such as hailstorms or tornadoes. In addition, replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable. Unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions could impair the effectiveness of the Company's assets or reduce their output beneath their rated capacity or require shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of the Company's renewable assets. In addition, climate change may have the long-term effect of changing wind patterns at our projects. Changing wind patterns could cause changes in expected electricity generation. These events could also degrade equipment or components and the interconnection and transmission facilities\u2019 lives or maintenance costs.\nAlthough the Company bases its investment decisions with respect to each renewable generation facility on the findings of related wind and solar studies conducted on-site prior to construction or based on historical conditions at existing facilities, actual climatic conditions at a facility site, particularly wind conditions, may not conform to the findings of these studies and may be affected by variations in weather patterns, including any potential impact of climate change. Therefore, the Company's solar and wind energy facilities may not meet anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of the Company's generation assets, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperation of electric generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing operation of the Company's facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among other things. Operation of the Company's facilities also involves risks that the Company will be unable to transport its products to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the business. Unplanned outages typically increase operation and maintenance expenses, capital expenditures and may reduce revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or require the Company to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward power sales obligations. The Company's inability to operate its electric generation assets efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow from the Company's asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the Company maintains insurance, obtains warranties from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover the Company's lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should it experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems.\nIn addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company's operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in the Company being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. The Company maintains an amount of insurance protection that it considers adequate but cannot provide any assurance that the Company's insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject. Furthermore, the Company's insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss for which the Company is not fully insured (which may include a significant judgment against any facility or facility operator) could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of electric generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output.\nThe Company's facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, could reduce the Company's facilities' generating capacity below expected levels, reducing the Company's revenues and jeopardizing the Company's ability to pay dividends to holders of its common stock at expected levels or at all. Degradation of the performance of the Company's solar facilities above levels provided for in the related offtake agreements may also reduce the Company's revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing the Company's facilities may also reduce profitability.\nIf the Company makes any major modifications to its conventional power generation facilities, it may be required to install the best available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source review provisions of the CAA in the future. Any such modifications could likely result in substantial additional capital expenditures. The Company may also choose to repower, refurbish or upgrade its facilities based on its assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such facilities require time for development and capital expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel and power prices. These events could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCounterparties to the Company's offtake agreements may not fulfill their obligations and, as the contracts expire, the Company may not be able to replace them with agreements on similar terms in light of increasing competition in the markets in which the Company operates.\nA significant portion of the electric power the Company generates is sold under long-term offtake agreements with public utilities or industrial or commercial end-users, with a weighted average remaining duration of approximately 15 years based on CAFD. As of December 31, 2017, the largest customers of the Company's power generation assets, including assets in which the Company has less than a 100% membership interest, were SCE and PG&E, which represented 40% and 23%, respectively, of the net electric generation capacity of the Company's facilities.\nIf, for any reason, any of the purchasers of power under these agreements are unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations or if they refuse to accept delivery of power delivered thereunder or if they otherwise terminate such agreements prior to the expiration thereof, the Company's assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, to the extent any of the Company's power purchasers are, or are controlled by, governmental entities, the Company's facilities may be subject to legislative or other political action that may impair their contractual performance.\nThe power generation industry is characterized by intense competition and the Company's electric generation assets encounter competition from utilities, industrial companies and other independent power producers, in particular with respect to uncontracted output. In recent years, there has been increasing competition among generators for offtake agreements and this has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets characterized by excess supply above designated reserve margins. In light of these market conditions, the Company may not be able to replace an expiring or terminated agreement with an agreement on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. In addition, the Company believes many of its competitors have well-established relationships with the Company's current and potential suppliers, lenders and customers, and have extensive knowledge of its target markets. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements than the Company will be able to. Adoption of technology more advanced than the Company's could reduce its competitors' power production costs resulting in their having a lower cost structure than is achievable with the technologies currently employed by the Company and adversely affect its ability to compete for offtake agreement renewals. If the Company is unable to replace an expiring or terminated offtake agreement, the affected facility may temporarily or permanently cease operations. External events, such as a severe economic downturn, could also impair the ability of some counterparties to the Company's offtake agreements and other customer agreements to pay for energy and/or other products and services received.\nThe Company's inability to enter into new or replacement offtake agreements or to compete successfully against current and future competitors in the markets in which the Company operates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s facilities may operate, wholly or partially, without long-term power sales agreements.\nThe Company\u2019s facilities may operate without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore be exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements for the facilities, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by the facilities at commercially attractive rates or that the facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to less predictable revenues, future impairments of the Company's property, plant and equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities, resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nA portion of the steam and chilled water produced by the Company's thermal assets is sold at regulated rates, and the revenue earned by the Company's GenConn assets is established each year in a rate case; accordingly, the profitability of these assets is dependent on regulatory approval.\nApproximately 378 net MWt of capacity from certain of the Company's thermal assets are sold at rates approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission for the thermal assets. Similarly, the revenues related to approximately 380 MW of capacity from the GenConn assets are established each year by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. While such regulatory oversight is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that the Company may charge, or the revenue that the Company may earn with respect to this capacity are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. There can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of the costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates or revenues are determined will always result in rates or revenues that achieve full recovery of costs or an adequate return on the Company's capital investments. While the Company's rates and revenues are generally established based on an analysis of costs incurred in a base year, the rates the Company is allowed to charge, and the revenues the Company is authorized to earn, may or may not match the costs at any given time. If the Company's costs are not adequately recovered through these regulatory processes, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSupplier and/or customer concentration at certain of the Company's facilities may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.\nThe Company often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel, equipment, technology and/or other services required for the operation of certain facilities. In addition, certain of the Company's suppliers provide long-term warranties with respect to the performance of their products or services. If any of these suppliers cannot perform under their agreements with the Company, or satisfy their related warranty obligations, the Company will need to utilize the marketplace to provide or repair these products and services. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these products and services as, when and where required. The Company may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on favorable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to enter into replacement agreements to provide for fuel, equipment, technology and other required services, it would seek to purchase the related goods or services at market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price. The Company may also be required to make significant capital contributions to remove, replace or redesign equipment that cannot be supported or maintained by replacement suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, credit support terms and cash flows.\nIn addition, potential or existing customers at the Company\u2019s district energy centers and combined heat and power plants, or the Energy Centers, may opt for on-site systems in lieu of using the Company\u2019s Energy Centers, either due to corporate policies regarding the allocation of capital, unique situations where an on-site system might in fact prove more efficient, because of previously committed capital in systems that are already on-site, or otherwise. At times, the Company relies on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility.\nThe failure of any supplier to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Company or the Company\u2019s loss of potential or existing customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, the Company's suppliers and vendors and the Company\u2019s ability to solicit and retain customers.\nThe Company currently owns, and in the future may acquire, certain assets in which the Company has limited control over management decisions and its interests in such assets may be subject to transfer or other related restrictions.\nAs described in Item 15 - Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities, the Company has limited control over the operation of certain of its assets, because the Company beneficially owns less than a majority of the membership interests in such assets. The Company may seek to acquire additional assets in which it owns less than a majority of the related membership interests in the future. In these investments, the Company will seek to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of assets in which it owns less than a majority of the membership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. The Company may be dependent on its co-venturers to operate such assets. The Company's co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these assets optimally. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between the Company and its stockholders, on the one hand, and the Company's co-venturers, on the other hand, where the Company's co-venturers' business interests are inconsistent with the interests of the Company and its stockholders. Further, disagreements or disputes between the Company and its co-venturers could result in litigation, which could increase expenses and potentially limit the time and effort the Company's officers and directors are able to devote to the business.\nThe approval of co-venturers may also be required for the Company to receive distributions of funds from assets or to sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise convey its interest in such assets, or for the Company to acquire NRG's interests in such co-ventures as an initial matter. Alternatively, the Company's co-venturers may have rights of first refusal or rights of first offer in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of the Company's interests in such assets. These restrictions may limit the price or interest level for interests in such assets, in the event the Company wants to sell such interests.\nFurthermore, certain of the Company's facilities are operated by third-party operators, such as First Solar. To the extent that third-party operators do not fulfill their obligations to manage operations of the facilities or are not effective in doing so, the amount of CAFD may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's assets are exposed to risks inherent in the use of interest rate swaps and forward fuel purchase contracts and the Company may be exposed to additional risks in the future if it utilizes other derivative instruments.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. In addition, the Company uses forward fuel purchase contracts to hedge its limited commodity exposure with respect to the Company's district energy assets. If the Company elects to enter into such commodity hedges, the related asset could recognize financial losses on these arrangements as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. If actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources are not available, the valuation of these contracts would involve judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. If the values of these financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's business is subject to restrictions resulting from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, the Company may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property where there has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether the Company knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed an affected property's value, the Company could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws provide for the creation of a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government as security for damages and any costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination and associated clean-up. Although the Company generally requires its operators to undertake to indemnify it for environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the operator to indemnify the Company. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the Company's ability to operate the business.\nThe Company does not own all of the land on which its power generation or thermal assets are located, which could result in disruption to its operations.\nThe Company does not own all of the land on which its power generation or thermal assets are located and the Company is, therefore, subject to the possibility of less desirable terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid leases or rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Although the Company has obtained rights to construct and operate these assets pursuant to related lease arrangements, the rights to conduct those activities are subject to certain exceptions,\nincluding the term of the lease arrangement. The Company is also at risk of condemnation on land it owns. The loss of these rights, through the Company's inability to renew right-of-way contracts, condemnation or otherwise, may adversely affect the Company's ability to operate its generation and thermal infrastructure assets.\nThe Company\u2019s use and enjoyment of real property rights for its projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to the Company.\nSolar and wind projects generally are, and are likely to be, located on land occupied by the project pursuant to long-term easements and leases. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to the project\u2019s easements and leases. As a result, the project\u2019s rights under these easements or leases may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. The Company performs title searches and obtains title insurance to protect itself against these risks. Such measures may, however, be inadequate to protect the Company against all risk of loss of its rights to use the land on which the wind projects are located, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe electric generation business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in laws or regulations, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or other legal requirements.\nThe Company's electric generation business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability. Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services. Except for generating facilities within the footprint of ERCOT which are regulated by the PUCT, all of the Company\u2019s assets make wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services in interstate commerce and are public utilities for purposes of the FPA, unless otherwise exempt from such status. FERC's orders that grant market-based rate authority to wholesale power marketers reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if FERC subsequently determines that the seller can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, public utilities are subject to FERC reporting requirements that impose administrative burdens and that, if violated, can expose the company to criminal and civil penalties or other risks.\nThe Company's market-based sales will be subject to certain rules prohibiting manipulative or deceptive conduct, and if any of the Company's generating companies are deemed to have violated those rules, they will be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation, penalties, suspension or revocation of market based rate authority. If such generating companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain FERC's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the significant accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates the Company is able to charge for power from its facilities.\nMost of the Company's assets are operating as EWGs as defined under the PUHCA, or QFs as defined under the PURPA, as amended, and therefore are exempt from certain regulation under the PUHCA and the PURPA. If a facility fails to maintain its status as an EWG or a QF or there are legislative or regulatory changes revoking or limiting the exemptions to the PUHCA, then the Company may be subject to significant accounting, record-keeping, access to books and records and reporting requirements and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the imposition of penalties and additional compliance obligations.\nSubstantially all of the Company's generation assets are also subject to the reliability standards promulgated by the designated Electric Reliability Organization (currently the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC) and approved by FERC. If the Company fails to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties and increased compliance obligations. The Company will also be affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing regional markets operated by RTOs or ISOs, such as PJM. The RTOs/ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps, non-performance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the Company's generation facilities acquired in the future that sell energy, capacity and ancillary products into the wholesale power markets. The regulatory environment for electric generation has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting wholesale competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases, transmission assets. These changes are ongoing and the Company cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the\nCompany's business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed to re-regulate the markets or require divestiture of electric generation assets by asset owners or operators to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, the Company's business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on its operations, as well as potentially substantial liabilities arising out of environmental contamination.\nThe Company's assets are subject to numerous and significant federal, state and local laws, including statutes, regulations, guidelines, policies, directives and other requirements governing or relating to, among other things: protection of wildlife, including threatened and endangered species; air emissions; discharges into water; water use; the storage, handling, use, transportation and distribution of dangerous goods and hazardous, residual and other regulated materials, such as chemicals; the prevention of releases of hazardous materials into the environment; the prevention, presence and remediation of hazardous materials in soil and groundwater, both on and offsite; land use and zoning matters; and workers' health and safety matters. The Company's facilities could experience incidents, malfunctions and other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions in excess of permitted levels and result in personal injury, penalties and property damage. As such, the operation of the Company's facilities carries an inherent risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities (including potential civil actions, compliance or remediation orders, fines and other penalties), and may result in the assets being involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters. The Company has implemented environmental, health and safety management programs designed to continually improve environmental, health and safety performance. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time. Significant costs may be incurred for capital expenditures under environmental programs to keep the assets compliant with such environmental laws and regulations. If it is not economical to make those expenditures, it may be necessary to retire or mothball facilities or restrict or modify the Company's operations to comply with more stringent standards. These environmental requirements and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks that are beyond the Company's control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's generation facilities that were acquired or those that the Company otherwise acquires or constructs and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than other domestic targets. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the related distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as create significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage.\nFurthermore, certain of the Company's power generation thermal assets are located in active earthquake zones in California and Arizona, and certain project companies and suppliers conduct their operations in the same region or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters. In addition, California and some of the locations where certain suppliers are located, from time to time, have experienced shortages of water, electric power and natural gas. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, drought, flood or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting the Company or its suppliers, could cause a significant interruption in the business, damage or destroy the Company's facilities or those of its suppliers or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of the Company's suppliers. Any such terrorist acts, environmental repercussions or disruptions or natural disasters could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe operation of the Company\u2019s businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk.\nNumerous functions affecting the efficient operation of the Company\u2019s businesses depend on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. The operation of the Company's generating assets rely on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information could be lost or stolen, causing the Company to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and\ndamage to the Company's reputation. In addition, the Company may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its cyber systems and generating assets.\nGovernment regulations providing incentives for renewable generation could change at any time and such changes may negatively impact the Company's growth strategy.\nThe Company's growth strategy depends in part on government policies that support renewable generation and enhance the economic viability of owning renewable electric generation assets. Renewable generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives such as ITCs, cash grants in lieu of ITCs, loan guarantees, RPS, programs, modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation and bonus depreciation. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects that began construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC. Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively. The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects that began construction in years 2016 through 2019. Wind projects that begin construction in the years 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively.\nMany states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy. However, the regulations that govern the RPS programs, including pricing incentives for renewable energy, or reasonableness guidelines for pricing that increase valuation compared to conventional power (such as a projected value for carbon reduction or consideration of avoided integration costs), may change. If the RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future growth prospects. Such material adverse effects may result from decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing. Furthermore, the ARRA included incentives to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector, such as cash grants in lieu of ITCs, bonus depreciation and expansion of the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program. It is uncertain what loan guarantees may be made by the U.S. DOE loan guarantee program in the future. In addition, the cash grant in lieu of ITCs program only applies to facilities that commenced construction prior to December 31, 2011, which commencement date may be determined in accordance with the safe harbor if more than 5% of the total cost of the eligible property was paid or incurred by December 31, 2011.\nIf the Company is unable to utilize various federal, state and local government incentives to acquire additional renewable assets in the future, or the terms of such incentives are revised in a manner that is less favorable to the Company, it may suffer a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company relies on electric interconnection and transmission facilities that it does not own or control and that are subject to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's regions. If these facilities fail to provide the Company with adequate transmission capacity, it may be restricted in its ability to deliver electric power to its customers and may either incur additional costs or forego revenues.\nThe Company depends on electric interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the wholesale power it will sell from its electric generation assets to its customers. A failure or delay in the operation or development of these interconnection or transmission facilities or a significant increase in the cost of the development of such facilities could result in lost revenues. Such failures or delays could limit the amount of power the Company's operating facilities deliver or delay the completion of the Company's construction projects. Additionally, such failures, delays or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. If a region's power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, the Company's recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have a sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. The Company also cannot predict whether interconnection and transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets. In addition, certain of the Company's operating facilities' generation of electricity may be curtailed without compensation due to transmission limitations or limitations on the electricity grid's ability to accommodate intermittent electricity generating sources, reducing the Company's revenues and impairing its ability to capitalize fully on a particular facility's generating potential. Such curtailments could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, economic congestion on transmission networks in certain of the markets in which the Company operates may occur and the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs. If the Company were liable for such congestion costs, its financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the disruption of the fuel supplies necessary to generate power at its conventional and thermal power generation facilities.\nDelivery of fossil fuels to fuel the Company's conventional and thermal generation facilities is dependent upon the infrastructure (including natural gas pipelines) available to serve each such generation facility as well as upon the continuing financial viability of contractual counterparties. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at these generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.\nThe Company depends on key management employees, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company believes its current operations and future success depend largely on the continued services of the management employees that it employs, in particular Christopher Sotos, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Chad Plotkin, the Company\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Although the Company currently has access to the resources of NRG, the loss of Mr. Sotos\u2019 or Mr. Plotkin\u2019s services, or other key management personnel employed by the Company in connection with the NRG Transaction or in the future, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company's Relationship with NRG\nNRG is the Company's controlling stockholder and exercises substantial influence over the Company. The Company is highly dependent on NRG.\nNRG owns all of the Company's outstanding Class B and Class D common stock. The Company's outstanding Class B and Class D common stock is entitled to one vote per share and 1/100th of a vote per share, respectively. As a result of its ownership of the Class B and Class D common stock, NRG owns 55.1% of the combined voting power of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2017. As a result of this ownership, NRG has a substantial influence on the Company's affairs and its voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of the Company's stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of the Company's stockholders. Such matters include the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to the Company's restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws and approval of mergers or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or discouraging others from making tender offers for the Company's shares. In addition, NRG has the right to elect all of the Company's directors. NRG may cause corporate actions to be taken even if their interests conflict with the interests of the Company's other stockholders (including holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock). If the NRG Transaction is consummated, GIP will become the Company\u2019s controlling stockholder and, like NRG, will have substantial control and influence over the Company. See the risk factor entitled \u201cFollowing the consummation of the NRG Transaction, GIP and its affiliates will control the Company and have the ability to designate a majority of the members of the Company\u2019s Board.\u201d\nFurthermore, the Company depends on the management and administration services provided by or under the direction of NRG under the Management Services Agreement. NRG personnel and support staff that provide services to the Company under the Management Services Agreement are not required to, and the Company does not expect that they will, have as their primary responsibility the management and administration of the Company or to act exclusively for the Company and the Management Services Agreement does not require any specific individuals to be provided by NRG. Under the Management Services Agreement, NRG has the discretion to determine which of its employees perform assignments required to be provided to the Company. Any failure to effectively manage the Company's operations or to implement its strategy could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Management Services Agreement will continue in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe Company also depends upon NRG for the provision of management, administration and certain other services at all of the Company's facilities and contracts with NRG, or its subsidiaries, to procure fuel and sell power for certain of its operating facilities. Any failure by NRG to perform its requirements under these arrangements or the failure by the Company to identify and contract with replacement service providers, if required, could adversely affect the operation of the Company's facilities and have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the proposed NRG Transaction, GIP has agreed to enter into certain agreements with the Company relating to the provision of services and NRG has agreed to enter into certain agreements with the Company relating to transition services and ongoing commercial arrangements. While the provision of transitional services is contemplated under the proposed NRG Transaction, it is uncertain whether, after the transition services end, GIP or its affiliates would continue to provide the same services, or offer the same capabilities and resources, to the Company that the Company currently receives from NRG or whether the Company may have to seek alternative service providers. The Company may not be able to replicate the same level of services, capabilities, experience and familiarity with the Company\u2019s business offered by NRG either through GIP or through alternative service providers or on terms or costs similar to those provided by NRG. The loss of services provided by NRG and the benefits offered to the Company through its relationship with NRG, such as management, operational and financing expertise, could have an impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also the risk factor entitled \u201cIf NRG terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, or if the transition services to be provided by NRG to the Company in connection with the consummation of the NRG Transaction are inadequate or end, the Company may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all.\u201d\nThe Company may not be able to consummate future acquisitions from NRG.\nUntil the NRG Transaction is consummated, if at all, the Company's ability to grow through acquisitions depends, in part, on NRG's ability to identify and present the Company with acquisition opportunities. NRG established the Company to hold and acquire a diversified suite of power generating assets in the U.S. and its territories. Although NRG has agreed to grant the Company a right of first offer with respect to certain power generation assets that NRG may elect to sell in the future, NRG is under no obligation to sell any such power generation assets or to accept any related offer from the Company. In addition, NRG has not agreed to commit any minimum level of dedicated resources for the pursuit of renewable power-related acquisitions. There are a number of factors which could materially and adversely impact the extent to which suitable acquisition opportunities are made available from NRG, including:\n\u2022\nthe same professionals within NRG's organization that are involved in acquisitions that are suitable for the Company have responsibilities within NRG's broader asset management business, which may include sourcing acquisition opportunities for NRG. Limits on the availability of such individuals will likewise result in a limitation on the availability of acquisition opportunities for the Company; and\n\u2022\nin addition to structural limitations, the question of whether a particular asset is suitable is highly subjective and is dependent on a number of factors including an assessment by NRG relating to the Company's liquidity position at the time, the risk profile of the opportunity and its fit with the balance of the Company's then current operations and other factors. If NRG determines that an opportunity is not suitable for the Company, it may still pursue such opportunity on its own behalf, or on behalf of another NRG affiliate.\nIn making these determinations, NRG may be influenced by factors that result in a misalignment with the Company's interests or conflict of interest.\nThe departure of some or all of NRG's employees could prevent the Company from achieving its objectives.\nThe Company depends on the diligence, skill and business contacts of NRG's professionals and the information and opportunities they generate during the normal course of their activities. Furthermore, approximately 24% of NRG's employees at the Company's generation plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2017. The Company's future success will depend on the continued service of these individuals, who are not obligated to remain employed with NRG, or otherwise successfully renegotiate their collective bargaining agreements when such agreements expire or otherwise terminate. NRG has experienced departures of key professionals and personnel in the past and may do so if the NRG Transaction is consummated, and the Company cannot predict the impact that any such departures will have on its ability to achieve its objectives. The Management Services Agreement does not require NRG to maintain the employment of any of its professionals or to cause any particular professional to provide services to the Company or on its behalf. The departure of a significant number of NRG's professionals or a material portion of the NRG employees who work at any of the Company's facilities for any reason, or the failure to appoint qualified or effective successors in the event of such departures, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to achieve its objectives.\nThe Company's organizational and ownership structure may create significant conflicts of interest that may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interests of the Company or the best interests of holders of its Class A and Class C common stock and that may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between the Company and holders of its Class A and Class C common stock, on the one hand, and NRG, on the other hand. Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement with NRG, certain of the Company's executive officers are shared NRG executives and devote their time to both the Company and NRG as needed to conduct the respective businesses. Although the Company's directors and executive officers owe fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders, these shared NRG executives have fiduciary and other duties to NRG, which duties may be inconsistent with the Company's best interests and holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock. In addition, NRG and its representatives, agents and affiliates have access to the Company's confidential information. Although some of these persons are subject to confidentiality obligations pursuant to confidentiality agreements or implied duties of confidence, the Management Services Agreement does not contain general confidentiality provisions.\nAdditionally, all of the Company's executive officers continue to have economic interests in NRG and, accordingly, the benefit to NRG from a transaction between the Company and NRG will proportionately inure to their benefit as holders of economic interests in NRG. NRG is a related person under the applicable securities laws governing related person transactions and may have interests which differ from the Company's interests or those of holders of the Class A and Class C common stock, including with respect to the types of acquisitions made, the timing and amount of dividends by the Company, the reinvestment of returns generated by the Company's operations, the use of leverage when making acquisitions and the appointment of outside advisors and service providers. Any material transaction between the Company and NRG will be subject to the Company's related person transaction policy, which will require prior approval of such transaction by the Company's Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee. Those of the Company's executive officers who have economic interests in NRG may be conflicted when advising the Company's Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee or otherwise participating in the negotiation or approval of such transactions. These executive officers have significant project- and industry-specific expertise that could prove beneficial to the Company's decision-making process and the absence of such strategic guidance could have a material adverse effect on the Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee's ability to evaluate any such transaction. Furthermore, the Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee and the Company's related person transaction approval policy may not insulate the Company from derivative claims with respect to related person transactions and the conflicts of interest described in this risk factor. Regardless of the merits of such claims, the Company may be required to expend significant management time and financial resources in the defense thereof. Additionally, to the extent the Company fails to appropriately deal with any such conflicts, it could negatively impact the Company's reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with the Company, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may be unable or unwilling to terminate the Management Services Agreement.\nThe Management Services Agreement provides that the Company may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to NRG upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) NRG defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained therein in a manner that results in material harm to the Company and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof is given to NRG; (ii) NRG engages in any act of fraud, misappropriation of funds or embezzlement that results in material harm to the Company; (iii) NRG is grossly negligent in the performance of its duties under the agreement and such negligence results in material harm to the Company; or (iv) upon the happening of certain events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of NRG. Furthermore, if the Company requests an amendment to the scope of services provided by NRG under the Management Services Agreement and is not able to agree with NRG as to a change to the service fee resulting from a change in the scope of services within 180 days of the request, the Company will be able to terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior notice to NRG. The Company will not be able to terminate the agreement for any other reason, including if NRG experiences a change of control, and the agreement continues in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms. If NRG's performance does not meet the expectations of investors, and the Company is unable to terminate the Management Services Agreement, the market price of the Class A and Class C common stock could suffer.\nIf NRG terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, or if the transition services to be provided by NRG to the Company in connection with the consummation of the NRG Transaction are inadequate or end, the Company may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all.\nThe Company relies on NRG to provide management services under the Management Services Agreement and has limited executive or senior management personnel independent from NRG. The Management Services Agreement provides that NRG may terminate the agreement upon 180 days prior written notice of termination to the Company if it defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained in the agreement in a manner that results in material harm and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice of the breach is given. If NRG terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, or if the transition services to be provided by NRG to the Company, in the event the NRG Transaction is consummated, are not adequate or end, the Company may be unable to contract with GIP or a substitute service provider on similar terms or at all, and the costs of substituting service providers may be substantial. In addition, in light of NRG's familiarity with the Company's assets, GIP or a substitute service provider may not be able to provide the same level of service due to lack of pre-existing synergies. If the Company cannot locate a service provider that is able to provide substantially similar services as NRG does under the Management Services Agreement on similar terms, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe liability of NRG is limited under the Company's arrangements with it and the Company has agreed to indemnify NRG against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NRG to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to the Company than it otherwise might if acting solely for its own account.\nUnder the Management Services Agreement, NRG does not assume any responsibility other than to provide or arrange for the provision of the services described in the Management Services Agreement in good faith. In addition, under the Management Services Agreement, the liability of NRG and its affiliates is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law to conduct involving bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence or, in the case of a criminal matter, action that was known to have been unlawful. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify NRG to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by an indemnified person or threatened in connection with the Company's operations, investments and activities or in respect of or arising from the Management Services Agreement or the services provided by NRG, except to the extent that the claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses are determined to have resulted from the conduct in respect of which such persons have liability as described above. These protections may result in NRG tolerating greater risks when making decisions than otherwise might be the case, including when determining whether to use leverage in connection with acquisitions. The indemnification arrangements to which NRG is a party may also give rise to legal claims for indemnification that are adverse to the Company and holders of its common stock.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s PPAs and project-level financing arrangements include provisions that would permit the counterparty to terminate the contract or accelerate maturity in the event NRG ceases to control or own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the Company.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s PPAs and project-level financing arrangements contain change in control provisions that provide the counterparty with a termination right or the ability to accelerate maturity in the event of a change of control of the Company without the counterparty's consent. These provisions are triggered in the event NRG ceases to own, directly or indirectly, capital stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s capital stock outstanding on such date, or, in some cases, if NRG ceases to be the majority owner, directly or indirectly, of the applicable project subsidiary. As a result, if NRG ceases to control, or in some cases, own a majority of the voting power of the Company, as is contemplated by the NRG Transaction, the counterparties could terminate such contracts or accelerate the maturity of such financing arrangements. Even though the Company\u2019s consent to the NRG Transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of consents from such counterparties, the Company may have to expend significant resources and funds to obtain the consents of such counterparties to the NRG Transaction and there can be no assurance that such counterparties will provide their consents at all. The termination of any of the Company\u2019s PPAs or the acceleration of the maturity of any of the Company\u2019s project-level financing could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company is a \u201ccontrolled company,\" controlled by NRG, and as a result, is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, NRG controls 55.1% of the Company's combined voting power and is able to elect all of the Company's board of directors. As a result, the Company is considered a \"controlled company\" for the purposes of the NYSE listing requirements. Additionally, the Company is expected to continue to be a \"controlled company\" if the NRG Transaction is consummated. As a \"controlled company,\" the Company is permitted to, and the Company may, opt out of the NYSE listing requirements that would require (i) a majority of the members of the Company's board of directors to be independent, (ii) that the Company establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent\ndirectors, or (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. The NYSE listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. While the Company has elected to have a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee consisting entirely of independent directors and to conduct an annual performance evaluation of these committees, the majority of the members of the Company\u2019s board of directors are not considered independent. Therefore, the Company\u2019s stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the applicable NYSE listing requirements. It is also possible that the interests of NRG or GIP (in the event the NRG Transaction is consummated) may in some circumstances conflict with the Company's interests and the interests of the holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in the Company\nThe Company may not be able to continue paying comparable or growing cash dividends to holders of its common stock in the future.\nThe amount of CAFD principally depends upon the amount of cash the Company generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of capital expenditures the Company makes;\n\u2022\nthe level of operating and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to NRG for services provided to the Company in accordance with the Management Services Agreement;\n\u2022\nvariations in revenues generated by the business, due to seasonality, weather, or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndebt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in working capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe Company's ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in the Company's debt agreements (including project-level financing and, if applicable, corporate debt); and\n\u2022\nother business risks affecting cash levels.\nAs a result of all these factors, the Company cannot guarantee that it will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay a specific level of cash dividends to holders of its Class A or Class C common stock. Furthermore, holders of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock should be aware that the amount of CAFD depends primarily on operating cash flow, and is not solely a function of profitability, which can be affected by non-cash items.\nThe Company may incur other expenses or liabilities during a period that could significantly reduce or eliminate its CAFD and, in turn, impair its ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock during the period. Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to pay dividends on the Company's Class A or Class C common stock is restricted and further limited by the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to make distributions to the Company, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing the Company's corporate debt and project-level financing. The project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities prior to COD and thereafter prohibit distributions to the Company unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of financial ratios. The Company's revolving credit facility also restricts the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or if the payment of the dividend would result in an event of default.\nNRG Yield LLC's CAFD will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in some cases significantly, due to seasonality. As a result, the Company may cause NRG Yield LLC to reduce the amount of cash it distributes to its members in a particular quarter to establish reserves to fund distributions to its members in future periods for which the cash distributions the Company would otherwise receive from NRG Yield LLC would be insufficient to fund its quarterly dividend. If the Company fails to cause NRG Yield LLC to establish sufficient reserves, the Company may not be able to maintain its quarterly dividend with respect to a quarter adversely affected by seasonality.\nFinally, dividends to holders of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock will be paid at the discretion of the Company's board of directors. The Company's board of directors may decrease the level, or entirely discontinue payment, of dividends.\nThe Company is a holding company and its only material asset is its interest in NRG Yield LLC, and the Company is accordingly dependent upon distributions from NRG Yield LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses.\nThe Company is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in NRG Yield LLC, a holding company that has no material assets other than its interest in NRG Yield Operating LLC, whose sole material assets are the project companies. None of the Company, NRG Yield LLC or NRG Yield Operating LLC has any independent means of generating revenue. The Company intends to continue to cause NRG Yield Operating LLC's subsidiaries to make distributions to NRG Yield Operating LLC and, in turn, make distributions to NRG Yield LLC, and, in turn, to make distributions to the Company in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by the Company. To the extent that the Company needs funds for a quarterly cash dividend to holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock or otherwise, and NRG Yield Operating LLC or NRG Yield LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds (including as a result of NRG Yield Operating LLC's operating subsidiaries being unable to make distributions), it could materially adversely affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition and limit the Company's ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock.\nMarket interest rates may have an effect on the value of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of shares of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock is the effective dividend yield of such shares (i.e., the yield as a percentage of the then market price of the Company's shares) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates but are steadily rising, may lead investors of shares of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock to expect a higher dividend yield and the Company's inability to increase its dividend as a result of an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient CAFD or otherwise, could result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market prices of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock as investors seek alternative investments with higher yield.\nIf the Company is deemed to be an investment company, the Company may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and the Company's activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for the Company to complete strategic acquisitions or effect combinations.\nIf the Company is deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act, the Company's business would be subject to applicable restrictions under the Investment Company Act, which could make it impracticable for the Company to continue its business as contemplated. The Company believes it is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because the Company is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. The Company intends to conduct its operations so that the Company will not be deemed an investment company. However, if the Company were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on the Company's capital structure and the Company's ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for the Company to continue its business as contemplated.\nMarket volatility may affect the price of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock.\nThe market price of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which the Company cannot predict or control, including general market and economic conditions, disruptions, downgrades, credit events and perceived problems in the credit markets; actual or anticipated variations in its quarterly operating results or dividends; changes in the Company's investments or asset composition; write-downs or perceived credit or liquidity issues affecting the Company's assets; market perception of NRG or the proposed NRG Transaction, the Company's business and the Company's assets; the Company's level of indebtedness and/or adverse market reaction to any indebtedness that the Company may incur in the future; the Company's ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all; loss of any major funding source; the termination of the Management Services Agreement or additions or departures of the Company's executive officers or NRG's key personnel; changes in market valuations of similar power generation companies; and speculation in the press or investment community regarding the Company, NRG or the proposed NRG Transaction.\nSecurities markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Any broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock.\nVolatility of market conditions may increase certain of the risks the Company faces.\nThe capital markets in general are often subject to volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Market volatility can affect the plans and perspectives of various market participants, including operating entities, consumers and financing providers, and may increase uncertainty and heighten some of the risks the Company faces. The Company and other companies may have to adjust their plans and priorities in light of such volatility.\nRisks that may increase as a result of market volatility include, but are not limited to, risks related to access to capital and liquidity and risks related to the performance of third parties, including NRG or GIP. The Company has significant relationships with, and in certain areas depends significantly on, NRG. In particular, NRG provides management and operational services and other support. Until the proposed NRG Transaction is consummated, the Company\u2019s growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional facilities from NRG and unaffiliated third parties. The Company interacts with or depends on NRG for many third-party acquisition opportunities and for operations and maintenance support on various pending and completed transactions. As a result, the Company\u2019s financial and operating performance and prospects, including the Company\u2019s ability to grow its dividend per share, may be affected by the performance, prospects, and priorities of NRG (including the consummation of the NRG Transaction), and material adverse developments at NRG or changes in its strategic priorities may materially affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, any significant disruption to the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets, or a significant increase in interest rates, could make it difficult for the Company to successfully acquire attractive projects from third parties and may also limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain debt or equity financing to complete such acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise adequate proceeds when needed to fund such acquisitions, the ability to grow the Company\u2019s project portfolio may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to implement its growth strategy and, ultimately, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProvisions of the Company's charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock, and could make it more difficult to change management.\nProvisions of the Company's restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock may consider favorable, including transactions in which such stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. This is because these provisions may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace or remove members of the Company's management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called upon a resolution approved by a majority of the Company's directors then in office;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nSection 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person that together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Additionally, the Company's restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person and any of its associate or affiliate companies in the aggregate, public utility or holding company from acquiring, other than secondary market transactions, an amount of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock sufficient to result in a transfer of control without the prior written consent of the Company's board of directors. Any such change of control, in addition to prior approval from the Company's board of directors, would require prior authorization from FERC. Similar restrictions may apply to certain purchasers of the Company's securities which are holding companies regardless of whether the Company's securities are purchased in offerings by the Company or NRG, in open market transactions or otherwise. A purchaser of the Company's securities which is a holding company will need to determine whether a given purchase of the Company's securities may require prior FERC approval.\nInvestors may experience dilution of ownership interest due to the future issuance of additional shares of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock.\nThe Company is in a capital intensive business, and may not have sufficient funds to finance the growth of the Company's business, future acquisitions or to support the Company's projected capital expenditures. As a result, the Company may require additional funds from further equity or debt financings, including tax equity financing transactions, sales under the ATM Program or sales of preferred shares or convertible debt to complete future acquisitions, expansions and capital expenditures and pay the general and administrative costs of the Company's business. In the future, the Company may issue shares under its ATM Program and the Company's previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of purchasers of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock. Under the Company's restated certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 500,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, 1,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock, 1,000,000,000 shares of Class D common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by the Company's board of directors. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or convertible debt may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, the Company's business or the Company's market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Company's Class A and/or Class C common stock adversely, the stock price and trading volume of the Company's Class A and/or Class C common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company's Class A and Class C common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Company, the Company's business, the Company's market or the Company's competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding the Company's Class A and/or Class C common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about the Company's competitors, the price of the Company's Class A and/or Class C common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price or trading volume of the Company's Class A and/or Class C common stock to decline.\nFuture sales of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock by NRG may cause the price of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock to fall.\nThe market price of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock could decline as a result of sales by NRG of such shares (issuable to NRG upon the exchange of some or all of its NRG Yield LLC Class B or Class D units, respectively) in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.\nThe market price of the Company's Class A or Class C common stock may also decline as a result of NRG disposing or transferring some or all of the Company's outstanding Class B or Class D common stock, which disposals or transfers would reduce NRG's ownership interest in, and voting control over, the Company, as contemplated by the proposed NRG Transaction. These sales might also make it more difficult for the Company to sell equity securities at a time and price that the Company deems appropriate. NRG and certain of its affiliates have certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to shares of the Company's Class A common stock issuable upon the exchange of NRG Yield LLC's Class B units and/or Class C common stock issuable upon the exchange of NRG Yield LLC's Class D units. The presence of additional shares of the Company's Class A and/or Class C common stock trading in the public market, as a result of the exercise of such registration rights, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company's securities.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nThe Company's future tax liability may be greater than expected if the Company does not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income, if federal, state and local tax authorities challenge certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions and exemptions or if changes in federal, state and local tax laws occur.\nThe Company expects to generate NOLs and carryforward prior year NOL balances to offset future taxable income. Based on the Company's current portfolio of assets, which include renewable assets that benefit from accelerated tax depreciation deductions, the Company does not expect to pay significant federal income tax for a period of approximately ten years. While the Company expects these losses will be available as a future benefit, in the event that they are not generated as expected, successfully challenged by the IRS or state and local jurisdictions (in a tax audit or otherwise) or subject to future limitations from a potential change in ownership as discussed below, the Company's ability to realize these benefits may be limited. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to realize state and local tax exemptions, including property or sales and use tax exemptions, is subject to various tax laws. If these exemptions are successfully challenged by state and local jurisdictions or if a change in tax law occurs,\nthe Company\u2019s ability to realize these exemptions could be affected. A reduction in the Company's expected NOLs, a limitation on the Company's ability to use such losses or tax credits, and challenges by tax authorities to the Company\u2019s tax positions may result in a material increase in the Company's estimated future income, sales/use and property tax liability and may negatively impact the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Company's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nThe Company's ability to use NOLs could be substantially limited if the Company were to experience an \"ownership change\" as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \"ownership change\" would occur if the Company's \"5-percent shareholders,\" as defined under Section 382 of the Code, collectively increased their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change deferred tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Future sales of any class of the Company's common stock by NRG, as well as future issuances by the Company, could contribute to a potential ownership change.\nA valuation allowance may be required for the Company's deferred tax assets.\nThe Company's expected NOLs and tax credits will be reflected as a deferred tax asset as they are generated until utilized to offset income. Valuation allowances may need to be maintained for deferred tax assets that the Company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event that the Company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nDistributions to holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock may be taxable.\nThe amount of distributions that will be treated as taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on the amount of the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits. It is difficult to predict whether the Company will generate earnings or profits as computed for federal income tax purposes in any given tax year. Generally, a corporation's earnings and profits are computed based upon taxable income, with certain specified adjustments. Distributions will constitute ordinary dividend income to the extent paid from the Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits, and a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of a stockholder's basis in his or her Class A or Class C common stock. Distributions in excess of the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a stockholder's basis will be treated as gain from the sale of the common stock.\nFor U.S. tax purposes, the Company's distributions to its stockholders in 2017 and 2016 are classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a nontaxable return of capital and reduction of a U.S. stockholder's tax basis, to the extent of a U.S. stockholder's tax basis in each of the Company's common shares, with any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K of NRG Yield, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
