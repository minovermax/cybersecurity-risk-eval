{"cik": "1425287", "company": "AMP Holding Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. \t RISK FACTORS\nOur results of operations have not resulted in profitability and we may not be able to achieve profitability going forward.\nWe have incurred net losses amounting to $34.1 million for the period from inception (February 20, 2007) through December 31, 2014. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had a working capital deficiency of $2.3 million. We have had net losses in each quarter since our inception. We expect that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this prospectus, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Our management is developing plans to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described above and there is no guarantee that such plans will be successfully implemented. Our business plan has changed from concentrating on the electric passenger vehicle market to the electric medium duty trucks, but is still unproven. There is no assurance that even if we successfully implement our business plan, that we will be able to curtail our losses. Further, as we are a development stage enterprise, we expect that net losses and the working capital deficiency will continue. If we incur additional significant operating losses, our stock price may decline, perhaps significantly.\nWe have yet to achieve positive cash flow and, given our projected funding needs, our ability to generate positive cash flow is uncertain.\nWe have had negative cash flow from operating activities of $4.5 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We anticipate that we will continue to have negative cash flow from operating and investing activities for the foreseeable future as we expect to incur increased research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses and make significant capital expenditures in our efforts to increase sales and commence operations at our Union City facility. Our business also will at times require significant amounts of working capital to support our growth, particularly as we acquire inventory to support our anticipated increase in production. An inability to generate positive cash flow for the foreseeable future may adversely affect our ability to raise needed capital for our business on reasonable terms, diminish supplier or customer willingness to enter into transactions with us, and have other adverse effects that may decrease our long-term viability. There can be no assurance we will achieve positive cash flow in the foreseeable future.\nWe need access to additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm issued a report on our 2014 financial statements that contains an explanatory paragraph stating that the lack of sales, negative working capital and stockholders\u2019 deficit, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot access additional financing when we need it and on acceptable terms, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and ability to continue as a going concern could be adversely affected.\nOur growth-oriented business plan to design, produce, sell and service commercial electric vehicles through our Union City facility will require continued capital investment. Our research and development activities will require continued investment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm issued a report on our 2014 financial statements that contains an explanatory paragraph stating that the lack of sales, negative working capital and stockholders\u2019 deficit, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to implement our operations through June 30, 2015, we will need to raise approximately $10 million and to fully implement our business plan through December 31, 2016 we will need to raise approximately $20 million. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research, development and design efforts, open our sales, service and assembly facilities, improve infrastructure and introduce new or improve existing vehicle models. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all, particularly given that we do not now have a committed credit facility with any government or financial institution. If we cannot obtain additional financing when we need it and on terms acceptable to us, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and ability to continue as a going concern could be adversely affected.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance.\nWe have basically been a research and development company since beginning operations in February 2007. We have a limited operating history and have generated limited revenue. As we move more toward a manufacturing environment it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price.\nFailure to successfully integrate the Workhorse \u00ae brand, logo, intellectual property, patents and assembly plant in Union City, Indiana into our operations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our strategy to become an OEM, in March 2013, we acquired Workhorse and the Workhorse Assets including the Workhorse \u00ae brand, logo, intellectual property, patents and assembly plant in Union City, Indiana. The Workhorse acquisition may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business, the failure to retain key Workhorse dealers and our ability to commence operations at the plant in Union City, Indiana. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate the Workhorse Assets.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot reduce and adequately control the costs and expenses associated with operating our business, including our material and production costs.\nWe incur significant costs and expenses related to procuring the materials, components and services required to develop and produce our electric vehicles. We have secured supply agreements for our critical components including our batteries. However, these are dependent on volume to ensure that they are available at a competitive price. As a result, our current cost projections are considerably higher than the projected revenue stream that such vehicles will produce. As a result we are continually working on initiatives to reduce our cost structure so that we may effectively compete. If we do not properly manage our costs and expenses our net losses will continue which will negatively impact our stock price.\nIf we are unable to pay off the outstanding amount owed under the debenture in the principal amount of $2,250,000 that is secured against all of the assets of AMP Trucks including the Workhorse brand and the Union City facility and such lien holder were to take possession of such assets, our operations would be severely negatively impacted if not curtailed.\nOn March 4, 2013, AMP Trucks entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Workhorse Custom Chassis, LLC (\u201cWCC\u201d), an Illinois limited liability company and a wholly-owned affiliate of Navistar International Corporation, to purchase certain assets including the Workhorse \u00ae brand, logo, intellectual property, patents and approximately 250,000 sq. ft. of facilities on 48 acres of land in Union City, Indiana (the \u201cAssets\u201d). On March 13, 2013, AMP Trucks closed the acquisition of the Assets from WCC for a purchase price of $5,000,000 of which $2,750,000 was paid in cash and the delivery of a Secured Debenture (the \u201cDebenture\u201d) in the principal amount of $2,250,000. The Debenture is secured pursuant to a Security Agreement (the \u201cSecurity Agreement\u201d) and a Mortgage, Security Agreement, Assignment of Rents and Fixture Filing (the \u201cMortgage\u201d) entered between AMP Trucks and WCC. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, AMP Trucks granted WCC a security interest in all of the assets of AMP Trucks in order to secure the prompt payment, performance and discharge in full of all of obligations of AMP Trucks under the Debenture. Pursuant to the Mortgage, the Debenture is secured by the real estate and related assets of the plant located in Union City, Indiana. The Debenture matures three years from its effective date of March 13, 2013 (the \"Maturity Date\") and interest associated with the Debenture is 10% per annum, which is payable on the Maturity Date. AMP Trucks may prepay outstanding principal and interest of the Debenture in full at any time. In the event AMP Trucks prepays outstanding principal and interest, it shall pay an amount equal to all outstanding principal and interest multiplied by 105%. AMP Holding and AMP guaranteed the payment of the Debenture.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the willingness of operators of commercial vehicle fleets to adopt electric vehicles and on our ability to produce, sell and service vehicles that meet their needs. If the market for commercial electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur growth is dependent upon the adoption of electric vehicles by operators of commercial vehicle fleets and on our ability to produce, sell and service vehicles that meet their needs. The entry of commercial electric vehicles into the medium-duty commercial vehicle market is a relatively new development, particularly in the United States, and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving government regulation, industry standards and customer views of the merits of using electric vehicles in their businesses. This process has been slow as without including the impact of government or other subsidies and incentives, the purchase prices for our commercial electric vehicles currently is higher than the purchase prices for diesel-fueled vehicles. As part of our sales efforts, we must educate fleet managers as to the economical savings during the life of the vehicle. As such, we believe that operators of commercial vehicle fleets consider a number of factors when deciding whether to purchase our commercial electric vehicles (or commercial electric vehicles generally) or vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, particularly diesel-fueled or natural gas-fueled vehicles. We believe these factors include:\n\u25cf the difference in the initial purchase prices of commercial electric vehicles and vehicles with comparable GVWs powered by internal combustion engines, both including and excluding the impact of government and other subsidies and incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric vehicles;\n\u25cf the total cost of ownership of the vehicle over its expected life, which includes the initial purchase price and ongoing operating and maintenance costs;\n\u25cf the availability and terms of financing options for purchases of vehicles and, for commercial electric vehicles, financing options for battery systems;\n\u25cf the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles and future regulations requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;\n\u25cf government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u25cf fuel prices, including volatility in the cost of diesel;\n\u25cf the cost and availability of other alternatives to diesel fueled vehicles, such as vehicles powered by natural gas;\n\u25cf corporate sustainability initiatives;\n\u25cf commercial electric vehicle quality, performance and safety (particularly with respect to lithium-ion battery packs);\n\u25cf the quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts;\n\u25cf the limited range over which commercial electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;\n\u25cf access to charging stations and related infrastructure costs, and standardization of electric vehicle charging systems;\n\u25cf electric grid capacity and reliability; and\n\u25cf macroeconomic factors.\nIf, in weighing these factors, operators of commercial vehicle fleets determine that there is not a compelling business justification for purchasing commercial electric vehicles, particularly those that we produce and sell, then the market for commercial electric vehicles may not develop as we expect or may develop more slowly than we expect, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our customers are unable to efficiently and effectively integrate our electric vehicles into their existing commercial fleets our sales may suffer and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur sales strategy involves a comprehensive plan for the pilot and roll-out of our electric vehicles, as well as the ongoing replacement of existing commercial vehicles with our electric vehicles, that is tailored to the individual needs of our customers. If we are unable to develop and execute fleet integration strategies or fleet management support services that meet our customers' unique circumstances with minimal disruption to their businesses, our customers may not realize the economic benefits they expect from our electric vehicles. If this were to occur, our customers may not order additional vehicles from us, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe currently do not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing which exposes us to fluctuations in component, materials and equipment prices. Substantial increases in these prices would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nBecause we currently do not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing, we are subject to fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials, parts and components and equipment we use in the production of our vehicles. Substantial increases in the prices for such raw materials, components and equipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase the announced or expected prices of our vehicles in response to increased costs could be viewed negatively by our customers and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to scale our operations at our Union City facility in an expedited manner from our limited low volume production to high volume production, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe are currently assembling our orders at our Union City facility which is acceptable for our existing orders. In order to satisfy increased demand, we will need to quickly scale operations in our Union City facility as well as scale our supply chain including access to batteries. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience disruptions in our supply chain, if we cannot obtain materials of sufficient quality at reasonable prices or if we are unable to scale our Union City facility.\nWe depend upon key personnel and need additional personnel.\nOur success depends on the continuing services of Stephen Burns, CEO, and Martin J. Rucidlo, President. On December 8, 2010, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Burns for a term of two years which automatically renews for one year periods unless either of the parties elects to not renew for such period. Mr. Rucidlo is not engaged under a long-term employment agreement. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. Additionally, the success of our operations will largely depend upon its ability to successfully attract and maintain competent and qualified key management personnel. As with any company with limited resources, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to attract such individuals or that the presence of such individuals will necessarily translate into profitability for our company. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business operations. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement, and manage the changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face competition. A few of our competitors have greater financial or other resources, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do and one or more of these competitors could use their greater resources and/or name recognition to gain market share at our expense or could make it very difficult for us to establish market share.\nCompanies currently competing in the fleet logistics market offering alternative fuel medium duty trucks include Ford Motor Company and Freightliner. In the electric medium duty truck market in the United States, we compete with a few other manufacturers, including Electric Vehicles International and Smith Electric Vehicles. Ford and Freightliner have more significant financial resources, established market positions, long-standing relationships with customers and dealers, and who have more significant name recognition, technical, marketing, sales, financial and other resources than we do. Ford and Freightliner are currently selling alternative fuel fleet vehicles including hybrids. The resources available to our competitors to develop new products and introduce them into the marketplace exceed the resources currently available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time that we can. This intense competitive environment may require us to make changes in our products, pricing, licensing, services, distribution, or marketing to develop a market position. Each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in our target markets which could have an adverse effect on our position in our industry and on our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position.\nThere are companies in the electric vehicle industry that have developed or are developing vehicles and technologies that compete or will compete with our vehicles. We cannot assure that our competitors will not be able to duplicate our technology or provide products and services similar to ours more efficiently. If for any reason we are unable to keep pace with changes in electric vehicle technology, particularly battery technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected. We plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide electric vehicles that incorporate the latest technology. However, there is no assurance that our research and development efforts will keep pace with those of our competitors.\nOur electric vehicles compete for market share with vehicles powered by other vehicle technologies that may prove to be more attractive than ours.\nOur target market currently is serviced by manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers using proven and widely accepted fuel technologies. Additionally, our competitors are working on developing technologies that may be introduced in our target market. If any of these alternative technology vehicles can provide lower fuel costs, greater efficiencies, greater reliability or otherwise benefit from other factors resulting in an overall lower total cost of ownership, this may negatively affect the commercial success of our vehicles or make our vehicles uncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe currently have a limited number of customers, with whom we do not have long-term agreements, and expect that a significant portion of our future sales will be from a limited number of customers and the loss of any of these high volume customers could materially harm our business.\nA significant portion of our projected future revenue, if any, is generated from a limited number of vehicle customers. Additionally, much of our business model is focused on building relationships with large customers. Currently we have no contracts with customers that include long-term commitments or minimum volumes that ensure future sales of vehicles. As such, a customer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot anticipate or control, such as reasons related to the customer\u2019s financial condition, changes in the customer\u2019s business strategy or operations or as the result of the perceived performance or cost-effectiveness of our vehicles. The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to our most significant customers could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in the market for electric vehicles could cause our products to become obsolete or lose popularity.\nThe modern electric vehicle industry is in its infancy and has experienced substantial change in the last few years. To date, demand for and interest in electric vehicles has been slower than forecasted by industry experts. As a result, growth in the electric vehicle industry depends on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf continued development of product technology, especially batteries\n\u25cf the environmental consciousness of customers\n\u25cf the ability of electric vehicles to successfully compete with vehicles powered by internal combustion engines\n\u25cf limitation of widespread electricity shortages; and\n\u25cf whether future regulation and legislation requiring increased use of non-polluting vehicles is enacted\nWe cannot assume that growth in the electric vehicle industry will continue. Our business may suffer if the electric vehicle industry does not grow or grows more slowly than it has in recent years or if we are unable to maintain the pace of industry demands.\nThe unavailability, reduction, elimination or adverse application of government subsidies, incentives and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe believe that, currently, the availability of government subsidies and incentives including those available in New York, California and Chicago is an important factor considered by our customers when purchasing our vehicles, and that our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and incentives because of budgetary challenges, policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of electric vehicles or other reasons may result in the diminished price competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry.\nWe may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position.\nOur current products are designed for use with, and are dependent upon, existing electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our products in order to continue to provide products with the latest technology. However, our products may become obsolete or our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in or to create the necessary technology. As a result, our potential inability to adapt and develop the necessary technology may harm our competitive position.\nThe failure of certain key suppliers to provide us with components could have a severe and negative impact upon our business.\nWe have secured supply agreements for our critical components including our batteries. However, these are dependent on volume to ensure that they are available at a competitive price. Further, we rely on a small group of suppliers to provide us with components for our products. If these suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide components or if we are unable to meet certain volume requirements in our existing supply agreements, there are a limited number of alternative suppliers who could provide them. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could affect our ability to receive components from our suppliers. Further, it could be difficult to find replacement components if our current suppliers fail to provide the parts needed for these products. A failure by our major suppliers to provide these components could severely restrict our ability to manufacture our products and prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion.\nProduct liability or other claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims, product recalls, and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of electrical vehicles. Although we have product liability insurance for our consumer and commercial products, that insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential product claims. We also carry liability insurance on our products. Any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates. We cannot provide assurance that such claims and/or recalls will not be made in the future.\nWe may have to devote substantial resources to implementing a retail product distribution network.\nDealers are often hesitant to provide their own financing to contribute to our product distribution network. As a result, we anticipate that we may have to provide financing or other consignment sale arrangements for dealers. A capital investment such as this presents many risks, foremost among them being that we may not realize a significant return on our investment if the network is not profitable. Our inability to collect receivables from dealers could cause us to suffer losses. Lastly, the amount of time that our management will need to devote to this project may divert them from performing other functions necessary to assure the success of our business.\nRegulatory requirements may have a negative impact upon our business.\nWhile our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under federal, state, and local laws, we believe that our vehicles are or will be materially in compliance with all applicable laws. However, to the extent the laws change, or if we introduce new vehicles in the future, some or all of our vehicles may not comply with applicable federal, state, or local laws. Further, certain federal, state, and local laws and industrial standards currently regulate electrical and electronics equipment. Although standards for electric vehicles are not yet generally available or accepted as industry standards, our products may become subject to federal, state, and local regulation in the future. Compliance with these regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive.\nOur products are subject to environmental and safety compliance with various federal and state regulations, including regulations promulgated by the EPA, NHTSA, and various state boards, and compliance certification is required for each new model year. The cost of these compliance activities and the delays and risks associated with obtaining approval can be substantial. The risks, delays, and expenses incurred in connection with such compliance could be substantial.\nOur success may be dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology as well as several registered patents and one patent application. Our patents relate to the vehicle chassis assembly, vehicle header and drive module and manifold for electric motor drive assembly. Our existing patent application relates to the onboard generator drive system for electric vehicles. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain additional trademarks and patents. We are working on obtaining patents and trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office but have not finalized any as of this date. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants, we cannot be certain that others will not gain access to these trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nWe may be exposed to liability for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of other companies.\nOur success will, in part, depend on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Although we have conducted searches and are not aware of any patents and trademarks which our products or their use might infringe, we cannot be certain that infringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs, in addition to the great amount of time lost, in defending any patent or trademark infringement suits or in asserting any patent or trademark rights, in a suit with another party.\nOur electric vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, on rare occasions have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flames. If such events occur in our electric vehicles, we could face liability for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe battery packs in our electric vehicles use lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptop computers and cell phones. On rare occasions, if not appropriately managed and controlled, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials.\nOur facilities could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or other unpredictable events. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our facility would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe engineer and assemble our electric vehicles in a facility in Loveland, Ohio and we intend to locate the assembly function to our facility in Union City. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our facility, whether due to technical, information systems, communication networks, accidents, weather conditions or other natural disaster, or otherwise, whether short or long-term, would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results .\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting the company at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur due to stock price appreciation.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock. We cannot assure that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.\nWe have not voluntary implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflict of interest and similar matters.\nRecent Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ, on which their securities are listed. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of Sarbanes Oxley measures in formulating their investment decisions.\nWe may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX 404\"), the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring smaller reporting companies, such as our company, to include a report of management on the company's internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2007. We were required to include the management report in annual reports starting with the year ending December 31, 2009. Previous SEC rules required a non-accelerated filer to include an attestation report in its annual report for years ending on or after June 15, 2010. Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Act added SOX Section 404(c) to exempt from the attestation requirement smaller issuers that are neither accelerated filers nor large accelerated filers under Rule 12b-2. Under Rule 12b-2, subject to periodic and annual reporting criteria, an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d is an issuer with market value of $75 million, but less than $700 million; a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d is an issuer with market value of $700 million or greater. As a result, the exemption effectively applies to companies with less than $75 million in market capitalization.\nThe trading of our common stock is limited under the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations, which will adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock is currently less than $5.00 per share and, as a result, our common stock is considered a \"penny stock\u201d, and trading in our common stock would be subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. Generally, the broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent prior to the transaction.\nSEC regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a \"penny stock,\" including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities. In addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules, other risks associated with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market. An active and liquid market in our common stock may never develop due to these factors.", "PERMNO": 15914, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "WKHS"}
