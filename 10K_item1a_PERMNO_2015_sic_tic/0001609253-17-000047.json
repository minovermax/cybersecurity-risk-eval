The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nCommodity pricing can fluctuate widely and strongly affects our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and ability to grow.\nOur financial results, financial condition, cash flow and ability to grow correlate closely to the prices we obtain for our products. Compared to the 2014 average, global energy commodity prices have declined significantly. For example, Brent crude prices declined from over $110 per barrel in June 2014 to below $30 per barrel in January 2016. While prices remain lower than the 2014 and 2015 averages, they have improved modestly since early 2016. However, such improvements may not continue or may be reversed. Continued low prices for our products or further price decreases could have several adverse effects including:\n\u2022\nreduced cash flow and decreased funds available for capital investments, interest payments and operational expenses;\n\u2022\nreduced proved oil and gas reserves over time and related cash flows;\n\u2022\nimpairments of our oil and gas properties such as we experienced in 2014 and 2015;\n\u2022\nreduced borrowing base capacity under our first-out revolving credit facility as proved oil and gas reserves values fall;\n\u2022\nthe potential for a reduction of our liquidity, mandatory loan repayments and default and foreclosure by our banks and bondholders against our secured assets;\n\u2022\ninability to attract counterparties to our transactions, including hedging transactions; and\n\u2022\ninability to access funds through the capital markets and the price we could obtain for, or our ability to conduct, asset sales or other monetization transactions.\nCommodity pricing can fluctuate widely and is affected by a variety of factors, including changes in consumption patterns; inventory levels; global and local economic conditions; the actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments; actual or threatened production, refining and processing disruptions; worldwide drilling and exploration activities; the effects of conservation; weather, geophysical and technical limitations; currency exchange rates; technological advances and regional market conditions; transportation capacity, bottlenecks and costs in producing areas; alternative energy sources; other matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for our products; and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions. These and other factors make it impossible to predict realized prices reliably. While our hedging activities provide some protection for a significant portion of our 2017 production, they may not adequately protect us from commodity price reductions and we may be unable to enter into acceptable additional hedges.\nOur lenders require us to comply with covenants and can limit our borrowing capabilities, which may materially limit our ability to use or access capital and our business activities.\nOur ability to borrow funds under our reserves-based first-lien first-out credit facilities is limited by the size of our lenders' commitments, our ability to comply with their covenants, our borrowing base and a minimum monthly liquidity requirement. At January 31, 2017, the lenders' commitments under our first-out facilities were $2.05 billion, and we had approximately $486 million in availability, subject to the minimum liquidity requirement. We may need to depend on our revolving credit facility for a portion of our future capital or operating needs.\nThe financial covenants that we must satisfy under our first-out facilities include quarterly first-out leverage and interest expense coverage ratios, as well as a semi-annual first-lien asset coverage ratio. The first-out facilities also restrict our ability to monetize assets and issue or purchase debt as a means of complying with our financial covenants. Our borrowing base under our first-out facilities, which currently exceeds lender commitments, is redetermined each May 1 and November 1. The borrowing base is determined with reference to a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserves. Restrictions under our first-out credit facilities are further described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facilities.\"\nIf we were to breach any of the covenants under our first-out facilities, our lenders would be permitted to accelerate the principal amount due under the first-out facilities and foreclose against the assets securing them. If payment were accelerated, or we failed to make certain payments, under our first-out facilities, it would result in a default under our second-out credit facility and outstanding notes and permit acceleration and foreclosure against the assets securing the second-out credit facility and the secured notes.\nLow commodity prices, coupled with substantial interest payments, could constrain our liquidity. A significant reduction in our liquidity may force us to take actions which could have significant adverse effects.\nThe primary source of liquidity and resources to fund our capital program and other obligations is cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As noted above, our borrowing capacity is limited.\nFurther price declines would reduce our cash flows from operations and may limit our access to borrowing capacity or cause default under our credit facilities or notes. Under these conditions, if we were unable to achieve improved liquidity through additional financing, asset monetizations, restructuring of our debt obligations, equity issuances or otherwise, cash flow from operations and expected available credit capacity could be insufficient to meet our commitments. Successfully completing these actions could have significant adverse effects such as higher operating and financing costs, loss of certain tax attributes or dilution of equity. For example, our repurchases of unsecured notes in 2016 resulted in the elimination of federal net operating losses. In 2016, we incurred debt under a second-out credit facility that, together with our 2015 exchange, increased our annual interest expense.\nWe have significant indebtedness and may incur more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business or otherwise limit our operational flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $5.3 billion of consolidated indebtedness comprised of senior unsecured notes, second lien secured notes and first-out and second-out secured credit facility borrowings.\nOur credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness as well as certain defined obligations unrestricted by debt incurrence or lien covenants, or that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent we need to incur indebtedness above amounts permitted by our credit facilities, we may seek amendments or waivers.\nIndebtedness outstanding under our first-out and second-out facilities bears interest at variable rates, therefore a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not purchase interest rate hedges.\nOur level of indebtedness may have several important consequences, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\njeopardizing our ability to execute our business plans;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in our business and in economic and industry conditions generally, and putting us at a disadvantage against competitors that have lower fixed obligations and more cash flow to devote to their businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital investments and general corporate and other purposes or increasing the cost of that capital; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to operate our business, compete for capital, react to competitive pressures, address adverse regulatory changes and engage in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nThe terms of the credit facilities and note indentures may limit, among other things:\n\u2022\nincurrence of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ninvestments;\n\u2022\namounts and types of joint ventures;\n\u2022\nrestricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreation of liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nsales of assets that constitute collateral;\n\u2022\napplication of the full proceeds of asset sales other than to pay down debt;\n\u2022\nmergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nrelease of collateral.\nThese limitations are further described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facilities; Senior Notes\" and the documents governing our indebtedness that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other financial needs will depend on our future performance or our ability to further reduce our debt, which will be affected by market, financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional equity on terms that may be unattractive, if it can be done at all. Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default. Any of these factors could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations and a default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of all of our debt and foreclosure against assets constituting collateral for our secured credit facilities and secured notes.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments, which may include acquisitions. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital investments for the development and exploration of oil and gas reserves. Our ability to deploy capital as planned depends on a number of variables, including: (i) commodity prices and market access; (ii) regulatory and third-party approvals; (iii) our ability to timely drill, complete and stimulate wells due to technical factors and contract terms; (iv) the availability of, and our ability to compete for, capital, equipment, services and personnel; (v) drilling and completion costs and results and (vi) our ability to compete for acquisitions or otherwise match the prices offered by our competitors. Capital availability may be reduced (i) by our lenders, (ii) due to joint venture partners\u2019 perceptions of the quality of our assets or credit risk or (iii) as a result of capital market constraints or poor stock price performance. Because of these and other potential variables, we may be unable to deploy capital in the manner planned, which may constrain our development or acquisition activities.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nMany uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and related future net cash flows. Our estimates are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nThe Brent oil price used for reserve calculations decreased from $55.57 per barrel for 2015 to $42.90 per barrel for 2016. As a result, we experienced negative price-related revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 of 60 MMBoe. Generally, lower prices adversely affect the quantity of our reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. In addition, a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria under the applicable rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit.\nIn addition, our reserves information represents estimates prepared by internal engineers. Although over 80% of our 2016 proved reserve estimates were audited by our independent petroleum engineers, Ryder Scott Company, L.P., we cannot guarantee that the estimates are accurate. Reserves estimation is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows from those reserves depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from similar areas;\n\u2022\nthe quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices;\n\u2022\nproduction and operating costs;\n\u2022\nad valorem, excise and income taxes;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs;\n\u2022\nthe effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture workover and asset retirement costs.\nMisunderstanding of these variables, inaccurate assumptions, changed circumstances or new information could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions.\nWe currently expect improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to be our main sources for reserves additions. However, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates could materially affect the net present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our borrowing base and liquidity under our reserves-based first-out credit facilities, as well as our results of operations.\nRisks related to our disposition and acquisition activities could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur disposition activities, including joint ventures, carry risks that we may (i) not be able to realize reasonable prices or rates of return for assets we sell or contribute to joint ventures; (ii) be required to retain liabilities that are greater than desired or anticipated; (iii) lose synergies among elements of our business and (iv) the revenue lost or costs to replace the services from assets sold could reduce our borrowing base and cash flows. Our acquisition activities carry risks that we may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market\u2019s evaluation of the activity; and (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. Successful acquisitions of oil and gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing for recovering the reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and incomplete, and we may be unable to make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy.\nUnless we replace crude oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Reduced capital investment may result in a decline in our reserves. Our ability to make the necessary long-term capital investments or acquisitions needed to maintain or expand our reserves may be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations or external sources of capital are insufficient. We may not be successful in developing, exploring for or acquiring additional reserves. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nOur business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change legal requirements governing our operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. In addition, certain of these laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nSee \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, stimulation, operation, maintenance, transportation, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment, fluid injection and disposal and water recycling and reuse. Failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or limiting our operations. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, and the businesses that transport our products to customers are also highly regulated. For example, federal and state pipeline safety agencies have adopted or proposed regulations to expand their jurisdiction to include more gas and liquid gathering lines and pipelines and to impose additional mechanical integrity requirements. The state has adopted additional regulations on the storage of natural gas that could affect the demand or availability of such storage, increase seasonal volatility, or otherwise affect the prices we receive from customers.\nCosts of compliance may increase and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations, each of which has occurred in the past.\nGovernment authorities and other organizations continue to study health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground movement or seismicity and natural resources. Government authorities have also adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, well construction and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and gas operations. Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, and preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, which could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition.\nFor recent examples relating to well stimulation, water management and fluid injection see \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\u201d\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas carry significant operational and financial risk and uncertainty. We may not drill our identified sites at the times we scheduled or at all, and sites we decide to drill may not yield crude oil or natural gas in economically producible quantities.\nOur decisions to explore, develop, purchase or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of geophysical, geologic, engineering, production and other technical data and processes; the analysis of which is often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our decisions and ultimate profitability are also affected by crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity, political resistance and other factors. Our cost of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, maintaining and abandoning wells is also often uncertain. Our production cost per barrel are higher than that of many of our peers due to the extraction methods we use, the large number of wells we operate and the effects of our PSC contracts. Overruns in budgeted investments are a common risk that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecast. We bear the risks of equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance, including production response to improved recovery or enhanced recovery efforts, and other associated risks.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate. We cannot guarantee that these prospective drilling locations or any other drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented approximately 20% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2016.\nPart of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\nThe risk profile for our exploration and prospective drilling locations is higher than for other locations because we have less geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular for our prospective resource locations, which are in unproven geologic plays. We may not find commercial amounts of oil or natural gas, in which case the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and could be impaired. We may increase the proportion of our drilling in new or emerging plays over time.\nOne of our important assets is our acreage in the Monterey shale play in the San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Ventura basins. The geology of the Monterey shale is highly complex and not uniform due to localized and varied faulting and changes in structure and rock characteristics. As a result, it differs from other shale plays that can be developed in part on the basis of their uniformity. Instead, individual Monterey shale drilling sites may need to be more fully understood and may require a more precise development approach, which could affect our ability, the timing or the cost to develop this asset.\nOur commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nOur current commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels determined under the derivative instruments we use to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:\n\u2022\na change in price basis differentials;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; and\n\u2022\nan event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices in the opposite direction of our derivative positions.\nTax law changes may adversely affect our operations.\nIn California, there have been proposals for new taxes on oil and gas production. Although the proposals have not become law, campaigns by various interest groups could lead to future additional oil and gas severance or other taxes. The imposition of such taxes could significantly reduce our profit margins and cash flow and could ultimately result in lower oil and natural gas production, which may reduce our capital investments and growth plans.\nOur producing properties are located in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are concentrated in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional conditions. These include local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations, and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and transportation capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. The concentration of our operations in California and limited local storage options also increase our exposure to events such as natural disasters, mechanical failures, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, prevent development of lease inventory before expiration and limit access to markets for our products.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the CFTC to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, and these rules may affect both the size of positions that we may enter and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect our operations or results.\nConcerns about climate change and regulation of GHGs and other air quality issues may materially affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, and reducing demand for, and consumption of, our products and services, and we may be unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to such issues may increase our operating costs and render certain wells or projects uneconomic. As these requirements become more stringent, we may be unable to implement them in a cost-effective manner. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could adversely impact our cost of, and access to, capital. Both California and the EPA have adopted laws, and policies that seek to reduce GHG emissions as discussed in \"Business - Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\" In 2016, we incurred costs of approximately $33 million for mandatory GHG emissions allowances in California, and costs of such allowances per metric ton of GHG emissions are expected to increase in the future as CARB tightens program requirements.\nIn addition, other current and proposed international agreements and federal and state laws, regulations and policies seek to restrict or reduce the use of petroleum products in transportation fuels and electricity generation, impose additional taxes and costs on producers and consumers of petroleum products and require or subsidize the use of renewable energy.\nGovernmental authorities can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. In addition, California air quality laws and regulations, particularly in southern and central California where most of our operations are located, are in most instances more stringent than analogous federal laws and regulations. For example, despite achieving significant emissions reductions, the San Joaquin Valley will be required to adopt more rigorous attainment plans under the Clean Air Act to comply with federal ozone and particulate matter standards, and these efforts could affect our activities in the region.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and gas exploration and production activities, including well drilling, completion, stimulation, maintenance and abandonment activities, are subject to oil and gas operational risks such as fires, explosions, releases, discharges, equipment failures and industrial accidents. Other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, fires, droughts, terrorist attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may adversely affect our business and the communities in which we operate. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nInformation technology failures and cyber attacks could affect us significantly.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our operations and prepare our financial management and reporting information. If we record inaccurate data or experience infrastructure outages, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected. Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years. If we were to experience an attack and our security measures failed, the potential consequences to our business and the communities in which we operate could be significant.\nRisks Related to the Spin-off\nIn connection with our separation from Occidental, we agreed to indemnify Occidental for certain liabilities, including those related to the operation of our business while it was still owned by Occidental, and Occidental agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, which indemnities may not be adequate.\nPursuant to agreements with Occidental, Occidental agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Occidental for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnity payments that we may be required to provide Occidental may be significant and could adversely impact our business, particularly indemnity payments relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities that Occidental has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Occidental will be sufficient or timely to protect us against the full effect of such liabilities.\nOur Tax Sharing Agreement with Occidental may limit our ability to take certain actions, including strategic transactions, and may require us to indemnify Occidental for significant tax liabilities.\nUnder a tax sharing agreement with Occidental we agreed to take, or refrain from, certain actions to ensure that the Spin-off and certain related transactions qualify for tax-free treatment. The agreement restricts our ability to sell assets outside the ordinary course of business, to issue or sell additional common stock or other securities, or to enter into certain other corporate transactions. For example, for a period of two years after March 24, 2016, the date of Occidental's final disposition of our common stock that it had retained, we may not enter into any transaction that would be reasonably likely to cause us to undergo either a 30% or greater change in the ownership of our voting stock or a 30% or greater change in the ownership (measured by vote or value) of all classes of our stock absent approval of Occidental.\nWe could have significant tax liabilities for periods during which Occidental operated our business.\nWe or one or more of our subsidiaries were included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of Occidental or one or more of its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Spin-off. We will be responsible for any increase in Occidental\u2019s federal or state tax liability for any period in which we or any of our subsidiaries were combined or consolidated with Occidental if such increase results from audit adjustments attributable to our business. Further, if the Spin-off were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant tax liabilities under the Tax Sharing Agreement between Occidental and us.\nThe agreements between us and Occidental were not made on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nThe agreements we entered into with Occidental in connection with the Spin-off, were negotiated while we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental and did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of Occidental. The terms of those agreements may be unfavorable and may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and other obligations between Occidental and us.", "PERMNO": 15029, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CRCQQ"}
