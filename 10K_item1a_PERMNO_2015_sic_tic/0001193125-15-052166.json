Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating To Our Business\nWe Are Significantly Dependent On Our Revenues From BioGlue And Are Subject To A Variety Of Risks Affecting This Product.\nBioGlue\u00ae Surgical Adhesive (\u201cBioGlue\u201d) is a significant source of our revenues. Any of the following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\u2022\nIf BioGlue is the subject of adverse developments with regard to its safety, efficacy, or reimbursement practices, or if our rights to manufacture and market this product are challenged;\n\u2022\nOur U.S. Patent for BioGlue expired in mid-2012, and our patents in most of the rest of the world for BioGlue expired in mid-2013. Competitors may utilize the inventions disclosed in the expired patents in competing products, although any competing product will have to be approved by the appropriate regulatory authority, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), and portions of BioGlue\u2019s manufacturing process are protected by trade secrets; or\n\u2022\nCompetitors have obtained FDA approval for indications in which BioGlue has been used off-label and for which we cannot market BioGlue, which has reduced addressable procedures for BioGlue, and such actions could continue to reduce addressable procedures.\nOur Products And Tissues Are Subject To Many Significant Risks.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices and processing, preservation, and distribution of human tissues have inherent risks. Any of the following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\u2022\nOur products and tissues may be recalled or placed on hold by us, the FDA, or other regulatory bodies. For example, in 2002 the FDA issued an order related to our cardiac patch, vascular, and orthopaedic tissues processed from October of 2001 until August of 2002, and pursuant to that order, we recalled these tissues or placed them on quarantine hold (we no longer process orthopaedic tissues);\n\u2022\nOur medical devices and our tissues, which are not sterile when processed, allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, injury to patients, which has exposed, and could in the future expose us to product and tissue processing liability claims, and such claims could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny and inspections;\n\u2022\nOur manufacturing operations and tissue processing are subject to regulatory scrutiny and inspections, including by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, and these agencies could require us to change or modify our manufacturing operations, processes, and procedures;\n\u2022\nRegulatory agencies could reclassify or reevaluate our clearances and approvals to sell our medical devices and tissue services; and\n\u2022\nAdverse publicity associated with our medical devices or processed tissues or the industries as a whole that our medical devices and processed tissues are a part of could lead to a decreased use of our medical devices or processed tissues and additional regulatory scrutiny or product or tissue processing liability lawsuits.\nAs an example of the inherent risks of our manufacturing of medical devices and tissue processing, in January 2013 we received a warning letter (\u201cWarning Letter\u201d) from the FDA. The Warning Letter followed a Form 483 related to the manufacture of our medical devices and our processing, preservation, and distribution of human tissue (\u201c2012 Form 483\u201d). The 2012 Form 483 followed a routine quality system inspection of our facilities by the FDA in September and October 2012.\nIn February and March 2014 the FDA conducted a re-inspection to review our actions and responses to the Warning Letter and to conduct a quality system inspection. Following this re-inspection, on March 20, 2014 we received a Form 483 from the FDA (\u201c2014 Form 483\u201d). The 2014 Form 483 included observations concerning design and process validations, environmental monitoring, product controls and handling, corrective and preventive actions, and employee training.\nWe responded to the 2014 Form 483 in April 2014 and provided periodic updates to the FDA throughout the remainder of 2014. Communications with the FDA related to these observations have continued, and we have continued to evaluate and\nmodify our procedures as part of our ongoing compliance efforts. The FDA has indicated its intent to conduct a re-inspection of our operations in the first quarter of 2015.\nWe believe that the changes we have implemented, and will implement, will adequately address the FDA\u2019s observations; however, it is possible that such changes will not be satisfactory to the FDA. If the FDA is not satisfied with our changes and progress, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from making additional public statements to more severe sanctions such as fines; injunctions; civil penalties; recalls of our tissues and/or products; operating restrictions; suspension of production; non-approval or withdrawal of approvals or clearances for new products or existing products; and criminal prosecution. The Warning Letter and any further warning letters, recalls, holds, or other negative publicity from the FDA resulting from its inspections, Forms 483, or otherwise may decrease demand for our tissues or products or cause us to write down our inventories or deferred preservation costs and could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, any adverse publicity resulting from an FDA action or a recall or hold could encourage recipients of our medical devices or our tissues to bring lawsuits against us.\nOur Investment In Our Distribution And License And Manufacturing Agreements With Starch Medical, Inc. Is Subject To Significant Risks, And Our Ability To Fully Realize Our Investment Is Dependent On Our Ability To Sell PerClot\u00ae In The U.S.\nOn September 28, 2010 we entered into a worldwide distribution agreement and a license and manufacturing agreement with Starch Medical, Inc. (\u201cSMI\u201d) pursuant to which we distribute and expect to manufacture PerClot. We were also authorized to pursue, obtain, and maintain regulatory approval for PerClot in the U.S. Pursuant to distribution and license agreements, we made additional payments to SMI of $250,000 in 2011, $1.0 million in 2014, and $500,000 in 2015 and will pay contingent amounts of up to $1.0 million to SMI if certain U.S. regulatory and other commercial milestones are achieved. We will also pay royalties on any sales of PerClot we manufacture. In September 2011 we entered into an agreement with SMI for an additional $1.0 million to acquire the technology used to produce the key component in the manufacture of PerClot. We anticipate that we will spend between $5.0 million and $6.0 million in the next several years to obtain U.S. regulatory approval, most of which we expect to be incurred in 2015 and 2016. We will incur additional costs to begin manufacturing PerClot and to begin marketing PerClot in the U.S. Our costs may be greater than anticipated, as the costs to obtain FDA approval, begin manufacturing PerClot, and begin marketing PerClot are estimates, and these costs may ultimately be greater than anticipated.\nIn April 2014 we received 510(k) clearance for a topical version of PerClot (\u201cPerClot Topical\u201d) from the FDA, which allowed us to begin commercialization of PerClot Topical in the U.S. We began shipping PerClot Topical in August 2014, and we are in the initial stages of this product launch.\nWe will not be able to fully realize the benefit of our investment with SMI in future years unless we are able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in the U.S. to distribute the surgical version of PerClot within the timetable anticipated. In March 2014 we received approval of our investigational device exemption (\u201cIDE\u201d) for PerClot from the FDA. This approval allows us to begin the pivotal clinical trial to gain approval to commercialize PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S. Following multiple discussions with the FDA in 2013 and 2014 regarding our investigational study protocol and clinical product labeling, we plan to begin enrollment in the trial in the first half of 2015, and we currently expect to receive a Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) from the FDA during 2017; however, there can be no guarantee that these events will occur as, and when, we expect.\nWe will not be able to sell the surgical version of PerClot in the U.S. in future years unless, and until, we obtain FDA approval. Failure to obtain FDA approval would materially, adversely affect our financial condition, anticipated future revenues, and profitability. There is no guarantee that we will obtain this approval when anticipated, or at all. Estimates regarding the timing of regulatory approval for PerClot are subject to factors beyond our control, and the approval process may be delayed because of unforeseen scheduling difficulties and unfavorable results at various stages in the process. Our approval efforts for PerClot in the U.S. are subject to delays and cost overages, and management may decide to terminate or delay its pursuit of U.S. regulatory approval for PerClot at any time due to changing conditions in our company, in the marketplace, or in the economy in general. If we are unable to obtain FDA approval by October 1, 2017, SMI may terminate our license to apply for FDA approval, and the parties will have to, in good faith, renegotiate our rights to attempt to obtain FDA approval.\nIn addition, once we receive approval, we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to sell PerClot in the U.S., as other competing products may have penetrated the market by that time and have substantial market share or significant market protections due to contracts. Any of these occurrences could materially, adversely affect our future revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nFinally, we are currently engaged in litigation with Medafor, Inc. (\u201cMedafor\u201d) and its parent entity, C. R. Bard, Inc. (\u201cBard\u201d), regarding whether our anticipated sales of PerClot and sales of certain of its derivative products, such as PerClot Topical, in the U.S. violate a Medafor/Bard patent. See also \u201cOur Patent Lawsuit Against Bard et al Will Be Expensive, And If We Lose, We May Be Prohibited From Selling PerClot Or May Have To Pay Substantial Royalties Or Damages When We Sell PerClot\u201d below.\nOur Patent Lawsuit Against Bard et al Will Be Expensive, And If We Lose, We May Be Prohibited From Selling PerClot Or May Have To Pay Substantial Royalties Or Damages When We Sell PerClot.\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Form 10-K we are engaged in litigation with Bard and certain of its subsidiaries related to PerClot and Bard\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,060,461 (the \u201c\u2018461 Patent\u201d). We expect that this litigation will be protracted and will result in significant costs during 2015. We do not believe that PerClot infringes the \u2018461 Patent.\nIf we obtain FDA approval, but are found by a court to have infringed Bard\u2019s or another third-party\u2019s patent rights, we may ultimately not be able to sell PerClot in the U.S., or we may have to pay a material license fee that may not allow us to fully realize the benefit of our investment in PerClot.\nIn 2013 we entered into an indemnification agreement with SMI (\u201cIndemnification Agreement\u201d) whereby certain of the royalties and a portion of the milestone payments that we would otherwise be required to pay to SMI under our license agreement can be offset by legal fees and certain types of damages we might pay associated with this patent litigation. However, the availability of these monies and the timing of these offsets will not match the timing of the related legal expenses and damages we have incurred and may incur in the future. Even with the benefits of the Indemnification Agreement, any of the occurrences discussed above could materially, adversely affect our future revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur Investments In Our Distribution Agreements With Hancock Jaffe Laboratories, Inc. And Genesee Biomedical, Inc. Are Subject To Significant Risks, And Our Ability To Fully Realize Our Investments Is Dependent On Our Ability To Sell ProCol\u00ae and PhotoFixTM In The U.S.\nIn March 2014 we acquired the exclusive worldwide distribution rights for ProCol Vascular Bioprosthesis (\u201cProCol\u201d) from Hancock Jaffe Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cHancock Jaffe\u201d). We also acquired the option to purchase the ProCol product line from Hancock Jaffe beginning in March 2016. We began limited distribution of ProCol in the second quarter of 2014.\nIn August 2014 we acquired the exclusive worldwide distribution rights for PhotoFix from Genesee BioMedical, Inc. (\u201cGenesee\u201d). We also acquired the option to purchase the PhotoFix product line from Genesee beginning in March 2015. We anticipate beginning distribution of PhotoFix in the first quarter of 2015.\nBoth ProCol and PhotoFix are new products in our portfolio, and we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to distribute one or both of them in the U.S. due to our inability to effectively penetrate the market for these products or competing products penetrating the market and gaining substantial market share or securing significant market protections due to contracts. With respect to both ProCol and PhotoFix, we will be reliant, at least initially, on Hancock Jaffe and Genesee to produce quality products in the quantities we and our customers require. If Hancock Jaffe and/or Genesee experience supply or production challenges, their products are subject to recall or other quality action, their business operations and/or their facilities that make the products are shut down temporarily or permanently, whether by government order, natural disaster, or otherwise, there may not be sufficient product to enable us to meet demand. Any of these occurrences or actions could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, cash flows, and the value of our options to acquire the respective product lines.\nReclassification By The FDA Of CryoValve\u00ae SGPV Would Result In Significant Risks And May Make It Commercially Infeasible To Continue Processing The CryoValve SGPV.\nIn October 2014 the FDA convened an advisory committee meeting to consider the FDA\u2019s recommendation to classify more than minimally manipulated (\u201cMMM\u201d) allograft heart valves from an unclassified medical device to a class III medical device. The class of MMM allograft heart valves includes our CryoValve SG pulmonary heart valve (\u201cCryoValve SGPV.\u201d) At the meeting, a majority of the advisory committee panel recommended to the FDA that MMM allograft heart valves should be classified as a Class III product. We expect that the FDA will issue a proposal for classification of MMM allograft heart valves, which will be subject to a public comment period before finalization. After publication of the reclassification rule, we expect to have thirty months to submit for a PMA, after which the FDA will determine if, and for how long, we may continue to provide these tissues to customers.\nWe currently plan to continue to process and ship our CryoValve SGPV tissues. However, if the FDA ultimately classifies our CryoValve SGPV as a class III medical device, we anticipate requesting a meeting with the FDA to determine the specific requirements to file for and obtain a PMA, and we will determine an appropriate course of action in light of those requirements. If there are delays in obtaining the PMA or if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the PMA, the costs associated with obtaining such a PMA and/or the potential impact upon our tissue revenues, could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows in future periods. In addition, we could decide that the requirements for obtaining a PMA make continued processing of the CryoValve SGPV infeasible, necessitating that we discontinue it.\nWe Continue To Evaluate Expansion Through Acquisitions, Licenses, Investments, And Other Distribution Arrangements In Other Companies Or Technologies, Which Contain Significant Risks.\nOne of our business strategies is to acquire companies, divisions, technologies, products, and rights through licenses, distribution agreements, investments, and outright acquisitions to grow our business. In connection with one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022\nIssue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 value;\n\u2022\nUse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022\nIncur debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay;\n\u2022\nStructure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;\n\u2022\nBe unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales;\n\u2022\nBe unable to integrate, upgrade, or replace the purchasing, accounting, financial, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll, and regulatory compliance of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nBe unable to secure the services of key employees related to the acquisition; or\n\u2022\nBe unable to succeed in the marketplace with the acquisition.\nAny of these items could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, and profitability. Business acquisitions also involve the risk of unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business, which could be material. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could materially, adversely affect our business if we are unable to recover our initial investment, which could include the cost of acquiring licenses or distribution rights, acquiring products, purchasing initial inventory, or investments in early stage companies. Inability to recover our investment, or any write off of such investment, associated goodwill, or assets, may materially, adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nAlthough We May Receive Additional Cash In The Future Related To Medafor\u2019s Earnout And Release Of Escrow Funds Related To Bard\u2019s Acquisition of Medafor, It Is Possible That We May Not Receive Any Additional Monies, Or That The Amount Of Additional Monies Received Could Be Significantly Less Than We Anticipate.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we received an initial payment of approximately $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 for our shares of Medafor common stock due to Bard\u2019s acquisition of Medafor and received an additional payment of $530,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the release of funds in escrow. Based on information provided by Medafor as part of its September 24, 2013 Proxy Statement (\u201cMedafor Proxy\u201d), we believe that we could receive additional payments totaling up to an additional $7.9 million upon the final release of funds held in escrow and the satisfaction of certain contingent milestones, measurable through June 2015.\nWe estimate that we could receive additional payments of up to $987,000 in the second quarter of 2015, and up to $168,000 in 2017 related to escrow releases, and that additional amounts of up to $6.7 million could be paid to us in either the second or third quarter of 2015 based on an earnout of net sales of Medafor. We estimate that the amount we could receive under this earnout could range from zero to $7.9 million, depending on Medafor net sales during the period from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015.\nHowever, we do not have any control over, or visibility regarding, any claims that may have been or will be made against the escrow, whether these escrow amounts will be released, whether Medafor products will meet the sales requirements that would generate the earnout amounts, or whether any setoffs will occur. Additionally, we may not be aware of any of these issues until we are scheduled to receive payments, if any, because of our lack of visibility into what may have\noccurred. As a result, the amount of additional monies that could be paid to us may be significantly less than the amounts we have estimated we may receive based on information provided in the Medafor Proxy.\nThe Receipt Of Impaired Materials Or Supplies That Do Not Meet Our Standards, The Recall Of Materials Or Supplies By Our Vendors Or Suppliers, Supplier Financial Or Operational Challenges, Lack Of Alternative Suppliers, Or Our Inability To Obtain Materials And Supplies Could Materially, Adversely Affect Our Business.\nThe materials and supplies used in our medical device manufacturing and our processing of tissue are subject to stringent quality standards and requirements, and many of these materials and supplies are subject to regulatory oversight and action. If materials or supplies used in our processes fail to meet these standards and requirements or are subject to recall or other quality action, the likely outcome would be the rejection or recall of our processed tissue or devices and/or the immediate expense of the costs of the manufacturing or preservation. In addition, if these materials and supplies are recalled or the suppliers and/or their facilities that make them are shut down temporarily or permanently, whether by government order, natural disaster, or otherwise, there may not be sufficient materials or supplies available for purchase to allow us to manufacture our products or process our tissues. Any of these occurrences or actions could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nNot Having Alternative Or Multiple Vendors For Key Materials, Supplies, Or Services Could Materially, Adversely Affect Our Business.\nCertain of the materials, supplies, and services that are crucial to our medical device manufacturing or our processing of tissue are sourced from a single vendor. As a result, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with those vendors is limited, and if those vendors experience operational, financial, or regulatory difficulties, or those vendors and/or their facilities cease operations temporarily or permanently, we could be forced to cease production of devices or processing of tissue until the vendor resumes operations or an alternative vendor could be identified and qualified, or we could be forced to purchase alternative materials, supplies, or services with unfavorable terms due to diminished bargaining power. Any of these occurrences or actions could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nHealthcare Policy Changes, Including Recent Federal Legislation To Reform The U.S. Healthcare System, May Materially, Adversely Affect Our Business.\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payors to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the fees we are able to charge for our services, prices we are able to charge for our products, and/or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products or services and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products and services.\nOur Sales Are Affected By Challenging Domestic And International Economic Conditions And Their Constraining Effect On Hospital Budgets, And Demand For Our Products And Tissues Could Decrease In The Future, Which Could Materially, Adversely Affect Our Business.\nThe demand for certain of our products and tissues has fluctuated recently and may continue to fluctuate. In challenging economic environments, hospitals attempt to control costs by reducing spending on consumable and capital items, which can result in reduced demand for some of our products and services. If economic conditions worsen, if changes occur in healthcare policies that force or encourage our customers to limit their use of our products and tissues, or if new competitive products or tissues are introduced, demand for our products or tissues could decrease in the future. If demand for our products or tissues decreases significantly in the future, our revenues, profitability, and cash flows would likely decrease, possibly materially. In addition, the manufacturing throughput of our products and the processing throughput of our tissues would necessarily decrease, which would likely adversely impact our margins and, therefore, our profitability, possibly materially. Further, if demand for our products and/or tissues materially decreases in the future, we may not be able to ship our products and/or tissues before they expire, which would cause us to write down our inventories and/or deferred preservation costs.\nOur sales may also be affected by challenging economic conditions in countries around the world, in addition to the U.S., particularly in countries where we have significant BioGlue sales or where BioGlue is still in a growth phase. These factors could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, and profitability.\nKey Growth Vectors May Not Generate The Anticipated Benefits.\nOur strategic plan is focused on four growth vectors which are expected to drive our business expansion in the near term. These growth vectors and their key elements are described below:\n\u2022\nNew Products - Drive growth through the rollout of the Company\u2019s new products including ProCol, PerClot, and PhotoFixTM.\n\u2022\nNew Indications - Broaden the reach of the Company\u2019s flagship products, including BioGlue and PerClot, with new and expanded approvals and indications.\n\u2022\nGlobal Expansion - Expand the Company\u2019s current products and services into new markets, including emerging markets, and accelerate growth by developing new direct sales territories overseas.\n\u2022\nBusiness Development - Selectively pursue potential acquisition, licensing, or distribution rights of companies or technologies that complement CryoLife\u2019s existing products, services, and infrastructure.\nAlthough management continues to implement these strategies, we cannot be certain that they will ultimately drive business expansion and enhance shareholder value.\nUncertainties Related To Patents And Protection Of Proprietary Technology May Adversely Impact The Value Of Our Intellectual Property Or May Result In Our Payment Of Significant Monetary Damages And/Or Royalty Payments, Negatively Impacting Our Ability To Sell Current Or Future Products, Or Prohibit Us From Enforcing Our Patent And Other Proprietary Technology Rights Against Others.\nWe own several patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to our technologies, which we believe provide us with important competitive advantages. In addition, we have certain proprietary technologies and methods that provide us with important competitive advantages. We cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will issue as patents or that no one will challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent that we own. We also cannot be certain that if anyone does make such a challenge, we will be able to successfully defend that challenge. We may have to incur substantial litigation costs to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent or to protect our proprietary technologies and methods. Furthermore, competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies or design around the patented aspects of such technologies. In addition, our technologies or products or services could infringe patents or other rights owned by others, or others could infringe our patents. If we are forced to defend ourselves in a patent infringement case, the costs of such defense could be expensive, and if we were to lose or decide to settle the lawsuit, the costs of the settlement or amount awarded by a court could be expensive. For example, in 2012 we settled a patent infringement case with CardioFocus, Inc. (\u201cCardioFocus\u201d) related to technology we acquired from Cardiogenesis. The settlement of that patent infringement action required a payment to CardioFocus of $4.5 million. Should we be forced to sue a potential infringer, if we are unsuccessful in prohibiting infringements of our patents, should the validity of our patents be successfully challenged by others, or if we are sued by another party for alleged infringement (whether we ultimately prevail or not), our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows could be materially, adversely affected. See also, \u201cOur Patent Lawsuit Against Bard et al Will Be Expensive, And If We Lose, We May Be Prohibited From Selling PerClot Or May Have To Pay Substantial Royalties Or Damages When We Sell PerClot.\u201d\nIntense Competition May Impact Our Ability To Operate Profitably.\nWe face competition from other companies engaged in the following lines of business:\n\u2022\nThe marketing of mechanical, synthetic, and animal-based tissue valves for implantation;\n\u2022\nThe marketing of surgical adhesives, surgical sealants, and hemostatic agents;\n\u2022\nThe marketing of CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy;\n\u2022\nThe marketing of products addressing dialysis therapies; and\n\u2022\nThe processing and preservation of human tissue.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do and are well established in their markets.\nWe cannot give assurance that our products and tissues will be able to compete successfully. In addition, our competitors may gain competitive advantages that may be difficult to overcome. If we fail to compete effectively, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe May Not Be Successful In Obtaining Necessary Clinical Results And Regulatory Approvals For Products And Services In Development, And Our New Products And Services May Not Achieve Market Acceptance.\nOur growth and profitability will depend, in part, upon our ability to complete development of, and successfully introduce, new products and services; however, we cannot guarantee that we will develop commercially acceptable new products and services. We must also expend significant time and resources to obtain the required regulatory approvals. Although we have conducted preclinical studies on certain products and services under development which indicate that such products and services may be effective in a particular application, we cannot be certain that the results we obtain from expanded clinical studies will be consistent with earlier trial results or be sufficient for us to obtain any required regulatory approvals or clearances. We cannot give assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from successfully developing, introducing, and marketing new products and services. We also cannot give assurance that the relevant regulatory agencies will clear or approve these or any new products and services on a timely basis, if ever, or that the new products and services will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance. We may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory approval process if clinical or other data fails to satisfactorily demonstrate compliance with, or if the service or product fails to meet, the regulatory agency\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy, and quality. Those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in applicable laws, regulatory agency policies, or the adoption of new regulations. Clinical trials may also be delayed due to the following:\n\u2022\nUnanticipated side effects;\n\u2022\nLack of funding;\n\u2022\nInability to locate or recruit clinical investigators;\n\u2022\nInability to locate, recruit, and qualify sufficient numbers of patients;\n\u2022\nRedesign of clinical trial programs;\n\u2022\nInability to manufacture or acquire sufficient quantities of the product, particular tissue, or any other components required for clinical trials;\n\u2022\nChanges in development focus; and\n\u2022\nDisclosure of trial results by competitors.\nOur ability to complete the development of any of our products and services is subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products and services based on innovative technologies. Such risks include unanticipated technical or other problems, manufacturing or processing difficulties, and the possibility that we have allocated insufficient funds to complete such development. Consequently, we may not be able to successfully introduce and market our products or services which are under development, or we may not be able to do so on a timely basis. These products and services may not meet price or performance objectives and may not prove to be as effective as competing products and services.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the development of a product, service, or application, or if we determine for financial, technical, or other reasons not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval or clearance of any product, service, or application, particularly in instances when we have expended significant capital, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that these efforts will lead to commercially successful services or products. Even the successful commercialization of a new product or service in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing, under-utilized production capacity, and continuing research and development and education costs. The introduction of new products or services may require significant physician training and years of clinical evidence derived from follow-up studies on human patients in order to gain acceptance in the medical community.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for any products or services offered, the scope of the approval may significantly limit the indicated usage for which such products or services may be marketed. The unapproved use of our products or tissues could adversely impact the reputation of our company and our products and services. Products or services marketed pursuant to FDA or foreign oversight or foreign approvals are subject to continuing regulation and periodic inspections. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of devices and biologics is also subject to regulation and may require FDA approval. From time to time, the FDA may modify such regulations, imposing additional or different requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA requirements, which may be ambiguous, we could face civil and criminal enforcement actions, warnings, citations, product recalls or detentions, and other penalties. This could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign governments and regulatory agencies have adopted restrictive laws, regulations, and rules. These include:\n\u2022\nThe National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 or \u201cNOTA\u201d, which prohibits the acquisition or transfer of human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation, but allows for the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of human organs;\n\u2022\nU.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements for prevention of occupational exposure to infectious agents and hazardous chemicals and protection of the environment, all of which affect our manufacturing operations and tissue processing ; and\n\u2022\nEuropean Union directives, called the EUCTD, which require that countries in the European Economic Area take responsibility for regulating tissues and cells through a Competent Authority.\nAny of these laws, regulations, and rules could change, or the U.S. or foreign governments and regulatory agencies could adopt more restrictive laws or regulations in the future that could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nThe Success Of Many Of Our Products And Tissues Depends Upon Strong Relationships With Physicians.\nIf we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians, many of our products and tissues may not be developed and marketed to appropriately meet the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products and tissues. The research, development, marketing, and sales of many of our new and improved products and tissues are dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and tissues and their marketing. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product consultants, and public speakers.\nCertain states have begun to regulate interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals. There are existing laws and regulations that govern interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals. For example, in 2014 we began disclosing payments made to physicians for meals or other services to the Department of Health and Human Services. These existing laws and regulations currently impact our ability to maintain strong relationships with physicians and may, in the future, further impact our relationships with physicians. If we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and do not continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur Existing Insurance Policies May Not Be Sufficient, And We May Be Unable To Obtain Insurance In The Future.\nAlthough we have significant insurance for products, tissues, securities, and property, it is possible that:\n\u2022\nWe could be exposed to product liability, tissue processing, and security claims greater than the amount that we have insured;\n\u2022\nBecause our insurance is a claims-made policy, we may be unable to obtain future insurance policies in an amount sufficient to cover our anticipated claims at a reasonable cost or at all; or\n\u2022\nBecause we are not insured against all potential losses, national disasters or other catastrophes could adversely impact our business.\nOur products and tissues allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, injury to patients using our products or tissues, and we have been, and may be, exposed to product and tissue processing liability claims. We maintain claims-made insurance policies to mitigate our financial exposure to product and tissue processing liability claims. Claims-made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect. In addition, our product and tissue processing liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages.\nIf we are unsuccessful in arranging acceptable settlements of future product or tissue processing liability claims or future securities class action or derivative claims, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage and liquid assets to meet these obligations. If we are unable to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage in the future, we may be subject to additional future exposure from product or tissue processing liability or securities claims. Additionally, if one or more claims with respect to which we may become, in the future, a defendant should result in a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff(s), such verdict(s) could exceed our available insurance coverage and liquid assets. If we are unable to meet required future cash\npayments to resolve any outstanding or any future claims, this will materially, adversely affect our financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Further, although we have an estimated reserve for our unreported product and tissue processing liability claims for which we do expect that we will obtain recovery under our insurance policies, these costs could exceed our current estimates. In addition, insurance rates could be significantly higher than in the past, and insurers may provide less coverage than we have estimated or expected. Finally, our facilities could be materially damaged by tornadoes, flooding, other natural disasters, or catastrophic circumstances, for which we are not fully covered by business interruption and disaster insurance, and, even with such coverage, we could suffer substantial losses in our operational capacity, along with a potential adverse impact on our customers and opportunity costs for which our insurance would not compensate us.\nAny of these events could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf We Are Not Successful In Expanding Our Business Activities In International Markets, It Could Have a Material, Adverse Impact On Our Revenues, Financial Condition, Profitability, and Cash Flows.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks we face in the U.S., including:\n\u2022\nDifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including foreign distributor relationships and developing direct sales operations in selected territories;\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nLonger accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries and additional cost of collection of those receivables;\n\u2022\nMore limited protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022\nChanges in currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the British Pound and Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar;\n\u2022\nAdverse economic or political changes;\n\u2022\nPotential trade restrictions, exchange controls, and import and export licensing requirements including tariffs; and\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures.\nOur failure to adequately address these risks could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nConsolidation In The Healthcare Industry Could Continue To Result In Demands For Price Concessions, Limits On The Use Of Our Products And Tissues, And Limitations On Our Ability To Sell To Certain Of Our Significant Market Segments.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade, and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators, and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, including healthcare providers. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and limitations on our ability to sell to important market segments, as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices for our products and fees charged for our tissues, which could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur Current Plans To Continue To Pay A Quarterly Cash Dividend May Change.\nWe initiated the payment of a quarterly cash dividend during the third quarter of 2012 and increased the amount of this dividend in 2013 and again in 2014. Although we anticipate the continued payment of a cash dividend to our shareholders in future quarters, the projected timing and amount of any future dividend payments are subject to change based on a variety of factors, including: management\u2019s assessment of our overall needs at the time; our ability to generate current and sustained future earnings and cash flows; and financial requirements, including the requirements of our credit agreement.\nManagement must determine the proper allocation of available resources among operating needs, capital expenditures, research and development spending, acquisitions or other investments in our business, stock repurchases, dividends, and other needs. Our credit agreement imposes limits on our ability to declare cash dividends, including that we may only make dividend payments if, on the date of the dividend payment, no default or event of default under the agreement has occurred and is continuing, and that we are in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in the agreement, including maintenance of certain liquidity requirements. Our total annual dividend may vary from current expectations based on management decisions regarding the timing and per share value of any future cash dividends, or may be discontinued at any time, due to any of the factors described above, or other factors, as well as due to changes to the number of shares outstanding.\nWe Are Dependent On The Availability Of Sufficient Quantities Of Tissue From Human Donors.\nThe success of our tissue preservation services depends upon, among other factors, the availability of sufficient quantities of tissue from human donors. We rely primarily upon the efforts of third-party procurement organizations, tissue banks, most of which are not-for-profit, and others to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue. If the supply of donated human tissue is materially reduced, this would restrict our growth and could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nContinued Fluctuation Of Foreign Currencies Relative To The U.S. Dollar Could Materially, Adversely Affect Our Business.\nThe majority of our foreign product and tissue processing revenues are denominated in British Pounds and Euros and, as such, are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. In addition, a portion of our dollar-denominated product sales are made to customers in other countries who must convert local currencies into U.S. Dollars in order to purchase these products. We also have balances, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accruals that are denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign currency transactions and balances are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates of British Pounds and Euros or other local currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar could materially reduce our future revenues as compared to the comparable prior periods. Should this occur, it could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur Credit Facility Limits Our Ability To Pursue Significant Acquisitions And Also May Limit Our Ability To Borrow.\nOur credit facility, which was extended in 2014 to September 26, 2019, prohibits mergers and acquisitions other than certain permitted acquisitions along with certain affirmative covenants that we must satisfy before we can borrow or enter into a permitted acquisition. Permitted acquisitions include certain stock acquisitions and non-hostile acquisitions that have been approved by the Board of Directors and/or the stockholders of the target company if, after giving effect to the acquisition, there is no event of default under the credit facility and there is still at least $1.5 million available to be borrowed under the credit facility. The total consideration that we pay, or are obligated to pay, for all acquisitions consummated during the term of the credit facility, less the portion of any such consideration funded by the issuance of common or preferred stock, may not exceed an aggregate of $35.0 million. Although our lender has modified the credit facility in the past to allow us to make acquisitions that would not affect this aggregate of $35.0 million, this is no guarantee that they will do so in the future. In addition, we must satisfy specified leverage ratios, and there are also varying levels of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization under the credit facility that we have covenanted to maintain during the term of the credit facility. Failure to satisfy any of these requirements could limit our borrowing ability and materially, adversely affect our liquidity.\nTherefore, as a result, our ability to consummate acquisitions and fully realize our growth strategy may be materially, adversely affected while this credit facility remains in effect. Any credit facility we subsequently enter into may have similar or more stringent restrictions on our ability to pursue significant acquisitions.\nWe Are Dependent On Our Key Personnel.\nOur business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key field personnel and senior management, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our business and future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, processing, marketing, sales, and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. If we lose any key employees, if any of our key employees fail to\nperform adequately, or if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, this could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nRapid Technological Change Could Cause Our Products And Services To Become Obsolete.\nThe technologies underlying our products and services are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. We can give no assurance that others will not develop services, products, or processes with significant advantages over the products, services, and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
