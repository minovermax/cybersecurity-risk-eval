{"cik": "943034", "company": "IMAGE SENSING SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events and can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d or \u201canticipates\u201d or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that might cause these differences include the factors listed below. Although we have attempted to list these factors comprehensively, we wish to caution investors that other factors may prove to be important in the future and may affect our operating results. New factors may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the effect each factor or combination of factors may have on our business.\nWe further caution you not to unduly rely on any forward-looking statements because they reflect our views only as of the date the statements were made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nIf governmental entities elect not to use our products due to budgetary constraints, project delays or other reasons, our revenue may fluctuate severely or be substantially diminished.\nOur products are sold primarily to governmental entities. We expect that we will continue to rely substantially on revenue and royalties from sales of our systems to governmental entities. In addition to normal business risks, it often takes considerable time before governmental initiated projects are developed to the point at which a purchase of our systems would be made, and a purchase of our products also may be subject to a time-consuming approval process. Additionally, governmental budgets and plans may change without warning. Other risks of selling to governmental entities include dependence on appropriations and administrative allocation of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that may reflect political developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, competitive bidding and qualification requirements, performance bond requirements, government shutdowns intense competition for government business and termination of purchase decisions for the convenience of the governmental entity. Substantial delays in purchase decisions by governmental entities, or governmental budgetary constraints, could cause our revenue and income to drop substantially or to fluctuate significantly between fiscal periods.\nA majority of our gross profit has been generated from sales of our Autoscope family of products, and if we do not maintain the market for these products, our business will be harmed.\nHistorically, a majority of our gross profit has been generated from sales of, or royalties from the sales of, our Autoscope products. Gross profit from Autoscope sales accounted for approximately 78% of our gross profit in 2018 and 74% in 2017. We anticipate that gross profit from the sale of Autoscope systems will continue to account for a substantial portion of our gross profit for the foreseeable future. As such, any significant decline in sales of our Autoscope system would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Econolite\u2019s sales volume decreases or if it fails to pay royalties to us in a timely manner or at all, our financial results will suffer.\nWe have agreements with Econolite under which Econolite is the exclusive distributor of the Autoscope video system in the United States, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean. Our current agreements grant Econolite a first refusal right that arises when we make a proposal to Econolite to extend the license to additional products in the United States, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean. In addition, the agreements grant Econolite a first negotiation right that arises when we make a proposal to Econolite to include rights corresponding to Econolite\u2019s rights under our current agreements in countries not in these territories. In exchange for its rights under the agreements, Econolite pays us royalties for sales of the Autoscope video system. Since 2002, a substantial portion of our revenue has consisted of royalties resulting from sales made by Econolite, including 61% in 2018 and 59% in 2017. Econolite\u2019s account receivable represented 42% of our accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 and 77% of our accounts receivable at December 31, 2017. We expect that Econolite will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Any decrease in Econolite\u2019s sales volume could significantly reduce our royalty revenue and adversely impact earnings. A failure by Econolite to make royalty payments to us in a timely manner or at all will harm our financial condition. In addition, we believe sales of our products are a material part of Econolite\u2019s business, and any significant decrease in Econolite\u2019s sales of the other products it sells could harm Econolite, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nAs a result of our continuing review of our business, we may have to undertake further restructuring plans that would require additional charges, including incurring facility exit and restructuring charges.\nWe continue to evaluate our business, which may result in restructuring activities. We may choose to divest certain business operations based on management's assessment of their strategic value to our business, consolidate or close certain facilities or outsource certain functions. Decisions to eliminate or limit certain business operations in the future could involve the expenditure of capital, consumption of management resources, realization of losses, transition and wind-up expenses, reduction in workforce, impairment of assets, facility consolidation and the elimination of revenues along with associated costs, any of which could cause our operating results to decline and may fail to yield the expected benefits. For more information regarding our restructuring and divestiture activities in 2018 and 2017, see the discussion in Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe features and functions in our products have not been as widely utilized as traditional products offered by our competitors, and the failure of our end users to accept the features and functions in our products could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nVideo and radar technologies have not been utilized in the traffic management industry as extensively as other more traditional technologies, mainly in-pavement loop detectors. Our financial success and growth prospects depend on the continued development of the market for advanced technology solutions for traffic detection and management and the acceptance of our current Autoscope video and RTMS radar systems and also future systems we may develop as reliable, cost-effective alternatives to traditional vehicle detection systems. We cannot assure you that we will be able to utilize our technology profitably in other products or markets. If our end users do not continue to increase their acceptance of the features and functions provided by our current systems or other systems we may develop in the future, our business and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur operating costs tend to be fixed, while our revenue tends to be seasonal, thereby resulting in operating results that fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur expense levels are based in part on our product development efforts and our expectations regarding future revenues and, in the short-term, are generally fixed. Our quarterly revenues, however, have varied significantly in the past, with our first quarter historically being the weakest due to weather conditions in parts of North America, Europe and Asia that make roadway construction more difficult. Additionally, our international revenues have a significant large project component, resulting in a varying revenue stream. We expect the seasonality of our revenue and the fixed nature of our operating costs to continue in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. As a result, if anticipated revenues in any quarter do not occur or are delayed, our operating results for the quarter would be disproportionately affected. Operating results also may fluctuate due to factors such as the demand for our products; product life cycle; the development, introduction and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors; changes in the mix of distribution channels through which our products are offered; changes in the level of operating expenses; end user order deferrals in anticipation of new products; competitive conditions in the industry; and economic conditions generally. No assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nIncreased competition may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain end users. If we are unsuccessful in developing new applications and product enhancements, our products may become noncompetitive or obsolete.\nCompetition in ITS is continuing to grow. Some of the companies that may compete with us in the business of developing and implementing traffic control, related security systems and connected vehicles have substantially more financial, technological, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we have. Therefore, they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or end user requirements. If we are unable to compete successfully with these companies, the market share for our products will decrease, and competitive pressures may seriously harm our business.\nAdditionally, the market for vehicle detection is continuously seeking more advanced technological solutions to problems. Technologies such as embedded loop detectors, pressure plates, pneumatic tubes, radars, lasers, magnetometers, acoustics and microwaves that have been used as traffic sensing devices in the past are being enhanced for use in the traffic management industry, and new technologies may be developed. We are aware of several companies that are developing traffic management devices using machine vision technology or other advanced technology. Floating vehicle and/or radio frequency identification (RFID) tagged license plate initiatives are under consideration and may be implemented. We expect to face increasingly competitive product developments, applications and enhancements. New technologies or applications in traffic control systems from other companies or the development of new and emerging technologies and applications, including vehicle-to-vehicle (VTV) communications, mobile applications, and new algorithms or sensor technologies, may provide our end users with alternatives to our products and could render our solutions noncompetitive or obsolete. If we are unable to increase the number of our applications and develop and commercialize product enhancements and applications in a timely and cost-effective manner that respond to changing technology and satisfy the needs of our end users, our business and financial results will suffer.\nWe may not achieve our growth plans for the expansion of our business.\nIn addition to market penetration, our long-term success depends on our ability to expand our business through new product development, mergers and acquisitions, and/or geographic expansion.\nNew product development would require that we maintain our ability to improve existing products, continue to bring innovative products to market in a timely fashion, and adapt products to the needs and standards of current and potential customers. Our products and services may become less competitive or eclipsed by technologies to which we do not have access or which render our solutions obsolete.\nGeographic expansion would be primarily outside of the U.S. and hence will be disproportionately subject to the risks of international operations discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMergers and acquisitions would be accompanied by risks which may include:\n\u25cf difficulties identifying suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable costs;\n\u25cf unavailability of capital to conduct acquisitions;\n\u25cf failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u25cf difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management from the ongoing business;\n\u25cf dilution of existing shareholders and earnings per share;\n\u25cf unanticipated, undisclosed or inaccurately assessed liabilities, legal risks and costs; and\n\u25cf difficulties retaining our key vendors, customers or employees or those of the acquired business.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our exposure to the risks of international operations discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur dependence on third parties for manufacturing and marketing our products may prevent us from meeting customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner.\nWe do not have, and do not intend to develop in the near future, internal capabilities to manufacture our products. We have entered into agreements with Econolite and E.I. Micro to manufacture the Autoscope system, the RTMS radar products and related products for sales in the United States, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean. We work with suppliers, most of whom are overseas, to manufacture the rest of our products. We also need to comply with the European Union\u2019s regulatory RoHS directive restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. If Econolite, E.I. Micro, or our other suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in the future, we may be unable to identify other manufacturers able to meet product and quality demands in a timely manner or at all. Our inability to find suitable manufacturers for our products could result in delays or reductions in product shipments, which in turn may harm our business reputation and results of operations. In addition, we have granted Econolite the exclusive right to market the Autoscope video system and related products in the United States, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean. Consequently, our revenue depends to a significant extent on Econolite\u2019s marketing efforts. Econolite\u2019s inability to effectively market the Autoscope video system, or the disruption or termination of that relationship, could result in reduced revenue and market share for our products.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers may experience difficulty obtaining materials or components for our products, or the cost of materials or components may increase, either of which may prevent us from meeting customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner and could therefore reduce our sales.\nAlthough substantially all of the hardware components incorporated into our products are standard electronics components that are available from multiple sources, we and our third-party manufacturers obtain some of the components from a single source. Some materials or components may become scarce or difficult to obtain in the market or they may increase in price. This could force us or our manufacturers to identify new suppliers, which could increase our costs, affect the quality of materials, reduce our sales and profitability, or harm our customer relations by delaying product deliveries due to increased lead times.\nRegulations related to the use of conflict-free minerals may increase our costs and cause us to incur additional expenses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability of the use by public companies in their products of minerals mined in certain countries and to prevent the sourcing of such \u201cconflict\u201d minerals. As a result, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for public companies who use these minerals in their products, which apply to us. Under the final rules, we are required to conduct due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Although we expect to file the required report on a timely basis, our supply chain is broad-based and complex, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins for all minerals used in our products. To the extent that any information furnished to us by our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate, we could face reputational and enforcement risks. In addition, the conflict mineral rules could reduce the number of suppliers who provide components and products containing conflict-free minerals and thus could disrupt our supply chain or that of our manufacturers and increase the cost of the components used in manufacturing our products and the costs of our products to us. Any increased costs and expenses could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our products are covered by our warranties and, if the cost of fulfilling these warranties exceeds our warranty allowance, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnanticipated warranty and other costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our reputation. We generally provide a two- to five-year warranty on our product sales. These warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products, among other customary warranty provisions. Although we monitor our warranty claims and provide an allowance for estimated warranty costs, unanticipated claims in excess of the allowance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we rely on our third-party manufacturers to fulfill our warranty repair obligations to our customers. Adverse changes in these parties\u2019 abilities to perform these repairs could cause a delay in repairs or require us to source other parties to perform the repairs and could adversely affect impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could adversely affect our reputation.\nWe may face increased competition if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and any efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation.\nOur success depends in large measure on the protection of our proprietary technology rights. We rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and patents, all of which offer only limited protection. We cannot assure you that the scope of these protective measures will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us. We also cannot assure you that we will become aware of all instances in which others develop similar products, duplicate any of our products, or reverse engineer or misappropriate our proprietary technology. If our proprietary technology is misappropriated, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. In addition, we may be the subject of lawsuits by others who claim we violate their intellectual property rights.\nIntellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of our resources, either of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of our intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\nWe have not applied for patent protection in all countries in which we market and sell our products. Consequently, our proprietary rights in the technology underlying our systems in countries other than the U.S. will be protected only to the extent that trade secret, copyright or other non-patent protection is available and to the extent we are able to enforce our rights. The laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology, which could harm our business.\nWe plan to continue introducing new products and technologies and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we initially anticipated, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a range of technologies, products and services. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; the execution of internal and external performance plans; the availability of supplier-produced parts and materials; the performance of suppliers and vendors; achieving cost efficiencies; the validation of innovative technologies; and the level of end user interest in new technologies and products. These factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. We may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when or in what quantities our current or potential end users will have a demand for products currently in development or pending release. Moreover, as new products are announced, sales of current products may decrease as end users delay making purchases until such new products are available. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by product liability and commercial litigation.\nOur products or services may be claimed to cause or contribute to personal injury or property damage to our customers\u2019 employees or facilities. Additionally, we are, at times, involved in commercial disputes with third parties, such as customers, distributors, vendors and others. See Item 3 and Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ensuing claims may arise singularly, in groups of related claims, or in class actions involving multiple claimants. Such claims and litigation are frequently expensive and time-consuming to resolve and may result in substantial liability to us, which liability and related costs and expenses may not be recoverable through insurance or any other forms of reimbursement.\nOur business could be affected by various legal and regulatory compliance risks, including those involving antitrust, environmental, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various legal and regulatory requirements and risks in the U.S. and other countries in which we have facilities or sell our products involving compliance with antitrust, environmental, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act. Although we have internal policies and procedures with the intention of assuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors, agents and licensees involved in our international sales may take actions in violation of such policies. Any future adverse development, ruling or settlement could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe price a segment of our product portfolio at a premium compared to other technologies. As such, we may not be able to quickly respond to emerging low-cost competitors, and our inability to do so could adversely affect revenue and profitability.\nWe price a segment of our product portfolio at a premium as compared to products using less sophisticated technologies. As the technological sophistication of our competitors and the size of the market increase, competing low-cost developers of machine vision products for traffic are likely to emerge and grow stronger. If end users prefer low-cost alternatives over our products, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur revenue could be adversely affected by the emergence of local competitors and local biases in international markets.\nOur experience indicates that local officials that purchase traffic management products in the international markets we serve favor products that are developed and manufactured locally. As local competitors to our products emerge, local biases could erode our revenue in Europe and Asia and adversely affect our sales and revenue in those markets.\nOur failure to predict technological convergence could harm our business and could reduce our sales.\nWithin our product families, we currently utilize only certain detection technologies available in the ITS field. If we fail to predict convergence of technology preferences in the market for ITS, or fail to identify and acquire complementary businesses or products that broaden our current product offerings, we may not capture certain segments of the market, which could harm our business and reduce our sales.\nWe sell our products internationally and are subject to various risks relating to such international activities, which could harm our international sales and profitability.\nSales outside of the United States, including export sales from our U.S. business locations, accounted for approximately 20% of our total revenue in 2018 and 17% of our total revenue in 2017. By doing business in international markets, we are exposed to risks separate and distinct from those we face in our U.S. operations. Our international business may be adversely affected by changing political and economic conditions in foreign countries. Additionally, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect demand for our products or otherwise negatively affect profitability. Engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022 export restrictions and controls relating to technology;\n\u2022 pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022 exposure to the risk of currency value fluctuations where payment for products is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars;\n\u2022 variability in the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated assets, earnings and cash flows;\n\u2022 required compliance with existing and new foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022 laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles;\n\u2022 difficulty of enforcing agreements, including patent and trademarks, and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022 disputes with parties outside of the U.S., which may be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to resolve than disputes with parties located in the U.S.;\n\u2022 political and economic instability, including volatility in the economic environment of the European Union caused by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe;\n\u2022 tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings;\n\u2022 higher danger of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest compared to domestic operations;\n\u2022 difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights.\nOur exposure to each of these risks may increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention. One or more of these factors may harm our business.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results.\nIn June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). In March 2017, the United Kingdom government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other European Union member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. The British government and the European Union have now negotiated a withdrawal agreement, and the European Union has approved that agreement, but the British Parliament has not yet approved it. As a result, there remains considerable uncertainty around the withdrawal. Failure to obtain parliamentary approval of the negotiated withdrawal agreement would mean that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, probably with no agreement (a so-called \"hard Brexit\"). The consequences for the economies of the European Union members and of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union are unknown and unpredictable, especially in the case of a hard Brexit. Depending on the final terms of Brexit, we could face new regulatory costs and challenges and greater volatility in the Pound Sterling and the euro. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations because of Brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. In recent years, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, as well as trade policies and tariffs affecting China. Changes to current policies by the U.S. government could affect our business, including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on U.S. trade relations with China and other countries. The imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing. In addition, other countries may change their own policies on business and foreign investment in companies in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur inability to comply with European and Asian regulatory restrictions over hazardous substances and electronic waste could restrict product sales in those markets and reduce profitability in the future.\nThe European Union\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) directive makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. This directive must be enacted and implemented by individual European Union governments, and certain producers will be financially responsible under the WEEE legislation. This may impose requirements on us, which, if we are unable to meet them, could adversely affect our ability to market our products in European Union countries, and our sales revenues and profitability would suffer as a consequence. In addition, the European Parliament has enacted a directive for the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. This RoHS legislation restricts the use of substances such as mercury, lead, cadmium and hexavalent cadmium. If we are unable to have our products manufactured in compliance with the RoHS directive, we would be unable to market our products in European Union countries, and our revenues and profitability would suffer. In addition, various Asian governments could adopt their own versions of environment-friendly electronic regulations similar to the European directives, RoHS and WEEE. This could require new and unanticipated manufacturing changes, product testing and certification requirements, thereby increasing cost, delaying sales and lowering revenue and profitability.\nOur inability to manage growth effectively could seriously harm our business.\nGrowth and expansion of our business could significantly strain our capital resources as well as the time and abilities of our management personnel. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require continued improvement of our operational, financial and management systems and the successful training, motivation and management of our employees. If we are unable to manage growth successfully, our business and operating results will suffer.\nOur business operations will be severely disrupted if we lose key personnel or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur technology depends upon the knowledge, experience and skills of our key management and scientific and technical personnel. Additionally, our ability to continue technological developments and to market our products, and thereby develop a competitive edge in the marketplace, depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the individuals we need, especially if our business expands and requires us to employ additional personnel. In addition, the loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and ability to expand. The loss of key personnel, or our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel, would harm our business.\nWe may not be successful in integrating any acquired companies into our business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nPart of our business strategy has been to acquire or invest in companies, products or technologies that complement our current products, enhance our market coverage or technical capabilities or offer growth opportunities. For any acquisition, a significant amount of management\u2019s time and financial resources may be required to complete the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. Even with this investment of management time and financial resources, an acquisition may not produce the revenue, earnings or business synergies anticipated. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including the assumption of unanticipated operating problems or legal liabilities; problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses; restrictions on the manner in which we may use purchased companies or assets imposed by acquisition agreements; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets that would reduce future reported earnings (such as goodwill impairments); ensuring acquired companies\u2019 compliance with the requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws and accounting rules; and the potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses. We cannot assure you that any acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or joint ventures will be completed or integrated in a timely manner or achieve anticipated synergies, will be structured or financed in a way that will enhance our business or creditworthiness, or will meet our strategic objectives or otherwise be successful.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for long-lived assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the net carrying value of our long-lived assets (property and equipment, deferred tax assets and other intangible assets) totaled approximately $3.7 million. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant and sustained decline in our stock price, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in our use of assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to our goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nOur stock is thinly traded and our stock price is volatile.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, with 3,813,485 shares of our 5,279,485 outstanding shares held by non-affiliates as of February 28, 2019. Based on the trading history of our common stock and the nature of the market for publicly traded securities of companies in evolving high-tech industries, we believe there are several factors that have caused and are likely to continue to cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. The fluctuations may occur on a day-to-day basis or over a longer period of time. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our stock price include announcements of large orders obtained by us or our competitors, substantial cutbacks in government funding of highway projects or of the potential availability of alternative technologies for use in traffic control and safety, quarterly fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of our competitors, consolidation among our competitors, fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes, and the volatility of the stock market.\nRising interest rates may affect our ability to obtain financing and may cause us to suffer competitive disadvantages.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing in the future. If obtaining financing is adversely affected by rising interest rates or other factors, it could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain financing, which in turn would adversely affect our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions.\nThe transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our cost to obtain financing.\nCentral banks around the world, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) based on observable market transactions. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, but that it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR. Although the full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing, including LIBOR-based loans, and on our financing costs.\nDifficult and volatile conditions in the capital, credit and commodities markets and in the overall economy could continue to adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and we do not know if these conditions will improve in the near future.\nOur financial position, results of operations and cash flows could continue to be adversely affected by difficult conditions and significant volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets and in the overall worldwide economy. Although certain economic conditions in the United States have improved, economic growth has been slow and uneven and may not be sustained. During economic downturns, governmental entities in particular, which constitute most of our end users, reduce or delay their purchase of our products, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business. Any uncertainty about the federal budget in the U.S. could have a negative effect on the U.S. and global economy. The continuing impact that these factors might have on us and our business is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Current economic conditions have accentuated each of these risks and magnified their potential effect on us and our business. The difficult conditions in these markets and the overall economy affect our business in a number of ways. For example:\n\u2022\nAlthough we believe we have sufficient liquidity to run our business, under extreme market conditions, there can be no assurance that financing, if needed, would be available or sufficient, and, in such a case, we may not be able to successfully obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all.\n\u2022\nContinuing market volatility has exerted downward pressure on our stock price, which could make it more difficult or unfavorable for us to raise additional capital in the future.\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions could result in customers in our markets continuing to experience financial difficulties, including limited liquidity and their inability to obtain financing or electing to limit spending because of the economy which may result, for example, in customers\u2019 inability to pay us at all or on a timely basis and in declining tax revenue for our customers that are governmental entities, which in turn could result in decreased sales and earnings for us.\nWe do not know if market conditions or the state of the overall economy will improve in the near future, when improvement will occur or if any improvement will benefit our market segment.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws, Minnesota law and our shareholder rights plan may inhibit a takeover that shareholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Minnesota law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions:\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with any rights, preferences and privileges as it may designate, including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control;\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be increased by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly-created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; and\n\u2022\neliminate cumulative voting rights, therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose.\nSection 302A.671 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (\u201cMBCA\u201d) generally limits the voting rights of a shareholder acquiring a substantial percentage of our voting shares in an attempted takeover or otherwise becoming a substantial shareholder of our company unless holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares and the disinterested shares approve full voting rights for the substantial shareholder. Section 302A.673 of the MBCA generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past four years have owned 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions of the MBCA may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive shareholders of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing market prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, in June 2013, we adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend to our shareholders of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock. In August 2016, our Board of Directors amended the shareholder rights plan to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits to the Company, including those generated by net operating losses. Generally, the shareholder rights plan, as amended, provides that if a person or group acquires 4.99% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to certain exceptions and under certain circumstances, the rights may be exchanged by us for common stock or the holders of the rights, other than the acquiring person or group, could acquire additional shares of our capital stock at a discount of the then current market price. Such exchanges or exercise of rights could cause substantial dilution to a particular acquirer and discourage the acquirer from pursuing the Company. The mere existence of a shareholder rights plan often delays or makes a merger, tender offer or other acquisition more difficult to complete. In March 2018, our Board of Directors recommended amending the shareholder rights plan to extending the term of the shareholder rights plan from June 6, 2018 to June 5, 2020, subject to shareholder approval, to continue to preserve the value of certain deferred tax assets. Our shareholders approved the amendment at the Company's annual meeting of shareholders held in May 2018.\nWe can issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could adversely affect the rights of common shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions, including voting rights, of future series of our preferred stock and to issue such stock without approval from our shareholders. The rights of holders of our common stock may suffer as a result of the rights granted to holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, we could issue preferred stock to prevent a change in control of our Company, depriving common shareholders of an opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price.\nWe do not intend to declare cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any and all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our operating results, earnings, current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, any contractual restrictions and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Therefore, shareholders should not expect to receive dividend income from shares of our common stock.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity risks and we may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nAlthough we take steps to secure our management information systems, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective, and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyberattacks, computer viruses, power loss, or other disruptive events. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers and suppliers, or others who have entrusted us with information.\nActual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants, or in connection with the notifications to employees, suppliers or the general public as part of our notification obligations to the various governmental agencies that govern our business. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of technology used by us to protect transaction or other data. Our reputation, brand and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or other security issues: our operations are disrupted or shut down; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.", "PERMNO": 81624, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "ISNS"}
