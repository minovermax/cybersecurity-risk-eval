RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider all of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC including the material risks and uncertainties that we have identified below. The risks and uncertainties identified below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. If any of the material risks or uncertainties that we face were to occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Please note that additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry.\nWe are a global company that faces competition from a wide range of international and domestic companies, including those that deliver electronic volumetric pumps, elastomeric infuser pumps and other mechanical devices. These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also face competition from companies that are even more specialized than ours with respect to particular markets or product lines. Some of those companies have greater financial and sales and marketing resources than we do or offer products at a lower price point than ours. In addition, former employees may develop products that are competitive with ours or capitalize on customer relationships developed while employed with us, subject to their continuing obligations under confidentiality agreements and other restrictive covenants that may survive their employment. We face competition on the basis of product features, clinical or economic outcomes, product quality, availability, price, services, technological innovation and other factors. In addition, we face changing customer preferences and requirements, changes in the ways health care services are delivered, including the transition of high-acuity care to lower-acuity, and non-acute care settings. Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could suffer.\nThe medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in larger companies with greater access to markets. Health care systems, other health care companies and even retail pharmacies are also consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nConsolidation in the medical industry could have a negative impact with payor and provider relationships and distributor relationships, as we could lose market share as consolidation occurs.\nTechnological developments by others may disrupt our business and negatively impact our revenues.\nThe medical device industry is subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies that provide better features, pricing or clinical outcomes or economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may not be marketable. If competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization for new products than we do, our operations will likely be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by investing in innovation and new product development, which will require substantial resources. Our successful product development will depend on many factors, including our ability to attract strong talent to lead our research and development efforts, properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory concurrence on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner, obtain appropriate\n- 10 -\nintellectual property protection for our products, gain and maintain market acceptance of our products, and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory concurrence or gain market acceptance. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.\nWe are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, principally by the FDA, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the design, development, and manufacturing; testing, , labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage; clinical trials; product safety; establishment registration and device listing; marketing, promotion, and distribution of our products; premarket clearance and approval; record keeping procedures; advertising and promotion; recalls and field safety corrective actions; post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; post-market approval studies; and product import and export.\nIn the U.S., our device products are subject to clearance or approval by FDA under the FFDCA. Before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we must first receive either 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device. To be \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. If the manufacturer is unable to demonstrate substantial equivalence to FDA\u2019s satisfaction, or if there is no available predicate device, then the manufacturer may be required to seek approval through the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain FDA 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products (including the use of our FREEDOM System with therapies not covered by the existing FDA clearance), and the failure to maintain approvals or clearances, or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may:\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources\n\u2022\ninvolve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our products, and\n\u2022\nlimit the proposed uses of our products.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency laws and regulations. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the FDA\u2019s Form 483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities were to conclude that we are not in compliance with any applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could deem our products adulterated or misbranded, and take enforcement action against us. FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Possible enforcement actions include, but are not limited to: temporarily or permanently suspending the sale and/or distribution of such medical products; detaining or seizing all adulterated or misbranded medical products; ordering recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products; refusing to grant pending pre-market approval or 510(k) clearance applications; and/or requiring us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. In addition, the FDA prohibits device manufacturers from promoting their products for uses and indications other than those set forth in the approved product labeling, and failure to comply with this prohibition could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government. The FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The FDA may also recommend prosecution\n- 11 -\nto the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.\nRegulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to continue or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs, or lower than anticipated sales. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business; however, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernmental regulations outside the U.S. have also, and may continue to, become increasingly stringent and common. In the EU, for example, a new MDR was published in 2017 which, when it enters into full force in 2021, will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s EU device approval, ability to distribute products and criminal sanctions. Future foreign governmental laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post market study requirements.\nOur global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations. Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for regulating the UK medical device market. With recent changes in the United Kingdom\u2019s membership with the European Union, the MHRA has and will continue to impose new regulatory obligations becoming effective in 2021 through 2023, for medical device manufacturers. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future.\nProposed changes to the FDA 510(k) clearance pathway and post-market safety monitoring process could adversely affect our ability to offer our new and existing products.\nAs discussed above, the FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development.\nIn fact, the FDA has announced its intention to pursue comprehensive reforms to its current 510(k) clearance pathway, which is used for clearance of low- to moderate-risk devices that are substantially equivalent to a device already on the market, and to its post-market safety monitoring process. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on its plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates, including whether the FDA should publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. The FDA sought input on whether it should consider certain actions, such as whether to sunset certain older devices that were\n- 12 -\nused as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which any proposals, if adopted, could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances, or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.\nIn September 2019, the FDA finalized a guidance to describe an optional \u201csafety and performance based\u201d premarket review pathway for manufacturers of \u201ccertain, well-understood device types\u201d to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway, by demonstrating that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA intends to maintain a list of device types appropriate for the \u201csafety and performance-based pathway\u201d and develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance, where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our competitors seek or currently have received clearance. It is unclear the extent to which such performance standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.\nThese reforms could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining 510(k) clearances or other premarket authorizations for our existing or new devices. Compliance with the new rules could require us to undertake significant additional costs prior to and following commercialization of our products, which may reduce the profitability of those products.\nIn addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require: additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping.\nHealth care policy changes and industry cost-containment measures could result in downward pricing pressure for our products and limit our sales.\nMost of our customers, and those to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the medical devices we manufacture. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs and, more generally, to reform the health care system, could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products or the drugs that they administer, which would put pressure on us to reduce our prices for our products and/or limit our sales. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business depends on an adequate supply of drugs to be administered by our products.\nDemand for our products depends on the availability of drugs to be administered by them. Currently, most of our products require immunoglobulin therapies that rely on blood plasma collection for drugs such as Hizentra\u00ae and Cuvitru\u00ae. Any disruption in the supply of these drugs for any reason, including contamination, could significantly adversely affect our business. The change of any drug indication by the FDA or comparable foreign governmental agencies could also result in decreased demand for our products. In addition, pharmaceutical companies and other competitors have or are developing alternative therapies for disease states that are deliverable without a medical device. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of blood drives have been canceled as community organizations and businesses restrict access to many locations and there are less volunteers resulting in shortages of blood plasma donations. If there is not an adequate supply of drugs requiring administration by medical devices such as those provided by us or alternative therapies are developed, our sales may suffer and/or our products may become obsolete.\nIssues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions, cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.\nQuality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services, and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or\n- 13 -\nsimilar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. We are subject to the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations and similar foreign regulations, which require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearances or approvals, seizure of our products, or delay in clearance or approval of future products.\nThese adverse events could also lead to safety alerts relating to our products or recalls (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nPersonal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or outcome, could not only result in significant legal defense costs, but also have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and ability to attract and retain customers for our products. In some circumstances, adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements.\nInterruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nThe FDA and other U. S. and non-U.S. government agencies regulate our manufacturing operations, which includes product assembly, calibration, pre- and post-assembly quality control inspection and testing, and final packaging for all of our products at our Chester, NY facility. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue that could result in a recall or other inability to sell our products.\nOur products are manufactured and stored at the manufacturing facility in Chester, NY. Products are also stored in storage facilities in the local NY area. Loss or damage to our manufacturing and storage sites due to weather, vandalism, terrorism, a natural disaster, issues in our manufacturing process, equipment failure or other factors, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences, including damage to our relationship with customers. Because of the time required to construct, approve and register a manufacturing facility, we have entered into a supplier agreement with Command, to assist with current production requirements and production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.\nWe take precautions to safeguard our facility and storage site, including acquiring insurance, adopting health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. In addition, regardless of the level of insurance coverage, damage to our facilities may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n- 14 -\nWe may need to substantially change our manufacturing operations in order to expand.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we currently have two 6-month options to extend our current lease of our manufacturing facility, which is also our headquarters, through August 2022. Although we believe this facility is sufficient to meet our current, and foreseeable future production requirements, we are considering various alternatives to expand our manufacturing operations and carry out our business plan. There is no guaranty that any of these alternatives will be realized on favorable terms, or at all. If we do find an appropriate alternative, we may need to expend significant resources to ensure continued regulatory compliance. Changes to our corporate headquarters and/or manufacturing operations could cause us to incur significant expenses and could delay or reduce our ability to manufacture our products for some time. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any such change.\nWe are subject to lawsuits.\nWe have been and may be party to lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes, including patent and product liability claims, whether brought by companies, individuals or governmental authorities. These matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention and resources. Our insurance coverage may not provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if we maintain adequate insurance, claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on our ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. Litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nPatent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We own patents, trade secrets, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of our products. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, both in the U.S. and in other countries. We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Additionally, our intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or we may be unable to enter into license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations.\nThe patent position of a medical device company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.\nAlthough our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies in the event of a breach of confidence. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nFurthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMisappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.\n- 15 -\nWe need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees, including people in technical, marketing, sales, research and quality assurance and regulatory compliance positions. We depend on key management personnel and attracting and retaining other qualified personnel, and our business could be harmed if we lose key management personnel or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel. We do not maintain any \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of any of our employees.\nIn addition, if we expect to grow our operations, it will be necessary for us to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. In particular, we will need to find experienced key employees to lead our research and development and quality assurance and regulatory compliance functions. The failure to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain additional skilled and qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete for such personnel against numerous companies, including larger, more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than we possess. Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell a majority of our products through only a few distributors on whom we depend, and our financial results depend on their purchasing patterns.\nMost of our customers prefer to purchase our products through distributors, rather than directly from us, because of \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d convenience and their ability to ship directly to patients. We sell most of our products through a small number of distributors, two in the U.S. and two outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, these four distributors comprised approximately 69% of our net revenues with one U.S. distributor contributing 51%. Purchasing patterns by these distributors cannot always be predicted and fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year based on, among other things, their expectations of customer demand. Any decline in business with the distributors outside the U.S. could have an adverse impact on our business. If we were unable to sell through the distributors outside the U.S., we would have to find other distributors or broaden our customer base and expand direct relationships with customers. Other distributors may not be available or may not agree to arrangements that are commercially reasonable. In the U.S. we could transition to direct customer purchase; however, customers may not want to purchase directly from us and may decide to purchase competitors\u2019 products through their distributors. Moreover, a transition from distributors to direct customer purchase would be time consuming and costly.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive regulation by governments around the world, and if these regulations are not complied with, existing and future operations may be curtailed, and we could be subject to liability.\nOur devices and our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Europe and other countries, including the FDA. Not only do these regulations present challenges during the regulatory approval process, but after our devices or our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products are approved for new indications and placed in the market, numerous regulatory requirements will apply. These include, but are not limited to QSR, labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or \u201coff label\u201d uses, medical device reporting regulations and post-market surveillance regulations, and laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, advertising, marketing and distribution of medical devices, including our devices and our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers.\nIf our devices are commercialized as part of a drug-delivery combination product we, as the manufacturer of the device component of that combination product, we are subject to unannounced and preapproval inspections by the FDA of our manufacturing facility to determine our compliance with QSR and cGMP.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in an enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authority, which may include any or all of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products or our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products, operating restrictions, partial suspensions or total shutdown of production, refusing our customers\u2019 requests for regulatory approvals of their drug-device combination products or new intended uses, as applicable, refusing our requests for regulatory approval of our devices, withdrawing our customers\u2019 or our regulatory approvals that may be granted and criminal prosecution.\nThe therapeutic efficacy of certain of our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our device is either unproven in humans or has only been proven in limited circumstances, and we may not be able to successfully develop and sell our products in combination with our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products.\n- 16 -\nWhile some of our customers use our products with established, approved drugs, in certain instances, the benefits of those drugs as injectable therapies are either unproven or have only been proven in limited circumstances. Our ability to generate revenue from our products will depend heavily on the successful development, commercialization and sales of drugs included in our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products, which is subject to many potential risks. For example, data developed in clinical trials or following the commercialization of drugs included in our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products may show that such therapies do not prove to be effective treatments for the targets they are being designed to act against (or as effective as other treatments available). In clinical trials or following commercialization, it may be shown that those drugs interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If those drugs are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, the pharmaceutical companies that make those drugs may need to abandon clinical development or discontinue commercial sales or limit clinical development or sales to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. As a result of these and other risks described herein that are inherent in the development and sale of therapeutic agents, pharmaceutical companies may never successfully develop or successfully commercialize their drugs, or the commercialization of their drugs may be abandoned or severely limited, which may limit our profitability with respect to customers with drug-device combination products including those drugs and our device, and we may not be successful in achieving commercial scale production and sales of our injectable drug delivery systems in combination with certain drugs.\nCertain of the injectable therapies being targeted for use with our products are not approved, but are in various phases of clinical development. These injectable therapies may be independently terminated by their makers prior to submission of a regulatory filing or even after regulatory approval, resulting in the cessation of any revenue associated with that contract or program.\nWe work with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are targeting the use of our products with a variety of injectable therapies. Certain of those injectable therapies are not FDA approved, and are in various phases of clinical development. The clinical development of these pipeline therapies can be terminated by their developers at any stage. Furthermore, these pharmaceutical companies could obtain regulatory approval for their injectable therapies, and decide for business reasons not to market and sell their drugs with a drug-device combination product that utilizes our device. Prior investments we have made in manufacturing capacity or research and development will then not result in the generation of revenue that would have previously been anticipated.\nOur commercial success depends upon the attainment of significant market acceptance of drug product candidates to be included in our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our device, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community.\nEven if pharmaceutical companies obtain regulatory approval for their drug product candidates to be included in our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our device, their product candidates may not gain sufficient levels of market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payers, patients or the medical community to make them commercially feasible. Market acceptance of our customers\u2019 product candidates, if they receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\n\u2022\nefficacy and safety of the product candidates;\n\u2022\nclinical indications for which the product candidates are approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, patients and the medical community of the product candidates as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\npotential and perceived advantages of the product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nsafety of the product candidates seen in a broader patient group;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of the product candidates as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\ncost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third party payers and government authorities;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of the pharmaceutical companies\u2019 sales and marketing efforts.\nIf pharmaceutical companies\u2019 candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients or healthcare payers, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue. This may limit our ability to generate anticipated revenue from our prior investments. Moreover, even if we achieve commercial scale production and sales of our injectable drug delivery systems in combination with certain injectable therapies, the makers of such therapies may face indirect competition from companies who develop and market other brand name, biosimilar or generic injectable therapies as well as alternative treatments and delivery methods that compete with our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition and/or cash flows.\n- 17 -\nMost brand name injectable therapies will face future competition from generic or biosimilar therapies, which could significantly reduce their commercial viability.\nBrand name injectable therapies will usually become exposed to competition from generic or biosimilar rivals at some time after their regulatory approval and commercial launch. The average selling price and market share of brand name injectable therapies can be significantly diminished following the introduction of generic or biosimilar competition. These factors may result in our customers using our products with their brand name injectable therapies seeking to withdraw such injectable therapy from the market, or change market tactics in a way that makes the use of our products cost prohibitive. This may result in the termination of supply contracts and the significant loss of revenue.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price, or if we experience other supply difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of raw materials and components for our products. All of the materials and components that go into the manufacturing of our products are sourced from third-party suppliers.\nThe price and supply of materials and components for our products may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of raw materials and components and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply, could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nSome of the components for our products are provided by a single supplier, including our Taiwan-based supplier of molded plastic parts and our U.S.-based supplier of tubing. We also rely on a single supplier to provide needle set subassemblies for our products. We do not have long-term agreements in place with all of these suppliers, although we entered into a long-term agreement with our needle set subassembly supplier in 2020. Due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost.\nAdditionally, the sourcing of our needle sets and tubing products with Command are manufactured in Nicaragua. There could be a delay in providing the products timely due to their climate and international boundaries.\nAdditionally, volatility in our cost of energy, raw materials, components, subassemblies, transportation/freight, and manufacturing and distribution could adversely affect our results of operations. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response to it) could increase our costs, in particular our costs of supply, energy and transportation/freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of oil and natural gas could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).\nOur failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care products may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur devices are purchased principally by specialty pharmacies and ambulatory service providers or hospitals that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of those customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement from third-party payers for our products and the drugs they administer is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by U.S. governmental agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs, and in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies can attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. In addition, as a manufacturer of FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws\n- 18 -\nand regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties. Similar reporting requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers have also been implemented by some states. Failure to comply with these state requirements could result in civil monetary penalties being assessed against us.\nThese laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside the U.S. Actual or alleged violation of these laws by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors could subject us to investigations by the U.S. or foreign governments, significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and damage our reputation.\nOur business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue affecting economies and businesses around the world. We are closely monitoring the\nimpact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it may impact our employees and business operations. While we did not incur significant manufacturing disruptions during 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, customer purchasing patterns and clinical trial activity have been less predictable as well as a slowdown of new patient starts as a result of the pandemic. We may experience disruptions that could severely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our future operating results and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the geographic spread of the pandemic, the severity of the virus, the impact of the virus directly on our employees or those of our suppliers, the duration of the outbreak, governmental actions, travel restrictions and social distancing, business closures or business disruptions (including those impacting our supply chain), delays in clinical trials, the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, the availability of plasma and drugs that are administered by our products, the number of new prescriptions for PIDD and CIDP, purchasing patterns of customers in response to the pandemic, changes to our operations, or whether the United States and additional countries are required to move to complete lock-down status, among others. Our sales representatives are unable to hold in-person meetings with customers and health care providers to discuss our products, which may further impact our sales. As local jurisdictions continue to put restrictions in place, our ability to continue to manufacture our products may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business and manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The health of our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs at our facility cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and intend to follow health and safety guidelines as they evolve. Further, the spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, it has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital, negatively affecting our liquidity. In addition, the recession resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. The ultimate long-term impact of COVID-19 is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nWe may need additional funding in the future, and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development, commercial efforts, or sales efforts.\nProducing and marketing our developed products is costly. Although we believe we currently have adequate capital to fulfill our near-term funding needs, we may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to execute our business plan and help us fund the development and commercialization of new products. We raised approximately $26.6 million from the equity offering in 2020.\n- 19 -\nWe may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings and may also use debt financings or strategic collaboration and licensing arrangements. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience additional dilution; any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could result in high interest expense. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may require us to relinquish certain enumerated rights to our product candidates, processes, technologies, or development projects, or to enter into licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available from the foregoing sources, we may consider additional strategic financing options, or we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate our research or development and/or some of our commercialization efforts.\nWe may experience difficulties resulting from our evolving management structure and executive team.\nWe have made a number of changes to our management structure throughout the organization since July 2018 and have filled a number of these positions while we are actively recruiting to fill others. In January 2021, we appointed an interim CEO to serve during the search process for a CEO. Although, we believe the persons who currently and will serve in these positions are and will be qualified to do so, they may take time to integrate into the organization and with each other, if at all. Many of these persons have or will have had little to no experience with our company prior to joining us, which may result in delays in our ability to implement our business plans. If we are unable to integrate, motivate and retain the services of our new executives and other managers, or if integration takes longer than we expect, it may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nChanges in tax or labor laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could increase our costs and reduce our margins.\nChanges to the tax and labor laws in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Certain changes in tax rates, deductibility of interest, deductibility of executive compensation expense, expensing of capital expenditures, the ability to use certain tax credits, taxation on earnings from international business operations, and the system of taxation (from worldwide to territorial) could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Taxing authorities may audit us from time to time and disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nPrior to the U.S. presidential election, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, the creation of a 10% penalty on certain imports and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income.\nOur manufacturing operations depend on low-cost labor. Recent increases in U.S. minimum wage requirements, as well as those imposed by the state of New York, will increase our costs for employees to support those operations, reduce our margins and negatively impact our profit.\nA downturn in global economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.\nDeterioration in the global economic environment, particularly in countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may cause decreased demand for our products and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. A weakening of economic conditions in the U.S. and/or abroad may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nA portion of our revenues is currently, and we expect in the future to be, derived from international operations. Our revenues from sales outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors. If we cannot adequately mitigate foreign currency exchange rates, our revenues and profit may suffer.\nOur distribution network and other operations outside the U.S. subject us to certain risks.\nApproximately 14% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 came from our operations outside the U.S., and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets. Our foreign operations subject us to certain risks, including, among\n- 20 -\nothers, the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange, uncertainties with respect to local economic and political conditions, competition from local companies, trade protectionism and restrictions on the transfer of goods across borders, U.S. diplomatic and trade relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate, foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements, local product preferences and product requirements, longer payment terms for accounts receivable than we experience in the U.S., difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations, changes to international trade agreements and treaties, changes in tax laws, weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and import or export licensing requirements.\nBrexit may impact our business in the United Kingdom.\nOne of our two most significant international distributors is located in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), and the other is in Finland, a member of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). The June 2016 referendum result in the UK to exit the EU (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), and the subsequent commencement of the official withdrawal process by the UK government in March 2017, has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the UK and the EU. On January 31, 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU. Under the withdrawal agreement agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020 (the \u201cTransition Period\u201d) during which EU rules continued to apply. During the Transition Period, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued in relation to the future customs and trading relationship between the UK and the EU following the expiration of the Transition Period. Due to the current COVID-19 global pandemic, negotiations between the UK and the EU scheduled have either been postponed or occurred in a reduced forum via video conference. However, on December 24, 2020, the negotiators from the EU and UK reached an agreement on a new partnership. This agreement sets out the rules that apply between the EU and the UK as of January 1, 2021. It is possible that the withdrawal could, among other things, affect the legal and regulatory environments to which our business and the businesses of our distributors are subject, impact trade between the UK and the EU and other parties, and create economic and political uncertainty in the region.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. While we do not believe that we have experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities, damage to our reputation, and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. Additionally, such disruptions and security breaches, when there is a risk of patient harm, may require devices changes to fix vulnerabilities and strengthen cybersecurity. Such changes could, in some cases, require reporting to and approval by the FDA prior to implementation, which could cause a delay in the continued marketing of the underlying product that will result in a loss of revenues to us. Furthermore, failure to adhere to good cybersecurity practices with regards to medical devices could result in enforcement action by the FDA including warning letters or other forms of enforcement.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky, and the integration of any newly acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, increases in litigation expenses, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our stock price.\n- 21 -\nFuture material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication or triggering event that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations.\nActions of activist stockholders could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, and joint venture partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nNatural disasters, war and other events could adversely affect our suppliers and customers.\nNatural disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by the U.S. and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. Most of our products are manufactured in Nicaragua, where there is currently civil unrest whose outcome cannot be predicted. This and similar events could increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials, result in decreased demand for our products or adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all the liabilities we may incur.\nWe face the risk of exposure to liability claims if any product that we develop causes injury. Although we carry insurance at levels customary for companies in our industry, such coverage may become unavailable or be inadequate to cover all liabilities we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain such insurance, or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise, or if the amount of any claim against us exceeds the coverage under our policies, we may face significant expenses.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with your interests as a stockholder.\nTwo stockholders, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 27% and 14%, of our outstanding common stock, respectively. An affiliate of Horton Freedom, L.P. currently serves on our Board of Directors. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in exerting influence to pursue or prevent acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future.\n- 22 -\nFuture sales and issuances of shares of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including pursuant to our stock option plan, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity and/or convertible securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner, we determine from time to time. If we sell our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe provide and intend to continue to provide additional equity-based compensation to our employees, directors and consultants. Under our stock option plan, 6,000,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance to our employees, including officers, which number may be increased with the approval of our stockholders. We may issue equity-based compensation outside of our stock option plan as inducement for new employees. If our Board elects to issue additional stock options or other equity-based compensation, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline. Because stock options granted under our stock option plan will generally only be exercised when the exercise price for such option is below the then market value of the common stock, the exercise of such options or the issuance of shares will cause dilution to the book value per share of our common stock and to existing and new investors.\nThere has been volatility in the price of shares of our common stock.\nSince our common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market on October 17, 2019, it has traded between $3.78 per share to $12.42 per share. Our stock price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncement of new products or customers by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ntrading volume on the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n\u2022\nannouncements related to litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; or\n\u2022\nother events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many biotechnology companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of medical device companies could further depress our stock price regardless of our results. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, particularly by our two most significant stockholders, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short time and our stockholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings.\nIf we do not maintain compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq may delist our common stock from trading on its exchange.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market on which our common stock trades has continued listing standards that we must maintain on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. If we fail to meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our common stock. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future, if or when needed.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d, as those terms are defined in the Securities Act. Accordingly, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d and \u201cnon-accelerated filers,\u201d including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation\n- 23 -\nreport on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nOur significant shareholders, officers and directors can sell their stock, which may have a negative effect on our stock price and ability to raise additional capital, and may make it difficult for investors to sell their stock at any price.\n12% and 7% of our outstanding common stock held by two stockholders, respectively, are freely tradeable in the market pursuant to a resale registration statement. These stockholders purchased those shares at prices significantly lower than the price at which our common stock is currently trading. In the event either of these significant stockholders choose to sell a substantial portion of their holdings, the price of our common stock may decline suddenly and sharply. This may make it difficult or impossible for other investors to sell their stock at any price.\nOur officers and directors beneficially own approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. Each individual officer and director may be able to sell up to 1% of our outstanding common stock every ninety (90) days in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, which may have a negative effect on our stock price. In addition, if our officers and directors are selling their stock into the open market, it may make it difficult or impossible for investors to sell their stock at any price.\nThe price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the future issuance and sale of shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock or other equity securities future acquisitions or capital raising activities, or the effect, if any, that such issuances or sales may have on the market price of our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or other equity securities or announcement that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
