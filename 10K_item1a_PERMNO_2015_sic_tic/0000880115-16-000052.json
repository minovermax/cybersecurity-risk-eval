{"cik": "880115", "company": "CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY INC /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThere are many factors that affect our business, some of which are beyond our control. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The nature of our business activities further subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The risks described below are a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business. Other risks are described in \u201cItem 1 - Business\u201d and \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial individually or in the aggregate may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development projects as scheduled. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOil and gas prices are volatile. Since the second half of 2014, there has been a substantial decline in commodity prices, which has significantly affected, and in the future may adversely affect, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, cash flows, access to the capital markets and ability to grow.\nOur revenues, operating results, liquidity, cash flows, profitability and value of proved reserves depend substantially upon the market prices of oil and gas. Since the second half of 2014, commodity prices have declined precipitously as a result of several factors, including increased worldwide supplies, a stronger U.S. dollar, weather factors, strong competition among oil producing countries for market share and decreased demand in emerging markets, such as China. Specifically, WTI prices have declined from a monthly average of $101.68 per barrel in June 2014 to a monthly average of $28.77 per barrel in January 2016. The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has declined from a monthly average of $4.77 per MMBtu in March 2014 to a monthly average of $2.27 per MMBtu in January 2016. These depressed commodity prices adversely affected our 2015 financial condition and results of operations and contributed to a reduction in our anticipated future capital expenditures. In addition, this decline in commodity prices has adversely impacted our estimated proved reserves and resulted in substantial impairments to our oil and natural gas properties during 2015.\nCommodity prices affect our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds under the revolving credit facility and through the capital markets. The amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined at least semi-annually by our lenders taking into account the estimated value of our proved reserves and is subject to periodic redeterminations based on pricing models determined by the lenders at such time. Declines in commodity prices have historically adversely affected the estimated value of our proved reserves and, in turn, the market values used by our lenders in determining our borrowing base. If commodity prices continue to decline in the future, the decline could have further and more severe adverse effects on our reserves and borrowing base.\nThe commodity prices we receive for our oil and gas depend upon factors beyond our control, including among others:\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply of and demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demands;\n\u2022\npipeline constraints and sufficient capacity;\n\u2022\nhurricanes and other weather conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe foreign supply of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe price of oil and gas imports; and\n\u2022\noverall domestic and foreign economic conditions.\nThese factors make it very difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty. Substantially all of our oil and gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices and are not long-term fixed price contracts. Further, oil prices and gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other.\nWe may not be able to replace production with new reserves.\nIn general, the volume of production from an oil and gas property declines as reserves related to that property are depleted. The decline rates depend upon reservoir characteristics. In past years, our oil and gas properties have had steep rates of decline and short estimated productive lives.\nExploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain. We may not be able to economically find, develop or acquire additional reserves. Also, we may not be able to make the necessary capital investments if our cash flows from operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We cannot give assurance that our future exploration, development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs.\nWe require substantial capital expenditures to conduct our operations and replace our production, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms necessary to fund our planned capital expenditures.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires us to spend substantial amounts of capital for exploration and development activities. Low product price environments such as the downturn in oil prices that we are currently experiencing, as well as operating difficulties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our revenues and cash flows from operating activities to decrease and may limit our ability to internally fund our exploration and development activities. After utilizing our available sources of financing, we may be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such capital expenditures. We cannot give assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or that cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures requirements.\nOur limited capital expenditures and drilling program, when coupled with a sustained depression in oil and natural gas prices, will significantly reduce our cash flow and constrain future drilling, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHistorically, we have made substantial capital expenditures for the exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. Due to the continued downturn in commodity prices, we initially suspended drilling operations in 2015 and later reinstituted a limited two-rig drilling program before suspending drilling operations in September 2015 due to another decline in commodity prices. The combination of lower prices and the suspension or reduction of our drilling operations has resulted in reduced production and operating cash flows in 2015. A sustained depression in oil and natural gas prices combined with reduced production and accompanying lower cash flows will adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. Our leverage and the covenants in our debt agreements could negatively impact our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the principal amount of our outstanding consolidated debt was approximately $749.8 million, which included $150 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (the \u201c2019 Senior Notes\u201d), net of unamortized discount. In March 2016, we amended our revolving credit facility and reduced the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments from $450 million to $100 million and entered into a new term loan credit facility providing for the issuance of term loans in the principal amount of $350 million. Following the Refinancing, our pro forma indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was approximately $933 million, consisting of $333.2 million, net of $16.8 million original issue discount, under the term loan credit agreement and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount. The revolving credit facility, the term loan credit agreement and the indenture governing the 2019 Senior Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) each impose significant restrictions on our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, merge, make investments or loans, issue redeemable or preferred stock, pay distributions or dividends, create liens, guarantee other indebtedness and enter into new lines of business.\nOur level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could have important consequences on our business and operations. Among other things, these may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a significant portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on the debt, which will reduce the amount available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the credit ratings assigned by third-party rating agencies, which have in the past downgraded, and may in the future downgrade their ratings of our debt and other obligations due to changes in our debt level or our financial condition;\n\u2022\nlimit our access to the capital markets;\n\u2022\nincrease our borrowing costs and impact the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in our debt agreements, including the addition of more restrictive covenants;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business as covenants and restrictions contained in our existing and possible future debt arrangements may require that we meet certain financial tests and place restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to similar companies in our industry that have less leverage; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nA higher level of debt will increase the risk that we may default on our financial obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance. Our future performance will be affected by oil and gas prices, financial, business, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, governmental and environmental regulations and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016. Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders. If our cash flows are not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance the debt, sell assets or sell shares of our stock on terms that we do not find attractive, if these options are available at all.\nWe cannot be certain that funding will be available to the extent required to fund our development and other operations.\nUntil recently, our primary source of incremental funding for development and operations was our revolving credit facility with a group of banks. During 2015, due to low commodity prices, together with our high levels of indebtedness, we became concerned that, in the absence of a significant improvement in prices, the banks would likely seek to impose significantly tighter restrictions on our ability to access funds under this facility. To address this concern, we entered into the Refinancing transaction in March 2016, allowing us to (1) fully repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and reduce aggregate lender commitments under the facility from $450 million to $100 million, (2) significantly ease financial covenants, and (3) add approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet.\nIf funding under our revolving credit facility becomes unavailable or limited, we may need to seek additional funding in order to finance our development and operations. This additional or replacement financing may not be available as needed, or may be available only in limited amounts and on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms. In such a scenario, we may be unable to implement a drilling plan to replace or increase our reserves, take other measures to enhance our existing business, or pursue business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, and our production, revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, insurance companies and their affiliates. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty, principally with respect to hedging transactions but also insurance contracts and bank lending commitments. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.\nOur hedging transactions could result in financial losses or could reduce our income and cash flow.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into hedging transactions for a portion of our expected oil and gas production. These transactions could result in both realized and unrealized hedging losses. Conversely, if we do not enter into hedging transactions and product prices for our oil and gas production decline significantly during any unhedged production periods, we may realize\na material reduction in our operating margins. The prolonged effects of lower operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves.\nThe extent of our commodity price exposure is related largely to the effectiveness and scope of our derivative transactions. For example, the derivative instruments we utilize are primarily based on NYMEX futures prices, which may differ significantly from the actual crude oil and gas prices we realize in our operations. Furthermore, we have adopted a policy that requires, and the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility also mandate, that we enter into derivative transactions related to only a portion of our expected production volumes and, as a result, we will continue to have direct commodity price exposure on the portion of our production volumes not covered by these derivative transactions.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative transactions. If our actual future production is higher than we estimated, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If our actual future production is lower than the nominal amount that is subject to our derivative instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flows from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution in our profitability and liquidity. As a result of these factors, our derivative activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.\nIn addition, our hedging transactions are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in receiving the full benefit of increases in oil and gas prices as a result of these transactions;\n\u2022\na counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument or may seek bankruptcy protection;\n\u2022\nthere may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received; and\n\u2022\nthe steps we take to monitor our derivative instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved.\nOur proved reserves are estimates and depend on many assumptions. Any material inaccuracies in these assumptions could cause the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves, and our revenues, profitability and cash flows to be materially different from our estimates.\nThe accuracy of estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows from such reserves is a function of the quality of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data and is subject to various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses and other matters. Although we believe that our estimated proved reserves represent reserves that we are reasonably certain to recover, actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from the assumptions and estimates used to determine proved reserves. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves, which in turn could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and the availability of capital resources. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves could require us to impair the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would reduce our earnings and our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe present value of proved reserves will not necessarily equal the current fair market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves. In accordance with reserve reporting requirements of the SEC, we are required to establish economic production for reserves on an average historical price. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those required by the SEC. The timing of both the production and expenses with respect to the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value.\nThe estimated proved reserve information is based upon reserve reports prepared by independent engineers. From time to time, estimates of our reserves are also made by the lenders under the revolving credit facility in establishing the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility and by our engineers for use in developing business plans and making various decisions. Such estimates may vary significantly from those of the independent engineers and have a material effect upon our business decisions and available capital resources.\nOur producing properties are largely concentrated in two major geographic areas, the Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico and the Giddings Area in East Central Texas. Concentrations of reserves in limited geographic areas may disproportionately expose us to operational, regulatory and geological risks.\nOur core producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico and the Giddings Area in East Central Texas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, gas or NGL.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2015, a significant portion of our proved reserves was derived from the Wolfcamp formation in the Delaware Basin and the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations in the Giddings Area. This concentration of assets within a few producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.\nOur proved undeveloped locations are scheduled to be drilled over several years, subjecting us to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of our drilling activities.\nWe have assigned proved undeveloped reserves to certain of our drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year development activities on our existing acreage. These identified locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. At December 31, 2015, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 22% of total estimated proved reserves. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including (1) our ability to timely drill wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; (2) the availability of capital, equipment, services and personnel; (3) seasonal conditions; (4) regulatory and third-party approvals; (5) oil and gas prices; and (6) drilling and completion costs and results. Because of these uncertainties, we may defer drilling on, or never drill, some or all of these potential locations. If we defer drilling more than five years from the date proved undeveloped reserves were first assigned to a drilling location, we may be required under SEC guidelines to downgrade the category of the applicable reserves from proved undeveloped to probable. Any reclassification of reserves from proved undeveloped to probable could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our debt and equity securities. In 2015, we reclassified 9,561 MBOE of reserves from proved undeveloped to probable as a result of this five-year development rule.\nWe may reclassify proved undeveloped reserves to unproved due to our inability to commit sufficient capital within the required five-year development window, which could adversely affect the value of our properties.\nThe SEC generally requires that any undrilled location can be classified as a proved undeveloped reserve only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the location is scheduled to be drilled within five years. Our recent reduction of our drilling program in response to depressed oil and natural gas prices is likely to impact our ability to develop proved undeveloped reserves within such five-year period. If we continue our limited drilling plan over a significant period of time or our future access to capital resources is limited, we will also likely further delay our development of our proved undeveloped reserves or ultimately suspend such development which could result in the reclassification of a significant amount of our proved undeveloped reserves as probable or possible reserves. A significant reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves could adversely affect the value of our properties.\nPrice declines may result in impairments of our asset carrying values.\nCommodity prices have a significant impact on the present value of our proved reserves. Accounting rules require us to impair, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in certain situations. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our assets. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our assets, the carrying value may not be recoverable, and an impairment may be required. Any impairment charges we record in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred.\nOur exploration activities subject us to greater risks than development activities.\nGenerally, our oil and gas exploration activities pose a higher economic risk to us than our development activities. Exploration activities involve the drilling of wells in areas where there is little or no known production. Development activities relate to increasing oil or gas production from an area that is known to be productive by drilling additional wells, working over and recompleting existing wells and other production enhancement techniques. Exploration projects are identified through subjective analysis of geological and available geophysical data, including the use of 3-D seismic and other available technology. By\ncomparison, the identification of development prospects is significantly based upon existing production surrounding or adjacent to the proposed drilling site.\nTo the extent we engage in exploration activities, we have a greater risk of drilling dry holes or not finding oil and gas that can be produced economically. The seismic data and other technology we use does not allow us to know with certainty prior to drilling a well whether oil or gas is present or can be produced economically. We cannot assure you that any of our future exploration efforts will be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, it will have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and capital resources.\nDrilling oil and gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control.\nDrilling oil and gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter economically productive oil or gas reservoirs. We may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. The presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment. In addition, we are often uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, which may increase our costs or restrict our activities; and\n\u2022\ncosts of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, tubular materials and equipment and services or crews.\nIf we do not encounter reserves that can be produced economically or if our drilling operations are curtailed, delayed or cancelled, it could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAcquisitions are subject to the risks and uncertainties of evaluating reserves and potential liabilities and may be disruptive and difficult to integrate into our business.\nOur ongoing business strategy includes growing our reserves and drilling inventory through acquisitions. Acquired properties can be subject to significant unknown liabilities. Prior to completing an acquisition, it is generally not feasible to conduct a detailed review of each individual property to be acquired. Even a detailed review or inspection of each property may not reveal all existing or potential liabilities associated with owning or operating the property. Moreover, some potential liabilities, such as environmental liabilities including groundwater contamination, may not be discovered even when a review or inspection is performed.\nOur initial reserve estimates for acquired properties may be inaccurate. Downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, including reserves added through acquisitions, could require us to write-down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would reduce our earnings and our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur failure to integrate acquired properties successfully into our existing business could result in our incurring unanticipated expenses and losses. In addition, we may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions. The scope and cost of these obligations may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition.\nThe process of integrating acquired properties into our existing business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business.\nWe may not be insured against all of the operating hazards to which our business is exposed.\nOur operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and gas, such as windstorms, lightning strikes, blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids (including fluids used in hydraulic fracturing activities), fires, severe weather and pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations, all of which could result in a substantial loss. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. Such insurance may not be adequate to cover losses or liabilities. Also, we cannot give assurance of the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nOur business depends on oil and gas transportation facilities, most of which are owned by others.\nThe marketability of our oil and gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. The unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, maintenance and repair and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and gas.\nFuture shortages of available drilling rigs, equipment and personnel may delay or restrict our operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of drilling rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise with increases in the number of active rigs in service. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel may increase drilling costs or delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and gas, the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition for such facilities and the inability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our production due to shutdowns or curtailments arising from mechanical, operational or weather-related matters, including hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering and transportation systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to shut-in or otherwise curtail production from wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of oil, gas or NGL pipeline or gathering, transportation or processing capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenues from those wells until suitable arrangements were made to market our production.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and the Board does not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. Covenants contained in the revolving credit facility, the term loan credit facility and the Indenture restrict the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nCompetition in all areas of our operations is intense. We experience competition from major and independent oil and gas companies and oil and gas syndicates in bidding for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as in acquiring the equipment, data and labor required to operate and develop such properties. A number of our competitors have financial resources and acquisition,\nexploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies. Competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will depend on our success at selecting and acquiring suitable properties and prospects for future development and exploration activities.\nIn addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price and availability of alternative energy sources could adversely affect our revenues. The market for our oil, gas and NGL production depends on factors beyond our control, including domestic and foreign political conditions, the overall level of supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGL, the price of imports of oil and gas, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall economic conditions.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur success is highly dependent on our senior management. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel is intense. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected.\nWe are primarily controlled by Clayton W. Williams, Jr. and his children\u2019s limited partnership.\nClayton W. Williams, Jr., age 84, beneficially owns, either individually or through his affiliates, 25.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Williams is also Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Williams has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the election of the Board members, and in other facets of our business.\nWCPL, a limited partnership in which Mr. Williams\u2019 adult children are the limited partners, owns an additional 25% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mel G. Riggs, our President, is the sole general partner of WCPL and has the power to vote or direct the voting of the shares held by WCPL. In voting these shares, Mr. Riggs will not be acting in his capacity as an officer and director of the Company and will consider the interests of WCPL and Mr. Williams\u2019 children. They may have interests that differ from the interests of our other shareholders.\nThe retirement, incapacity or death of Mr. Williams, or any change in the power to vote shares beneficially owned by Mr. Williams or held by WCPL, could result in negative market or industry perception and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBy extending credit to our customers, we are exposed to potential economic loss.\nWe sell our oil and gas production to various customers, serve as operator in the drilling, completion and operation of oil and gas wells and enter into derivatives with various counterparties. As appropriate, we obtain letters of credit to secure amounts due from our principal oil and gas purchasers and follow other procedures to monitor credit risk from joint owners and derivatives counterparties. We cannot give assurance that we will not suffer any economic loss related to credit risks in the future.\nCompliance with laws and regulations governing our activities could be costly and could negatively impact production.\nOur oil and gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local agencies. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws.\nAll of the states in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Such states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of certain states also limit the rate at which oil and gas can be produced from our properties.\nThe FERC regulates interstate gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the marketing of gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of such production. Since the mid-1980s, the FERC has issued various orders that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of gas. These orders resulted in a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation services, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales, transportation, storage and other components of the city-gate sales services such pipelines previously performed. These FERC actions were designed to increase competition within all phases of the gas industry. The interstate regulatory framework may enhance our ability to market and transport our gas, although it may also subject us to greater competition and to the more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater associated penalties for violation of such tolerances.\nOur sales of oil and NGL are not presently regulated and are made at market prices. The price we receive from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. The FERC has implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, would index such rate to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with any certainty what effect, if any, these regulations will have on us, but, other factors being equal, the regulations may, over time, tend to increase transportation costs, which may have the effect of reducing wellhead prices for oil and NGL.\nUnder the EP Act 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our gas operations have not been regulated by the FERC under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional entities to FERC annual reporting. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by the FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nOur oil and gas exploration and production and related activities are subject to extensive environmental regulations and to laws that can give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the emission and discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the management, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes, and impose obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances. Liabilities to investigate or remediate contamination, as well as other liabilities concerning hazardous materials or contamination such as claims for personal injury or property damage, may arise at many locations, including properties in which we have an ownership interest but no operational control, properties we formerly owned or operated and sites where our wastes have been treated or disposed of, as well as at properties that we currently own or operate. Such liabilities may arise even where the contamination does not result from any noncompliance with applicable environmental laws regardless of fault. Under a number of environmental laws, such liabilities may also be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Environmental requirements generally have become more stringent in recent years, and compliance with those requirements more expensive.\nWe have incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. Failure to comply with extensive applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties and remediation costs, as well as the issuance of administrative or judicial orders limiting operations or prohibiting certain activities. Some of our properties, including properties in which we have an ownership interest but no operating control, may be affected by environmental contamination that may require investigation or remediation. Some of our operations are located in environmentally sensitive environments, such as coastal waters, wetlands and other protected areas. Some of our operations are in areas particularly susceptible to damage by hurricanes or other destructive storms, which could result in damage to facilities and discharge of pollutants. In addition, claims are sometimes made or threatened against companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production by owners of surface estates, adjoining properties or others alleging damage resulting from environmental contamination and other incidents of operation, and such claims have been asserted against us as well as companies we have acquired. Compliance with, and liabilities for remediation under, these laws and regulations, and liabilities concerning contamination or hazardous materials, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation.\nLegislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (4) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and\ngeophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common stock.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and gas that we produce.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that typically will be established by the states. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities. More recently, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. These changes to the EPA\u2019s GHG emissions reporting rule could result in increased compliance costs.\nThe EPA and other federal agencies have also taken steps to regulate methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. For example, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA\u2019s proposed rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. The BLM also proposed new rules in January 2016 which seek to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands. The proposal would limit venting and flaring of gas, impose leak detection and repair requirements on wellsite equipment and compressors, and also require the installation of new controls on pneumatic pumps, and other activities at the wellsite such as downhole well maintenance and liquids unloading and drilling workovers and completions to reduce leaks of methane. Compliance with these proposed rules will require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, and increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules will also likely require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nIn addition, from time to time Congress has considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emission of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emission detection and control systems, to acquire emission allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Act, the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits. The position limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September of 2012 although the CFTC has stated that it will appeal the District Court\u2019s decision. The CFTC also has finalized other regulations, including critical rulemakings on the definitions of \u201cswap,\u201d \u201csecurity-based swap,\u201d \u201cswap dealer\u201d and \u201cmajor swap participant.\u201d The Act and CFTC rules also will require us in connection with certain derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements (or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements). In addition new regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements although these regulations are not finalized and their application to us is uncertain at this time. Other regulations also remain to be finalized, and the CFTC recently has delayed the compliance dates for various regulations already finalized. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the Act and CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects.\nThe Act also may require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral that could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and potentially increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or other similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the following actions and issued: guidance under the SDWA for hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel; final regulations under the Clean Air Act governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in March 2014 under the Toxic Substances Control Act that would require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing; and proposed rules in April 2015 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule. A final decision has not yet been issued.\nCertain governmental reviews are also underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. In addition, in June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources. The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and a formal review by the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. These ongoing or any future studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nFrom time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, several states, including Texas and New Mexico, where we conduct operations, have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, chemical disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from various sources for use in our operations. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil and gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA terrorist attack, anti-terrorist efforts or other armed conflict could adversely affect our business by decreasing our revenues and increasing our costs.\nA terrorist attack, anti-terrorist efforts or other armed conflict involving the United States may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur or escalate, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a decrease in our revenues. Oil and gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities used for the production, transportation, processing or marketing of oil and gas production are destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.", "PERMNO": 79159, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CWEI"}
