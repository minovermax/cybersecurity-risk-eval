{"cik": "357097", "company": "Fibrocell Science, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the following risks and uncertainties, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties of general applicability and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe need to obtain additional capital to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we will need to curtail and reduce our operations and costs, and modify our business strategy.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents of $29.3 million as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $15.6 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2016. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of such circumstances.\nTo meet our capital needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including but not limited to, equity financings, debt financings, corporate collaborations, partnerships and other strategic transactions and funding opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transaction on acceptable terms or otherwise. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, will result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnership arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will need to curtail and reduce our operations and costs, and modify our business strategy which may require us to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives;\n\u2022\nseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nsell or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u2022\nseek bankruptcy protection which may result in the termination of agreements pursuant to which we license important intellectual property rights including our exclusive collaboration agreements with Intrexon.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, have not generated significant revenue from commercial sales of our products, and have never been profitable. Since 2013, which is when we changed our business strategy to focus on therapeutic indications for azficel-T and on diseases affecting the skin and connective tissue in collaboration with our partner Intrexon, we have reduced sales and marketing efforts of LAVIV. We fulfilled a nominal amount of prescriptions for LAVIV aesthetic procedures in 2014 and 2015 and will continue to do so in 2016. Investment in drug development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations including development of our product candidates and operation of our manufacturing facility. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since we emerged from bankruptcy in September 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported a net loss of $34.5 million, and we had an accumulated deficit of $147.2 million at December 31, 2015.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will continue to be significant if and as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue our research and pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ninitiate additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies or trials for our product candidates, including under our collaboration agreements with Intrexon;\n\u2022\ncontinue or expand our collaborations with Intrexon and our other collaborators;\n\u2022\nfurther develop the manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncontinue to maintain a cGMP manufacturing facility;\n\u2022\nchange or add additional manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nseek to identify and validate additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nmaintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nattract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022\ncreate additional infrastructure to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.\nThe net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not generate significant revenues from product sales and may never be profitable.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for, the manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates. Other than from the sale of LAVIV, we do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future, if ever. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022\ncompleting research and pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseeking and obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates for which we complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndeveloping a sustainable, scalable, reproducible, and transferable manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate (in amount and quality) products and services to support clinical development and the market demand for our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nlaunching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, either by collaborating with a partner or, if launched independently, by establishing a sales force, marketing, sales operations and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\nobtaining market acceptance of our product candidates and cell therapy and gene therapy as viable treatment options;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nimplementing additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed;\n\u2022\nidentifying and validating new product candidates;\n\u2022\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u2022\nmaintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u2022\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to perform clinical trials or other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nWe will seek to raise additional funds in the future, which may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future to help fund our clinical trials, our collaboration efforts with Intrexon and for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such as through our \"at-the-market\" equity program with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced. We may also issue equity as part of license issue fees to our licensors, compensate consultants or settle outstanding payables. Our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share and any additional equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, will result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through corporate collaboration, partnership or other strategic transactions, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, our technologies or future revenue streams or to grant licenses or sell assets on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we cannot raise additional funds, we will have to delay our development activities or cease operations.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe have a limited operating history and our primary business activities consist of pre-clinical development and conducting clinical trials, pursuing our collaborations with Intrexon and commercializing LAVIV. As such, our historical financial data is of limited value in estimating future operating expenses. Our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning the costs of our pre-clinical development, clinical trials and our collaborations with Intrexon, which depend on the success of such activities, and our ability to effectively and efficiently conduct such trials, pre-clinical development and our expectations related to our efforts to achieve FDA approval with respect to our product candidates. Our limited operating history and clinical trial experience make these costs difficult to forecast accurately. We may be unable to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected increase in costs. Further, our fixed manufacturing\ncosts and operating expenses may increase significantly as we expand our operations. Accordingly, a significant increase in costs could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, incur debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets or businesses, or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable collaboration partners or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or shares of our common stock as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional capital for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional capital may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nOur gene-therapy product candidates are based on novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. At the moment, no gene therapy products have been approved in the United States and only one product has been approved in the European Union.\nOur gene-therapy product candidates, including FCX-007 and FCX-013, are based on novel technology. Our future success depends on the successful development of this therapeutic approach. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our gene-therapy product candidates will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and commercial-scale manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical studies or commercializing our gene-therapy products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nIn addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for gene-therapy product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. At the moment, only one gene-therapy product, UniQure\u2019s Glybera, which received marketing authorization in the European Union, or EU, in 2012, has been approved in the Western world, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our gene-therapy product candidates in the United States, the EU or other jurisdictions. Approvals by the EMA and the European Commission may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities\u2019 Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical study, even if the FDA has reviewed the study and approved its initiation. Clinical trial sites in the United States that receive NIH funding for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are required to follow RAC recommendations, or risk losing NIH funding for such research or needing NIH pre-approval before conducting such research. In addition, the\nFDA can put an investigational new drug application, or IND, on clinical hold if the information in an IND is not sufficient to assess the risks in pediatric patients. Before a clinical study can begin at any institution, that institution\u2019s institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will have to review the proposed clinical study to assess the safety of the trial. Moreover, serious adverse events or developments in clinical trials of gene therapy product candidates conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to initiate a clinical hold on our clinical trials or otherwise change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates.\nThese regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.\nThe results seen in pre-clinical studies of our product candidates may not be replicated in humans.\nAlthough we have seen positive results in pre-clinical studies of FCX-007 and FCX-013, we may not see positive\nresults when these and any other product candidates undergo future clinical trials in humans. Pre-clinical studies are not\ndesigned to test the efficacy of a product candidate in humans, but rather to:\n\u2022\ntest short-term safety;\n\u2022\nestablish biological plausibility;\n\u2022\nidentify biologically active dose levels;\n\u2022\nestablish feasibility and reasonable safety of the investigational product's proposed clinical route of administration;\n\u2022\nidentify physiologic parameters that can guide clinical monitoring; and/or\n\u2022\nestablish proof of concept, or the feasibility and rationale for use of an investigational product in the targeted patient population.\nSuccess in pre-clinical studies does not ensure that later studies or any clinical trials will be successful nor does it predict future results. The rate of failure in drug development is quite high, and many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in pre-clinical studies and earlier clinical trials. Product candidates may fail to show desired safety and efficacy when used with human patients. Negative or inconclusive results from any of our ongoing pre-clinical studies could result in delays, modifications, or abandonment of clinical trials and the termination of our development of a product candidate.\nIn September 2015, we received feedback from the FDA relating to our IND for FCX-007. If we are unable to adequately address the FDA\u2019s feedback, we will not be permitted to commence clinical trials of FCX-007, the development of FCX-007 will be further delayed and we will incur additional costs.\nIn September 2015, we received feedback from the FDA relating to our IND application for FCX-007, which required us to delay the initiation of our proposed Phase I/II clinical trial. The FDA\u2019s feedback related to the areas of CMC, toxicology and our proposed Phase I/II clinical trial protocol. Although the prior hybrid pharmacology/toxicology study performed based on the injection of FCX-007 into human skin that was xenografted onto SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice was included in the IND and showed no signs of toxicity, the FDA requested that we execute an additional toxicology-specific study in which FCX-007 will be injected in non-grafted SCID mice. We have initiated this new toxicology study, and we expect to amend the IND in response to the FDA\u2019s feedback and to include data from the new study in the first quarter of 2016. If we are unable to successfully complete the additional toxicology study and adequately address the FDA\u2019s other feedback, we will not be permitted to commence clinical trials, the development of FCX-007 will be further delayed and we will be required to incur additional costs in the development of FCX-007.\nIn previous clinical trials involving viral vectors for gene therapy, some patients experienced serious adverse events, including the development of leukemia due to vector-related insertional oncogenesis. If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates.\nA significant risk in any gene therapy product based on viral vectors is that the vector will insert in or near cancer-causing oncogenes leading to uncontrolled clonal proliferation of mature cancer cells in the patient. For example, in 2003, 20 patients treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in two gene therapy trials using a murine, or mouse-derived, gamma-retroviral vector showed correction of the disease, but the trials were terminated after five patients developed leukemia (four of whom were subsequently cured). The cause of these adverse events was shown to be insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the corrected gene inserts in or near a gene that is important in a critical cellular process like growth or division, and this insertion results in the development of a cancer (often leukemia). Using molecular diagnostic techniques, it was determined that clones from these patients showed retrovirus insertion in proximity to the promoter of the LMO2 proto-oncogene. Earlier generation retroviruses like the one used in these two trials have been shown to preferentially integrate in regulatory regions of genes that control cell growth.\nThese well-publicized adverse events led to the development of new viral vectors, such as lentiviral vectors like the ones we utilize for FCX-007 and FCX-013, with potentially improved safety profiles and also the requirement of enhanced safety monitoring in gene therapy clinical trials, including periodic analyses of the therapy\u2019s genetic insertion sites. Notwithstanding the potential safety improvements of lentiviral vectors, the risk of insertional oncogenesis remains a significant concern for gene therapy and we cannot assure that it will not occur in any of our clinical trials. There is also the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. The FDA has stated that lentiviral vectors possess characteristics that may pose risks of delayed adverse events. If any such adverse events occur, further advancement of our clinical trials could be halted or delayed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience similar delays in the future. If patients are unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse events in cell and gene therapies or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a clinical trial or complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by a variety factors including, among others:\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\ndesign of the study protocol;\n\u2022\nprevalence of the disease/size of the patient population;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\navailability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022\nability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nOur current product candidates are being developed to treat rare diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials and the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. We have estimated that there are approximately 1,100 to 2,500 U.S. patients with RDEB and approximately 40,000 U.S. patients with linear scleroderma over a major joint who exhibit severe joint pain. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nClinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval of our product candidates and harm our business.\nPrior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, that our product candidates are both safe and effective. We will need to demonstrate our product candidates\u2019 efficacy and monitor their safety throughout the process. If our current or future clinical trials are unsuccessful, regulatory approval of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented and our business could be harmed.\nAll of our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. The results of early-stage clinical trials of our product candidates do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate desired safety and efficacy traits despite having successfully progressed through initial clinical testing. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates is promising, this data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other U.S. or foreign regulatory approval. The FDA may also reject any of our completed clinical trials as inadequate to support approval if the study design does not include specific safety monitoring measures. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, FDA officials could reach different conclusions in assessing such data than we do which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, the FDA, other regulatory authorities, our IRB or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time.\nObtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is complex, time consuming and expensive, and the outcomes are uncertain.\nThe process of obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is time consuming, expensive and difficult. Clinical trials are required to establish the safety and efficacy of product candidates. Applications to market product candidates must be submitted to the FDA which must be reviewed for approval and approved by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed and clinical trials, manufacturing, and the marketing of products, if approved, are subject to strict regulatory compliance. The commencement and completion of clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a study or trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocol from an IRB to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective study site;\n\u2022\ndelays in the enrollment of patients;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022\nfailure of our clinical trials and clinical investigators to be in compliance with the FDA\u2019s GCP;\n\u2022\nfailure of our third-party contract research organizations, clinical site organizations or other clinical trial managers, to satisfy their contractual duties, comply with regulations or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\nlack of efficacy during clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues.\nWe do not know whether our clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all, or whether they will provide data necessary to support regulatory approval. Significant delays in clinical trials will impede our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue, and could significantly increase our development costs.\nIn addition, we utilize bovine-sourced materials to manufacture our product candidates. It is possible that future FDA regulations may require us to change the source of the bovine-sourced materials we use in our products or to cease using bovine-sourced materials. If we are required to use alternative materials in our products, and in the event that such alternative materials are available to us, or if we choose to change the materials used in our products in the future, we would need to validate the new manufacturing process and run comparability trials with the reformulated product, which could delay our submission for regulatory approval of our product candidates and negatively impact the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, or if such approvals are limited, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and we will not generate product revenues.\nEven if we comply with all FDA pre-approval regulatory requirements, the FDA may determine that our product candidates are not safe or effective, and we may never obtain regulatory approval for such product candidates. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for some or all of our product candidates, we will have fewer commercial products, if any, and correspondingly lower product revenues, if any. Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, such approval may involve limitations on the indications and conditions of use or marketing claims for our products. Further, later discovery of previously unknown problems or AEs could result in additional regulatory restrictions, including withdrawal of products and addition of warnings or other statements on the product label.\nWith respect to LAVIV, which was approved in June 2011, as part of approval the FDA required us, based on clinical trial data, to conduct a 2,700 patient post-marketing study evaluating the risk of skin cancer in the injection site. This study is required to be completed by the end of 2016. We have been engaged in discussions with the FDA on the design of the post-marketing study, as we believe the original study design, especially the sample size, is no longer consistent with our current emphasis on azficel-T for vocal cord scarring and our decreased involvement with cosmetic applications. The FDA acknowledged that commercial volume since the marketing of LAVIV is inadequate to meet the original enrollment rate proposed but has required submission of actual enrollment data before considering a revision. We have initiated enrollment in the post-marketing study and have submitted the required biannual interim reports to the FDA containing this enrollment data, with the most recent being in January 2016. We continue to be actively engaged in discussions with the FDA about how to fulfill the original post-marketing study sample size requirement in light of the limited population of LAVIV users. Although we believe we will be able to reach an agreement with the FDA on this post-marketing study, to the extent we are unable to complete an acceptable post-marketing study, the FDA may determine to take action against us, including the withdrawal of its approval of LAVIV.\nIn jurisdictions outside the United States, we must receive marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities before commercializing our product candidates. Regulatory approval processes outside the United States generally include requirements and risks similar to, and in many cases in excess of, the risks associated with FDA approval.\nOur failure to comply with extensive governmental regulation may significantly affect our operating results.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for some or all of our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to extensive ongoing requirements by the FDA, as well as by a number of foreign, national, state and local agencies. These regulations will impact many aspects of our operations, including testing, research and development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, quality control, AE reporting, import and export, record keeping, approval, distribution, advertising and promotion of our future products. We must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to an approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. The FDA enforces post-marketing regulatory requirements, including the cGMP requirements, through periodic unannounced inspections. We do not know whether we will pass any future FDA inspections. Failure to pass an inspection could disrupt, delay or shut down our manufacturing operations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nadministrative or judicial enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nchanges to advertising;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nrevocation or suspension of regulatory approvals of products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures or recalls;\n\u2022\ncourt-ordered injunctions;\n\u2022\nimport detentions;\n\u2022\ndelay, interruption or suspension of product manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales; or\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal sanctions.\nThe discovery of previously unknown problems with our products may result in restrictions on the products, including withdrawal from the market. In addition, the FDA may revisit and change its prior determinations with regard to the safety or efficacy of our future products. If the FDA\u2019s position changes, we may be required to change our labeling or cease to\nmanufacture and market our future products. Even prior to any formal regulatory action, we could voluntarily decide to cease the distribution and sale or recall any of our future products if concerns about their safety or efficacy develop.\nIn their regulation of advertising and other promotion, the FDA and the FTC may issue correspondence alleging that some advertising or promotional practices are false, misleading or deceptive. The FDA and FTC are authorized to impose a wide array of sanctions on companies for such advertising and promotion practices, which could result in any of the following:\n\u2022\nincurring substantial expenses, including fines, penalties, legal fees and costs to comply with the FDA\u2019s requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the methods of marketing and selling products;\n\u2022\ntaking FDA mandated corrective action, which may include placing advertisements or sending letters to physicians rescinding previous advertisements or promotions; or\n\u2022\ndisruption in the distribution of products and loss of sales until compliance with the FDA\u2019s position is obtained.\nImproper promotional activities may also lead to investigations by federal or state prosecutors, and result in criminal and civil penalties. If we become subject to any of the above requirements, it could be damaging to our reputation and restrict our ability to sell or market our future products, and our business condition could be adversely affected. We may also incur significant expenses in defending ourselves.\nPhysicians may prescribe pharmaceutical or biologic products for uses that are not described in a product\u2019s labeling or differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. While such \u201coff-label\u201d uses are common and the FDA does not regulate physicians\u2019 choice of treatments, the FDA does restrict a manufacturer\u2019s communications on the subject of off-label use. Companies cannot promote FDA-approved pharmaceutical or biologic products for off-label uses, but under certain limited circumstances they may disseminate to practitioners\u2019 articles published in peer-reviewed journals. To the extent allowed by the FDA, we may disseminate peer-reviewed articles on our future products, if approved, to practitioners. If, however, our activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, the FDA or other regulatory or law enforcement authorities.\nOur sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs, if any in the future, must also comply with applicable requirements of the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the federal anti-kickback law, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veteran\u2019s Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. The distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act.\nDepending on the circumstances, failure to meet post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity.\nWe are subject to significant regulation with respect to the manufacturing of our products.\nComponents of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third party contractors and suppliers must pass inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of FDA approval of our products. In addition, the FDA may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility, including our manufacturing facility, involved with the preparation of LAVIV, or our associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. The FDA also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the FDA may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial\nsales, recalls, market withdrawals, seizures or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our product candidates, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our operations will be adversely impacted.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have obtained FDA orphan designation for FCX-007 and intend to seek orphan drug designation for FCX-013. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. The first company to obtain FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug or access to the biologic.\nBecause the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our product candidates is limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible product candidates, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates that do not have broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug or biologic to treat the same condition which could adversely affect our operations.\nEven though we have obtained orphan drug designation for FCX-007 and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for other product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain regulatory approval for any particular orphan indication, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval until the first product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity period expires. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process, nor does it provide any additional opportunities for review and guidance from the FDA during the review and approval process.\nEven if we were to obtain approval for FCX-007 with the rare pediatric disease designation, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program may no longer be in effect at the time of such approval.\nFCX-007 has received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for the treatment of RDEB. The FDA defines a \"rare pediatric disease\" as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. primarily under the age of 18 years old. Under the FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, upon the approval of a NDA or BLA for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application would be eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA. The Priority Review Voucher may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the Priority Review Voucher Program until September 30, 2016. This program has been subject to criticism, including by the FDA, and it is possible that even if we obtain approval for FCX-007 and qualify for such a Priority Review Voucher, the program may no longer be in effect at the time of approval.\nWe are largely dependent on the future commercial success of our product candidates.\nOur ability to generate revenues and become profitable will depend in large part on the future commercial success of our product candidates. If any product that we commercialize in the future does not gain an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, patients and third parties, we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable. Market acceptance of our products, and any other products that we commercialize, by physicians, patients and third party payors will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nThe efficacy, safety and other potential advantages in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nThe relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nThe availability of adequate coverage or reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other healthcare payors, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nThe prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022\nThe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including generic products;\n\u2022\nThe extent and strength of our third party manufacturer and supplier support;\n\u2022\nThe extent and strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nThe limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA approved labeling; and\n\u2022\nDistribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or to which we agree as part of a mandatory risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or voluntary risk management plan\nFor example, even if our products have been approved by the FDA, physicians and patients may not immediately be receptive to them and may be slow to adopt them. In addition, even though we believe our product candidates have significant advantages to other treatment options, because no head-to-head trials comparing our product candidates to competing products will have been conducted, the prescribing information approved by the FDA would not contain claims that our product is safer or more effective than competitive products. Accordingly, promotion of our products will not reflect any comparative advantages that may exist. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, patients and third party payors, we may not generate meaningful revenues from and we may not become profitable.\nIn order to commercialize any future product candidates, we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve our manufacturing capabilities, which will require significant expenditures and regulatory approval.\nWe currently have limited manufacturing capacity. In order to commercialize any future product candidates, we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity. We are developing enhancements and alternatives to our current manufacturing process. If we have difficulties in increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our capabilities, we will be limited in our ability to manufacture and commercialize our product candidates, if they are approved for marketing; and we may not be able to decrease our manufacturing costs. These difficulties could adversely affect our financial performance and damage our reputation. Even if we are successful in developing such enhancements or finding alternatives to our current process, such manufacturing changes will require additional expenditures, for which we may be required to seek external financing. In addition, our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity or modify our manufacturing processes will be subject to additional FDA review and approval.\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapies may damage public perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates.\nPublic perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapies are unsafe, and gene therapies may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates.\nFuture sales of our products are subject to adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are subject to increasing and intense pressure from political, social, competitive and other sources. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFuture sales of our product candidates, should they receive regulatory approval and be commercialized, are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our product candidates (e.g., for administration of our products to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products.\nPricing and reimbursement for our products and services related to our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors' reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\npressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs; and\n\u2022\nconsolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value.\nOur failure to maintain adequate coverage, pricing, or reimbursement for our products and services related to our products would have an adverse effect on our business, revenues and results of operation, could curtail or eliminate our ability to adequately fund research and development programs for the discovery and commercialization of new products, and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nDrug pricing and other health care costs are under significant scrutiny in the U.S are subject to intense political and societal pressures which we anticipate will continue and escalate on a global basis. As a result, our business and reputation may be harmed, our stock price may be adversely impacted and experience periods of volatility, and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our results of operations may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe focus our research and product development on treatments of diseases affecting the skin, connective tissue and joints. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies or clinical trials may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the U.S. and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nIf any of our approved products were to become the subject of problems related to their efficacy, safety, or otherwise, our business would be seriously harmed.\nLAVIV, in addition to any other of our product candidates that may be approved by the FDA, will be subject to continual review by the FDA, and we cannot assure you that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise. For all of our product candidates, the FDA has required us to pay special attention to potential skin cancer and hypersensitivity reactions at the site of injection and, while we have seen no issues to date, we cannot rule out that issues may arise in the future. With the use of any newly marketed drug by a wider patient population, serious adverse events (\"AE's\") may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the drug itself. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, cause us to modify how we market our approved products, subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our financial condition and business.\nIf physicians do not follow our established protocols, the efficacy and safety of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on physicians and other healthcare professionals to follow our established protocols both as to the administration and the handling of our product candidates in connection with our clinical trials, and we continue to be dependent on physicians and other healthcare professionals to follow such protocols after our product candidates are commercialized. The treatment protocol requires each physician to verify the patient\u2019s name and date of birth with the patient and the patient records immediately prior to injection. In the event more than one patient\u2019s cells are delivered to a physician or we deliver the wrong patient\u2019s cells to the physician, which has occurred in the past, it is the physician\u2019s obligation to follow the treatment protocol and assure that the patient is treated with the correct cells. If the physicians and other healthcare professionals do not follow our protocol, the efficacy and safety of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur competitors in the pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology industries may have superior products, manufacturing capabilities, financial resources or marketing position.\nThe human healthcare products and services industry is extremely competitive. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies. Most of these competitors have more extensive research and development and marketing and manufacturing capabilities than we do, as well as greater financial resources. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop and market effectively our products against those of our competitors. If our products cannot compete effectively in the marketplace, our results of operations and financial position will suffer.\nOur cell and gene therapy product candidates may face competition in the future from biosimilars.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (\"BPCIA\"), as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of follow-on biological products was created. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. This data exclusivity does not prevent another company from developing a product that is highly similar to the original branded product, generating its own data and seeking approval. Data exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely upon the data within the innovator\u2019s application to support the biosimilar product\u2019s approval.\nIn his proposed budget for fiscal year 2014, President Obama proposed to cut this 12-year period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to prohibit additional periods of exclusivity due to minor changes in product formulations, a practice often referred to as \u201cevergreening.\u201d It is possible that Congress may take these or other measures to reduce or eliminate periods of exclusivity.\nAlthough final implementation of the BPCIA is not yet complete, such FDA implementation could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nWe may be liable for product liability claims not covered by insurance.\nPhysicians, patients and clinical trial participants who have used our products in the past or who use them in the future may bring product liability claims against us. While we have taken, and continue to take, what we believe are appropriate precautions, we may be unable to avoid significant liability exposure. We currently keep in force product liability insurance, although such insurance may not be adequate to fully cover any potential claims or may lapse in accordance with its terms prior to the assertion of claims. We may be unable to obtain product liability insurance in the future, or we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. Any insurance we obtain or have obtained in the past may not provide adequate coverage against any asserted claims. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, expenses and payment of damages;\n\u2022decreased demand for our products or any of our future products and services; or\n\u2022injury to our reputation.\nIf we are the subject of any future product liability claims, our business could be adversely affected, and if these claims are in excess of insurance coverage, if any, that we may possess, our financial position will suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe will incur additional expenses in connection with our exclusive channel collaboration agreements with Intrexon.\nPursuant to our exclusive channel collaboration agreements with Intrexon, we are responsible for future research, development and commercialization expenses of product candidates developed under such collaborations, including FCX-007, FCX-013 and our gene therapy program for arthritis, the effect of which we expect will increase the level of our overall research and development expenses going forward. Although all manufacturing, pre-clinical studies and human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, costs associated with the manufacturing, research and development of gene therapy product candidates are generally greater in comparison to small molecule product candidates. We have added personnel and expect to add additional personnel, either directly or through consulting arrangements, to support our exclusive channel collaborations with Intrexon.\nBecause development activities are determined pursuant to a joint steering committee comprised of Intrexon and ourselves and we have limited experience, future development costs associated with this program may be difficult to anticipate and exceed our expectations. Our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, unanticipated technical challenges, changes in the focus and direction of our development activities or adjustments necessitated by changes in the competitive landscape in which we operate. If we are unable to continue to financially support such collaboration due to our own working capital constraints, we may be forced to discontinue the collaboration or delay our activities.\nWe may not be able to retain the exclusive rights licensed to us by Intrexon to develop and commercialize our gene therapy product candidates.\nPursuant to our exclusive channel collaboration agreements, we are using Intrexon\u2019s technology in connection with various product candidates. The collaboration agreements grant us a license to use patents and other intellectual property of Intrexon in connection with the research, development, and commercialization of collaboration products within \u201cFields\u201d that we set forth above in the \u201cItem 1. Business - Intrexon Collaboration\u201d.\nThe exclusive channel collaboration agreements may be terminated by Intrexon if we fail to exercise diligent efforts in developing products through the collaboration or if we elect not to pursue the development of a therapy in a \u201cField\u201d identified by Intrexon that is a \u201cSuperior Therapy\u201d as defined in the agreement. Upon such termination, the products covered by the applicable exclusive channel collaboration agreement in active and ongoing Phase II or III clinical trials or later stage development through the exclusive channel collaboration agreement shall be entitled to be continued by us with a continuation of the related royalties for such products, and all rights to products covered by the exclusive channel collaboration agreement still in an earlier stage of development shall revert to Intrexon.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully perform under the exclusive channel collaboration agreements and if either agreement is terminated it may prevent us from achieving our business objectives and our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nWe engage third parties to perform various aspects of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. For instance, we obtain genetically-modified material from a sole source supplier in connection with the pre-clinical development of RDEB. We depend on these third parties to perform these activities on a timely basis in accordance with the protocol, good laboratory practices, good clinical practices, and other regulatory requirements. Our reliance on these third parties for pre-clinical and clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Accordingly, if these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed, terminated or our data may be rejected by the FDA. For example, our sole source supplier of genetically-modified material in connection with the pre-clinical development of RDEB were to cease to be able to supply genetically-modified material to us, or decline to supply genetically-modified material to us, our RDEB program would be delayed until we obtained an alternative source, which could take a considerable length of time. If it became necessary to replace a third party that was assisting with one of our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors that could be engaged to continue these activities, although it may result in a delay of the applicable pre-clinical study or clinical trial. If there are delays in testing or obtaining regulatory approvals as a result of a third party\u2019s failure to perform, our drug discovery and development costs will likely increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have limited manufacturing capacity and any manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and or adversely affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials.\nManufacturing biologic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently manufacture LAVIV and our non-genetically modified cell therapy product candidates at our facility in Exton, PA. We outsource the manufacturing of our genetically modified product candidates to a contract manufacturer in Mountain View, CA. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the operation of our sole facility and those of our contract manufacturer, which may be impacted by, among other things:\n\u2022\navailability, performance, or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier;\n\u2022\nquality of incoming biopsy samples;\n\u2022\ncapacity of our facility and those of contract manufacturer;\n\u2022\nthe performance of information technology systems;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ninclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nchanges in forecasts of future demand for product components;\n\u2022\ntiming and actual number of production runs for product components;\n\u2022\npotential facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses;\n\u2022\nupdating of manufacturing specifications; and\n\u2022\nproduct quality success rates and yields.\nIf the efficient manufacture and supply of our products is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments or supply constraints. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to supply our clinical trials due to manufacturing limitations, our trials may be delayed or compromised.\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturer must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA approval process, as well as other regulatory approval processes, and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It is a multi-year process to build and license a new manufacturing facility and it can take significant time to qualify and license a contract manufacturer.\nIf regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturer or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party service providers are subject to FDA and, potentially, in the future, foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, and supply constraints for our products.\nOur research, development and manufacturing operations depend on one facility each for both our cell therapy and gene therapy product candidates. If such facility is destroyed or is out of operation for a substantial period of time, our business will be adversely impacted.\nWe currently conduct our research, development and manufacturing operations related to LAVIV and our non-genetically modified product candidates in one facility located in Exton, Pennsylvania. We currently outsource our research, development and manufacturing operations related to our gene therapy product candidates to a contract manufacturer that uses one facility located in Mountain View, California.\nIf regulatory, manufacturing or other problems require us to discontinue production at either facility, we will not be able to supply our product to our customers or have supplies for our clinical trials, which would adversely impact our business. If either facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss or similar events, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity or replace our facility at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of either facility or equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to a third party. Even if we could transfer manufacturing to a third party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since the new facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements and we would need FDA approval before any products manufactured at that facility could be sold or used.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we or our licensors are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technologies, products and product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our, and our licensors, ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with\nemployees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business.\nThe patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain. The steps we or our licensors have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the U.S. Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents or those licensed to us and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. It is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our therapies will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or if any of our or our licensors\u2019 issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all, until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nOur issued patents, those that may be issued in the future or those licensed or acquired by us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patent may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. In particular, we do not know if competitors will be able to design variations on our treatment methods to circumvent our current and anticipated patent claims. Furthermore, competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us.\nOur pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our or our licensor\u2019s patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could harm our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, and if approved, market and sell our product candidates and to use our related proprietary technologies. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products or product candidates, including interference, post grant review, inter partes review or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing our products and then expend time and funding to redesign our product and/or product candidates so that it does not infringe others\u2019 patents while still allowing us to compete in the market with a substantially similar product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially\nharm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business. In addition, our involvement in any of these proceedings may cause us to incur substantial costs and result in diversion of management and technical personnel. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to develop, commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us.\nWe believe that use of our product candidates in clinical trials falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the U.S., which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As our product candidates progresses toward regulatory approval and commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. We attempt to ensure that our product candidates and the methods we employ to manufacture them, as well as the methods for their use we intend to promote, do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance they do not, however, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or our licensors have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our or our licensor\u2019s patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in those countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our and our licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We or our licensors may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. For example, methods of treatment and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Furthermore, generic drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 patents, requiring us or our licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Generic drug manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch generic versions of our products. Many countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors\u2019 efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of products, such as LAVIV, and our other products candidates patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the U.S. and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the U.S., and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether\nsuch extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and pre-clinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nChanges in patent law, including recent patent reform legislation, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve technological and legal complexity, and obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and patents we and our licensors may obtain in the future. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our and our licensors\u2019 patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors\u2019 issued patents.\nIn September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the U.S. transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, post grant review, inter-partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of our licensors. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our or our licensors\u2019 patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents and those licensed to us.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nTo protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, and to maintain our competitive position, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, it is our general policy to require our employees, consultants, advisors, and contractors to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breaches of these agreements. Our trade secrets may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States\nare less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us or our licensors to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. These proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our licensors, employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including each member of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our product candidates, but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or any strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Business Operations\nWe are dependent on our executives and other key professionals and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of our executives and other key scientific, manufacturing and quality personnel. The loss of any of these individuals, or our inability to recruit and train additional key personnel in a timely manner, could materially and adversely affect our business and our future prospects. A loss of one or more of our current executives or other key professionals could severely and negatively impact our operations. All of our employees, including our chief executive officer, are employed \u201cat-will,\u201d and any of them may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. We have no present intention of obtaining key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or key professionals.\nWe may need to attract, train and retain additional experienced executives and other key professionals in the future.\nIn the future, we may need to seek additional executives and other key professionals. There is a high demand for experienced executive, scientific, manufacturing and quality personnel in our industry. We do not know whether we will be able to attract, train and retain such experienced personnel in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed and purchased. For example, provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"PPACA\") have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business.\nThere is also significant economic pressure on state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the U.S. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products. In addition, under the PPACA, as states implement their health care marketplaces or operate under the federal exchange, the impact on drug manufacturers will depend in part on the formulary and benefit design decisions made by insurance sponsors or plans participating in these programs. It is possible that we may need to provide discounts or rebates to such plans in order to maintain favorable formulary access for our future products, which could have an adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. For example, we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which constrains our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nRequirements to report annually to CMS certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year; and\n\u2022\nState and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfer of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has further strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nTo the extent that any of our product candidates is ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations.\nIf we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in United States federal or state health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing manufacturing and laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organization, and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations or the unauthorized transfer of our proprietary information, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted.\nWe have generated significant net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOL's\u201d) as a result of our incurrence of losses and our conduct of research activities since inception. We generally are able to carry NOL's forward to reduce our tax liability in future years. However, our ability to utilize the NOL's is subject to the rules of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). Those sections generally restrict the use of NOL's after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of stockholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under Section 382 of the Code and the United States Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders over the applicable testing period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carry forwards and Section 383 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of tax a corporation may offset with carry forwards. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL carry forwards. We have completed several financings since our inception which we believe have resulted in \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of additional financings and subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, our NOL's may be subject to limitations and we may be required to pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if our NOL's were freely usable.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock began trading on NYSE MKT on May 17, 2013 and then on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\") on August 29, 2014. Between May 17, 2013 and December 31, 2015, our common stock has traded between $2.28 and $7.60. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, which include:\n\u2022\nwhether our clinical trials can be conducted within the timeframe that we expect and whether such trials will yield positive results;\n\u2022\nwhether our collaborations with Intrexon can be advanced with positive results within the timeframe and budget that we expect;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\na decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase our manufacturing capacity and reduce our manufacturing costs through the improvement of our manufacturing process, our ability to validate any such improvements with the relevant regulatory agencies and our ability to accomplish the foregoing on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or technologies offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnegative public opinion or perception of cell and gene therapies;\n\u2022\nthe inability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nthe failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the biopharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the U.S. equity capital markets and general political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nRandal J. Kirk and certain of his affiliates (including Intrexon) own a substantial percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of March 4, 2016, Randal J. Kirk and certain of his affiliates (including Intrexon, our collaboration partner on our gene therapy programs) beneficially owned approximately 16.6 million shares, or approximately 38%, of our common stock. Mr. Kirk and his affiliates may have interests that conflict with our other stockholders and, if acting together, have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership could delay or prevent any acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nAdditionally, two of our directors, Julian Kirk (who is the son of Randal J. Kirk) and Marcus Smith, are employees of Third Security, LLC, which is an affiliate of Randal J. Kirk.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which may cause our results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts, stockholders and investors.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing, implementation and cost of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nexpenses in connection with our exclusive channel collaboration agreements with Intrexon;\n\u2022\nthe timely and successful implementation of improved manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain personnel with the necessary strategic, technical and creative skills required for effective operations;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of expenditures by practitioners and their patients;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new technologies;\n\u2022\nproduct liability litigation, class action and derivative action litigation, or other litigation;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations;\n\u2022\nthe state of the debt and/or equity capital markets at the time of any proposed offering we choose to initiate;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions into our operations;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation and legal developments regarding our product candidates in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we may operate in the future; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAs a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make pricing, service, technology or marketing decisions or business or technology acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Due to any of these factors, our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts, stockholders and investors in any future period, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or as a result of the perception that these sales could occur, which could occur if we issue a large number of shares of common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) in connection with a future financing, as our common stock is trading at low levels. These factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock or other equity securities. As of the date of this report, all of our outstanding shares held by non-affiliates are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. In addition to our common stock outstanding, as of December 31, 2015, we had warrants and options outstanding that were exercisable for a total of 7,146,718 shares of common stock.\nWe have not declared any dividends on our common stock to date, and we have no intention of declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe decision to pay cash dividends on our common stock rests with our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, unencumbered cash, capital requirements and financial condition. We do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future, as we intend to use any excess cash to fund our operations. Investors in our common stock should not expect to receive dividend income on their investment, and investors will be dependent on the appreciation of our common stock to earn a return on their investment.\nProvisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay stockholders\u2019 attempts to replace or remove current members of our Board of Directors.\nOur charter documents provide for staggered terms for the members of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is divided into three staggered classes, and each director serves a term of three years. At stockholders\u2019 meetings, only those directors comprising one of the three classes will have completed their term and be subject to re-election or replacement.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with designations, rights and preferences as they may determine. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has in the past and may in the future, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. This type of preferred stock could also be issued to discourage, delay or prevent a change in our control.\nThe use of a staggered Board of Directors and the ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock are traditional anti-takeover measures. These provisions in our charter documents make it difficult for a majority stockholder to gain control of the Board of Directors and of our company. These provisions may be beneficial to our management and our Board of Directors in a hostile tender offer and may have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in such a tender offer, or who may want to replace some or all of the members of our Board of Directors.\nProvisions in our bylaws provide for indemnification of officers and directors, which could require us to direct funds away from our business and future products.\nOur bylaws provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors. We have in the past and may in the future be required to advance costs incurred by an officer or director and to pay judgments, fines and expenses incurred by an officer or director, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, as a result of actions or proceedings in which our officers and directors are involved by reason of being or having been an officer or director of our company. Funds paid in satisfaction of judgments, fines and expenses may be funds we need for the operation of our business and the development of our product candidates, thereby affecting our ability to attain profitability.\nProvisions of the warrants issued in connection with certain of our prior financings provide for preferential treatment to the holders of the warrants and could impede a sale of the Company.\nThe warrants we issued in connection with certain of our prior financings gives each holder the option to receive a cash payment based on a Black-Scholes valuation upon our change of control or upon our failure to be listed on any trading market. We are required, at the warrant holder\u2019s option, exercisable at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the announcement of a fundamental transaction, to redeem all or any portion of these warrants from the warrant holder by paying to the holder an amount of cash equal to the Black-Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant on or prior to the date of the consummation of such fundamental transaction.\nAn active market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nIn the past, we have had a limited, volatile and sporadic public trading market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on NASDAQ, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, especially given the large percentage of our common stock held by our affiliates. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell shares without depressing the market price for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 89631, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "FCSC"}
