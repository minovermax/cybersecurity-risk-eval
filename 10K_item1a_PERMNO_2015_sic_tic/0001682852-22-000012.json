{"cik": "1682852", "company": "Moderna, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, together with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risk factors we describe below could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks related to COVID-19, mRNA-1273 and our other vaccine candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nWe may encounter difficulties producing, shipping or successfully commercializing our COVID-19 vaccine consistent with our existing or potential contractual obligations including due to delays or difficulties experienced by our commercial partners.\nIn response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuing to pursue the rapid manufacture, distribution and clinical testing of our COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), which is our only commercial product and source of product revenues. We may encounter difficulties producing the vaccine on the timelines and in the quantities set forth in our existing or future supply agreements. We may also be unsuccessful in entering into contracts for future sales of COVID-19 vaccines. Our ability to commercialize an effective vaccine depends on our manufacturing capability, both at our own manufacturing facility and those of our manufacturing partners, which we rapidly scaled in response to the pandemic. We are committing substantial financial resources and personnel to the development, manufacture and distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine, including to support the scale-up of manufacturing to enable our pandemic response, which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs. We may need to, or the U.S. government may require us to, divert resources and capital from our other programs to the production of COVID-19 vaccines.\nWe do not have sufficient internal manufacturing infrastructure to support the global roll-out of our COVID-19 vaccine on our own. We have entered into strategic collaborations for the production, as well as for commercial fill-finish manufacturing, of our COVID-19 vaccine to supply markets both in and outside the United States. We may need to engage additional collaborators in the future, including contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), government and non-government organizations, and other manufacturing partners, to assist in meeting our capacity needs. If we cannot enter into such arrangements on favorable terms, or at all, our ability to develop, manufacture and distribute our COVID-19 vaccine would be adversely affected.\nPrior to 2020, we had not ramped up our organization for a commercial launch of any product, and doing so during a pandemic with an urgent, critical global need poses additional challenges, such as setting up distribution channels, building global teams with specialized skills, and managing potential intellectual property disputes or challenges. We may also face challenges sourcing a sufficient amount of raw materials to support the demand for our COVID-19 vaccine. We may be unable to effectively create a supply chain for the vaccine to adequately support demand as we rely on our third-party collaborators being able to fulfill demand. For example, we have in the past and may in the future experience international shipping delays as our supply chain expands and grows more complex. Any capacity or production issues or delays experienced by our collaborators may cause us to fail to meet certain product volume or delivery timing obligations under our COVID-19 supply agreements. Furthermore, we will require significant additional investment, whether from our own capital resources or other sources of funding, as we continue to expand our commercial launch efforts. We cannot guarantee that any of these challenges and requirements will be met in a timely manner or at all.\nThe pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive. We may be unsuccessful in competing effectively in the market for existing products, new treatment methods, and new technologies, including for COVID-19 vaccines.\nThe pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of products for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target, including COVID-19 vaccines, and these institutions and competitors may have:\n\u2022greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and human resources than we have at every stage of the discovery, development, manufacture, and commercialization of products;\n\u2022more extensive experience in preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and in manufacturing, marketing, and selling products;\n\u2022multiple products that have been approved or are in late stages of development; and\n\u2022collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.\nWe face intense competition with respect to our COVID-19 vaccine from other vaccines and treatments, and our vaccine may not continue to compete favorably with existing or future products. Over two dozen COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized in various jurisdictions, including those produced by AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer/BioNTech, and many more remain in development. These vaccines or other treatments, such as antiviral pills produced by Pfizer and Merck, may prove to be safer, more\nTable of Content\neffective, more convenient, have fewer side effects, be easier to ship or distribute, or able to be developed at a lower cost than our vaccine. These factors, or the perception of these factors, among others, could lead to a competitor\u2019s vaccine or other treatment to become the standard of care for COVID-19, have broader market acceptance, or be more successfully commercialized. The actual or perceived success or failure of other entities may adversely impact our ability to commercialize our COVID-19 vaccine.\nWe also will face competition from products that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of conditions we target. For example, we are developing a seasonal flu vaccine, for which there is a well-developed market, and we may be unsuccessful in developing a product or achieving market share. We also may compete with products that are under development for the treatment of conditions we target, which other products may be more effective, safer, less expensive, or marketed and sold more effectively.\nIf we successfully develop and obtain approval for investigational medicines, we will face competition based on many factors, including the safety and effectiveness of our products relative to any alternative therapies; the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals; the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities; the price of any approved medicine; reimbursement coverage; and patent position.\nOur competitors may commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop, and may benefit from strategic alliances with or funding from larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If our competitors are more successful in commercializing their products than we are, our competitive position and business would be adversely affected. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our products, if approved.\nWe may be delayed or prevented from receiving full regulatory approval of our COVID-19 vaccine in certain jurisdictions or for certain demographics.\nEfficacy, effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity data with respect to our COVID-19 vaccine, as well as real-world evidence, continue to accumulate. Further results from clinical trials, as well as the experience of vaccinated individuals, could show diminished protection compared to the results released to date, as efficacy and antibody persistence wane over time. Additionally, we may observe new, more frequent or adverse events of greater severity in subjects participating in ongoing clinical trials or among those individuals vaccinated with our COVID-19 vaccine. For example, some studies have suggested that our vaccine may be associated with higher rates of myocarditis and pericarditis in young males compared to other COVID-19 vaccines. Unexpected safety issues could significantly damage our reputation and that of our mRNA platform, and lead to other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need to re-design our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources. In addition, the interpretation of the data from our clinical trials of our COVID-19 vaccine by the FDA and other regulators may differ from our interpretation and such agencies may require us to conduct additional studies or analyses, which may lead to delays in obtaining authorization for these medicines. For example, in October 2021, the FDA requested that we explore a lower dosage for our COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents, which extended the length of clinical trials in this population, delaying potential authorization in the U.S. These factors could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval of our COVID-19 vaccine in certain jurisdictions or for certain demographics.\nThe assays used to estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines have only recently been developed and continue to evolve. Validation reports for these assays have been submitted for review to regulatory agencies. Results obtained in clinical studies of mRNA-1273 with later versions of these assays may be less positive than the results we have obtained to date. Moreover, blood samples from people who have recovered from COVID-19, used to benchmark the level of antibodies produced by subjects receiving mRNA-1273 in clinical studies, have been taken from a small number of people and may not be representative of the antibody levels in a broader population of people who have recovered from COVID-19, particularly as variant strains continue to emerge. The future results in clinical studies of mRNA-1273 may not be as positive when compared to the antibody levels in other blood samples.\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing future versions of our COVID-19 vaccine to protect against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or booster doses of our vaccine may not protect against such variants, and a market for vaccines and boosters against these variants may not develop.\nOur original COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, was developed based upon the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve, new strains of the virus, or those that are already in circulation, may prove more transmissible or cause more severe forms of COVID-19 disease than the predominant strains to date. For example, the Omicron and Delta variants have been observed to be more transmissible, or contagious, than previous variants. There is a risk that mRNA-1273 will not be as effective in protecting against these or other future variant strains. For example, a standard two-dose inoculation of mRNA-1273 appears to be less effective at neutralizing the Omicron variant, which emerged in November 2021, than against the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, administration of booster doses of our vaccine may prove to be\nTable of Content\nineffective, or less effective than desired, against certain variants. We have several development candidates against variants of concern, and may develop others in the future. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we are slower to develop variant-specific vaccines than competitors, or these vaccine candidates prove less effective than competitors\u2019 vaccines, these shortcomings may lead to reputational harm, loss of market share, and adverse financial results. It is also possible that we may expend significant resources adapting our COVID-19 vaccine or conducting clinical trials to protect against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but that a market for this adapted vaccine does not develop or demand does not align with our projections or cost expenditures.\nThe regulatory pathway for COVID-19 vaccines is continually evolving, and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\nOur COVID-19 vaccine has moved rapidly through the regulatory review and authorization and approval processes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. The speed at which COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics are being created and tested is atypical, and evolving or changing plans or priorities within the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including changes based on new knowledge of COVID-19 and how the disease, and new variants of the virus, affect the human body, may significantly affect the regulatory timeline for further authorizations or approvals for our COVID-19 vaccine, including variant-specific versions of the vaccine. We cannot anticipate or predict with certainty the timelines or regulatory processes that may be required for the authorization or approval of updated versions of our COVID-19 vaccine, or vaccines that may be developed to fight against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nAlthough we currently operate under an EUA provided by the FDA for mRNA-1273 for as a booster dose for adults 18 years and older at least five months after completing a primary series of the vaccine, and as a third dose in immunocompromised individuals 18 years of age or older who have undergone solid organ transplantation, the FDA may revoke such authorization if it determines that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, and we cannot predict how long the EUA will remain in place. Such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways.\nThe EMA has made a positive recommendation for the administration of Spikevax for children ages 6 to 11, in addition to the existing conditional marketing authorization from the EMA for Spikevax in adults and adolescents ages 12 and older. Although a conditional marketing authorization is a formal marketing authorization and covers all batches produced for the EU, we are obliged to provide certain additional information and data by specified timelines as conditions of the authorization, and the EMA can take regulatory action if we fail to comply. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually; however, the EMA may decide not to renew. If new data emerges that shows the benefits of our vaccine do not continue to outweigh its risks, the EMA can suspend or revoke our authorization. Similar temporary, emergency authorizations that we have received for mRNA-1273 could be revoked if the conditions for granting the authorization no longer apply. Any such revocation of the temporary authorization to distribute mRNA-1273, without receiving final approval to distribute the vaccine, could adversely impact our ability to realize the full financial benefit of our existing or future supply agreements.\nOur ability to deliver our vaccine to customers may be curtailed by one or more government actions or interventions, which may be more likely during a global health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt is possible that one or more government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly diminish our rights or opportunities with respect to our COVID-19 vaccine, limiting our economic prospects. In the United States, the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the Defense Production Act), gives the U.S. government rights and authorities that may directly or indirectly diminish such rights or economic opportunities. Our current and potential third-party service providers may be impacted by government entities potentially invoking the Defense Production Act or other potential restrictions to all or a portion of services they might otherwise offer.\nGovernment entities imposing restrictions or limitations on our third-party service providers may require us to obtain alternative service sources for our COVID-19 vaccine or our vaccine candidates. If we are unable to timely enter into alternative arrangements on satisfactory terms, we will experience delays in the development or production of our COVID-19 vaccine and our vaccine candidates, increased expenses, and delays in distribution or commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine, or, when and if approved, our vaccine candidates.\nIn addition, our supply contracts with the U.S. government for our COVID-19 vaccine restrict our ability to export vaccine that is produced from our U.S.-dedicated supply chain to markets outside the United States prior to satisfying our delivery obligations to the U.S. government. Furthermore, governments have threatened to block or limit the export of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in their territories in instances where manufacturers have been delayed or have not fully satisfied their delivery obligations to those governments. Governments of the jurisdictions in which we or our contract manufacturing partners produce our COVID-19 vaccine may impose export restrictions, prohibiting us from delivering our COVID-19 vaccine to customers in other jurisdictions. The imposition of export controls could severely and adversely impact our manufacturing activities, commercial activities and financial results.\nTable of Content\nIn addition, during a global health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where the spread of a disease needs to be controlled, closed or heavily regulated, national borders create challenges and potential delays in our development and production activities and may necessitate that we pursue strategies to develop and produce our vaccines and vaccine candidates within self-contained national or international borders, at potentially much greater expense and with longer timeframes for public distribution.\nRisks related to our pipeline, product development and regulatory review\nPreclinical development is lengthy and uncertain, especially for a new class of medicines such as mRNA, and therefore our preclinical programs or development candidates may be delayed, terminated, or may never advance to the clinic, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business.\nMuch of our pipeline is in preclinical development, and these programs could be delayed or not advance into the clinic. Before we can initiate clinical trials for a development candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical studies, including IND-enabling good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology testing, to support our planned INDs in the United States, or similar applications in other jurisdictions. We must also complete extensive work on Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) activities (including yield, purity and stability data) to be included in an IND submission. CMC activities for a new class of medicines such as mRNA require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development, which is uncertain and lengthy. For instance, batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our development candidates. If we must produce new batches, preclinical studies or clinical trials could be delayed. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies, whether the FDA or other regulators will accept the results, or if the outcome of our preclinical testing, studies, and CMC activities will ultimately support the further development of our programs. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications will result in the FDA or other regulators allowing clinical trials to begin.\nClinical development is lengthy and uncertain, especially with a new class of medicines such as mRNA medicines. Clinical trials of our investigational medicines may be delayed and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business.\nClinical testing is expensive, complex and lengthy, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. There is a high rate of attrition for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials and most investigational medicines that commence clinical trials are never approved as products. We may not be able to initiate, may experience delays in, or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our investigational medicines. We and our strategic collaborators also may experience unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any clinical trials that we or they conduct that could delay or prevent us or them from successfully developing our investigational medicines and gaining approval from regulators. Delays or other events that might prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials include:\n\u2022regulators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on favorable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective contract research organizations (CROs);\n\u2022changes to the scale and site of our manufacturing could lead to significant delays or changes in our clinical trial designs;\n\u2022the outcome of our preclinical studies and our early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results;\n\u2022we may be unable to establish or achieve clinically meaningful endpoints for our studies;\n\u2022if we make changes to our investigational medicines after clinical trials have commenced (which we have done in the past), we may be required to repeat earlier stages or delay later stages of clinical testing;\n\u2022clinical trials of any investigational medicines may fail to show safety or efficacy, or produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, or we may decide to abandon product development programs;\n\u2022preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many investigational medicines believed to have performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022our investigational medicines, or other medicines in the same class as ours, may have undesirable side effects, such as the immunogenicity of the LNPs or their components, the immunogenicity of the protein made by the mRNA, or degradation products, any of which could lead to serious adverse events, or other effects;\n\u2022administration of our LNPs could lead to systemic side effects related to the components of the LNPs and could contribute, in whole or in part, to one or more of the following: immune reactions, infusion reactions, complement reactions, opsonization reactions, antibody reactions, or reactions to PEG;\nTable of Content\n\u2022significant adverse events or other side effects could be observed in our trials, including those involving dosing of young, human subjects with an investigational medicine;\n\u2022our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or withdraw from the trial, which may require that we add new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022regulators may impose a complete or partial clinical hold on a trial, or we or our investigators, IRBs, or ethics committees may elect to suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable benefit-risk ratio;\n\u2022regulators may impose a complete or partial clinical hold on clinical trials of other companies working on mRNA medicines;\n\u2022the cost of preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies and clinical trials of any investigational medicines may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022the supply or quality of our investigational medicines or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022safety and efficacy concerns regarding one or more of our investigational medicines will be considered by us and by the FDA and other global regulators as we pursue clinical trials of new investigational medicines, develop effective informed consent documentation and work with IRBs and scientific review committees (SRCs);\n\u2022safety or efficacy concerns could arise from nonclinical or clinical testing of other therapies targeting a similar disease state or other therapies, such as gene therapy, that are perceived as similar to ours;\n\u2022adverse side effects could be observed in future clinical trials where our investigational medicines are administered in combination with other therapies (such as the co-administration of our PCV investigational medicine, mRNA-4157); and\n\u2022a lack of adequate funding to continue a particular clinical trial.\nThe FDA has indicated that, prior to commencing later-stage clinical trials for our programs, we will need to develop assays to measure and predict the potency of a given dose of our investigational medicines. Any delay in developing assays that are acceptable to the FDA or other regulators could delay the start of future clinical trials. Additionally, we have conducted and may conduct in the future clinical trials that utilize an \u201copen-label\u201d trial design, where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an approved drug or placebo. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results from a controlled environment with a placebo or active control. Further, the FDA or other regulators may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials. Significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays for our investigational medicines could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. Any delays in the development of our investigational medicines may harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nThere are risks that are unique to each of our programs and modalities and risks that are applicable across programs and modalities. These risks may impair our ability to advance one or more of our programs in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval, or ultimately commercialize our products, or cause us to experience significant delays in doing so, any of which may materially harm our business.\nWe have a large pipeline of development candidates and investigational medicines, of which many are in clinical trials or have an open IND. Certain features in our development candidates and investigational medicines, including those related to mRNA, chemical modifications, surface chemistries, LNPs, and their components, may result in risks that apply to some or all of our programs and modalities. As our development candidates and investigational medicines progress, we or others may determine that: certain of our risk allocation decisions were incorrect or insufficient; we made platform-level technology mistakes; individual programs or our mRNA science in general has technology or biology risks that were unknown or under-appreciated; our choices on how to develop our infrastructure to support our scale will result in an inability to manufacture our investigational medicines for clinical trials or otherwise impair our manufacturing; or we have allocated resources in such a way that we cannot recover large investments or rapidly re-direct capital.\nWe utilize earlier programs in a modality to understand the technology risks within the modality, including manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties. Even if our earlier programs in a modality are successful in any phase of development, any program may fail at a later phase of development, and other programs within the same modality may fail at any phase of development, including at phases where earlier programs in that modality were successful. This may be a result of technical challenges unique to that program or due to biology risk, which is unique to every program. The biology risk across the majority of our pipeline represents targets and pathways not clinically validated by one or more approved drugs, and the risk that the targets or pathways that we have selected may not be effective will continue to apply across the majority of our current and future programs.\nAs we progress our programs through clinical development, new technical challenges may arise that cause an entire modality to fail. Additionally, any portfolio spanning risks, whether known or unknown, if realized in any one of our programs, would have a material and adverse effect on our other programs and on our business as a whole.\nTable of Content\nThere are also specific additional risks to certain of our modalities and our programs as a whole. For example, prophylactic vaccines typically require clinical testing in up to tens of thousands of healthy volunteers to define an approvable benefit-risk profile. The need to show a high degree of safety and tolerability when dosing healthy individuals could result in rare and even spurious safety findings, negatively impacting a program prior to or after commercial launch. Even if we observe positive safety, tolerability, and levels of immunogenicity in early clinical trials, there can be no assurance that we will observe acceptable safety or efficacy profiles in later-stage trials required for approval of these programs.\nFor neoantigen cancer vaccines, to date, no molecular (non-cell-based) therapeutic protein vaccine has been shown to be effective against cancer and there are many clinical and manufacturing challenges to personalized medicines, including cell-based therapies and vaccines. These risks include: a rapid production turn-around time that is measured in weeks in order to supply patients in our clinical trials before further progression and mutation of their tumors, the significant costs incurred in making individualized vaccines, and potential lack of immune responses due to the biology of the tumor or immune status of the patient. These risks apply to our personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) and other neoepitope investigational medicine programs. Additionally, there may be challenges in delivering an adequate quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) required to drive efficacy due to the limitation in volume of API that can be delivered to a specific location, like a tumor or injured tissue. Our investigational therapies for local injections often require specialized skills for conducting a clinical trial that could delay trials or slow or impair commercialization of an approved investigational medicine due to the poor adoption of injected local therapeutics or intratumoral therapies. In addition, the uncertain translatability of target selection from preclinical animal models, including mouse and non-human primate models, to successful clinical trial results may be impossible, particularly for immuno-oncology and systemic therapies, and cancer vaccines. In general, several biological steps are required for delivery of mRNA to translate into therapeutically active medicines. These processing steps may differ between individuals or tissues, potentially leading to variable levels of therapeutic protein, variable activity, immunogenicity, or variable distribution to tissues for a therapeutic effect. Gene therapies and mRNA-based medicines may activate one or more immune responses against any and all components of the drug product (e.g., the mRNA or the delivery vehicle, such as an LNP) as well as against the encoded protein, giving rise to potential immune reaction related adverse events. Eliciting an immune response against the encoded protein may impede our ability to achieve a pharmacologic effect upon repeat administration or a side effect. These risks apply to all of our programs, including our systemic secreted therapeutics and systemic intracellular therapeutics modalities.\nWe may experience delays in identifying and enrolling participants in our clinical trials, which would delay the progress of our investigational medicines and result in increased expenses.\nIdentifying and qualifying trial participants for our clinical trials of our investigational medicines is critical to our success. Difficulties or delays in enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our investigational medicines and obtain regulatory approval of potential products.\nWe may be unable to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of trial participants, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a trial, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. As we did in our Phase 3 clinical study of mRNA-1273, we may slow enrollment in a trial to focus on achieving greater diversity in the subject population. Patient and subject enrollment is affected by factors including:\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022complexity and design of the study protocol;\n\u2022size of the patient population;\n\u2022eligibility criteria for the study in question, including age-based eligibility criteria limiting subject enrollment to adolescent or pediatric populations;\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective trial participants;\n\u2022availability of competing therapies and clinical trials, including by third parties or our own clinical trials;\n\u2022patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022ability to monitor trial participants adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022clinicians\u2019 and trial participants\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the investigational medicine being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n\u2022adverse results or other adverse safety signals in our trials or related to other investigational medicines, and the resulting negative publicity, which could discourage potential trial participants and their doctors from participating in our trials;\n\u2022in the case of our PCV, the need to wait for the manufacture of the personalized drug product; and\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain participant informed consent.\nTable of Content\nWe also have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators control the development of certain of our investigational medicines, which may provide us limited or no ability to influence the enrollment rate of our clinical trials. Even if we or our strategic collaborators are able to enroll trial participants, there is no guarantee that they will ultimately be dosed as part of, or complete, a clinical trial.\nmRNA drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel nature of this new class of medicines, and the negative perception of the efficacy, safety, or tolerability profile of any investigational medicines that we or others develop could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, advance our investigational medicines, or obtain regulatory approvals.\nNo mRNA medicine has been granted full or conditional approval by the FDA or other regulators, other than COVID-19 vaccines. Successful discovery and development of mRNA medicines by us or our strategic collaborators is highly uncertain and depends on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our or their control. We constantly make business decisions and take calculated risks to advance our development efforts and pipeline, including those related to mRNA technology, delivery technology, and manufacturing processes, which ultimately may be unsuccessful.\nOur mRNA investigational medicines that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to advance, experience delays in the clinic, experience clinical holds, or fail to reach the market for many reasons, including:\n\u2022nonclinical or preclinical study, or clinical trial, results may show potential mRNA medicines to be less effective than desired or to have harmful or problematic side effects or toxicities;\n\u2022adverse results in our clinical trials, or in those of others developing similar products, or adverse effects relating to mRNA, or our LNPs, may lead to negative publicity or delays in or termination of one or more of our programs;\n\u2022adverse events related to products that are perceived to be similar to mRNA medicines, such as those related to gene therapy or gene editing, could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs, increased regulatory scrutiny, decreased confidence by patients and clinical trial collaborators in our investigational medicines, and less demand for any product that we may develop;\n\u2022the insufficient ability of our translational models to reduce risk or predict outcomes in humans, particularly given that each component of our investigational medicines and development candidates may have a dependent or independent effect on safety, tolerability, and efficacy, which may, among other things, be species-dependent;\n\u2022manufacturing failures or insufficient supply of cGMP materials for clinical trials, or higher than expected cost could delay or set back clinical trials, or make mRNA-based medicines commercially unattractive;\n\u2022changes that we make to optimize our manufacturing, testing or formulating of cGMP materials could impact the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of our investigational medicines and development candidates;\n\u2022pricing or reimbursement issues or other factors that delay clinical trials or make any mRNA medicine uneconomical or noncompetitive with other therapies;\n\u2022our large pipeline of development candidates and investigational medicines could result in a greater quantity of reportable adverse events, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, other reportable negative clinical outcomes, manufacturing reportable events or material clinical events that could lead to clinical delay or hold by the FDA or applicable regulatory authority or other clinical delays, any of which could negatively impact the perception of one or more of our programs, as well as our business as a whole;\n\u2022failure to timely advance our programs or a failure or delay in receiving necessary regulatory approvals due to, among other factors, slow or failure to complete enrollment in clinical trials, withdrawal by trial participants from trials, failure to achieve trial endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis, data integrity issues, preparation of a BLA, or the equivalent application, discussions with the FDA or EMA, a regulatory request for additional nonclinical or clinical data, or safety formulation or manufacturing issues may lead to our inability to obtain sufficient funding;\n\u2022new legislation or regulations passed by U.S., state, or foreign governments in response to negative public perception of mRNA medicines; and\n\u2022the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent our mRNA medicines from being commercialized.\nBecause we are developing some of our development candidates or investigational medicines for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and, in some cases, using new endpoints or methodologies, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results.\nThere are no pharmacologic therapies approved to treat the underlying causes of many diseases that we currently attempt to address or may address in the future. For instance, for both MMA and PA, few clinical trials have been attempted, and there are no approved drugs to treat these diseases. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials of investigational medicines for the treatment of these disorders and other disorders may take longer, be more costly, or be less effective due to the novelty of development in these diseases.\nTable of Content\nEven if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint to a degree of statistical significance in any pivotal or other clinical trials we or our strategic collaborators conduct. Further, even if we do achieve the pre-specified criteria, our trials may produce results that are unpredictable or inconsistent with the results of the more traditional efficacy endpoints in the trial. The FDA could give overriding weight to other efficacy endpoints over a primary endpoint, even if we achieve statistically significant results on that endpoint, if we do not do so on our secondary efficacy endpoints. The FDA also weighs the benefits of a product against its risks and may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of licensure. Regulators in other countries may make similar findings with respect to these endpoints.\nSome of our investigational medicines are classified as gene therapies by the FDA and the EMA. The association of our medicines with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens, impair the reputation of our investigational medicines, or negatively impact our platform or our business.\nThere have been few approved gene therapy products in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, and there have been well-reported significant adverse events associated with their testing and use. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future, and the implications for mRNA-based therapies are unknown. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and convenes the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. In the EU, mRNA has been characterized as a gene therapy medicinal product, which falls within a broader category known as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), which are subject to additional regulatory requirements. In certain countries, mRNA therapies have not yet been classified or any such classification is not known to us; for example, in Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency has not taken a position on the regulatory classification. Notwithstanding the differences between mRNA medicines and gene therapies, the classification of some of our mRNA investigational medicines as gene therapies in the United States, the EU, and potentially other countries could adversely impact our ability to develop our investigational medicines, negatively impacting our platform and our business. For instance, a clinical hold on gene therapy products may apply to our mRNA investigational medicines irrespective of the differences between gene therapies and mRNA.\nAdverse events reported with respect to gene therapies could adversely impact one or more of our programs. Although our mRNA development candidates and investigational medicines are generally designed not to make any permanent changes to cell DNA, regulatory agencies or others could believe that adverse effects of gene therapies caused by introducing new DNA and irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell could also be a risk for our mRNA investigational therapies, and as a result may delay one or more of our trials or impose additional testing for long-term side effects. Any new requirements and guidelines promulgated by regulatory review agencies may negatively affect our business by lengthening the regulatory review process, requiring us to perform additional or larger studies, or increasing our development costs, any of which could lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent advancement or approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines, or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations, or restrictions. As we advance our investigational medicines, we will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and advisory committees and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of some or all of our investigational medicines.\nAdditionally, we have established Moderna Genomics (MGX) with the vision of becoming a leader in large, complex genomic editing. In November 2021, we announced a multi-year research collaboration with Metagenomi to leverage Metagenomi\u2019s discovery platform and expertise to develop next-generation in vivo gene editing therapies. Our work in genomic editing is subject to all risks associated with gene therapies. Although there have been significant advances in recent years in fields of gene therapy and genome editing, in vivo CRISPR-based genome editing technologies are relatively new and their therapeutic utility is largely unproven. Public perception and related media coverage of potential therapy-related efficacy or safety issues, as well as ethical concerns related specifically to genome editing, may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials. In addition, any review conducted by an institutional biosafety committee may result in delay or prevent initiation of a gene therapy clinical trial.\nAdditionally, if any such therapeutic is approved, physicians and patients may be slow or fail to accept these novel and personalized treatments. Physicians, health care providers and third-party payors often are slow to adopt new products, technologies and treatment practices, particularly those that may also require additional upfront costs and training. Physicians may not be willing to undergo training to adopt these novel and potentially personalized therapies, may decide the particular therapy is too complex or potentially risky to adopt without appropriate training, and may choose not to administer the therapy. Further, due to health conditions, genetic profile or other reasons, certain patients may not be candidates for the therapies. In addition, responses by federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments to negative public perception, ethical concerns or financial considerations may result in new legislation, regulations, or medical standards that could limit our ability to develop or commercialize any product candidates, obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability. Based on these and other factors, health care providers and payors may decide that the benefits of these new therapies do not or will not outweigh their costs.\nTable of Content\nA breakthrough therapy designation or fast track designation, or accelerated approval, by the FDA or comparable pathways in other jurisdictions for a drug may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it would not increase the likelihood that the drug will receive marketing approval.\nWe have received Fast Track Designation for some of our investigational medicines and may seek Fast Track Designation or breakthrough therapy designation for others. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant either designation, and the receipt of either designation for a drug may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. Even if one or more of our investigational medicines qualify for Fast Track Designation or as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the investigational medicine no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Additionally, even if we obtain accelerated approval in the United States or under comparable pathways in other jurisdictions, we may face requirements and limitations that will adversely affect our prospects. For example, the FDA generally requires pre-approval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Further,\nwe may not receive ultimate approval or we may be approved only for a limited indication, we may not successfully complete required post-approval trials, such trials may not confirm the clinical benefit of our drug, or approval of the drug may be withdrawn.\nWe may fail to obtain and maintain orphan drug designations for our investigational medicines.\nWe may file for orphan drug designation where available for our investigational medicines. We may never receive such designation for any particular medicine. Although we have received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and the European Commission for PA (mRNA-3927) and GSD1a (mRNA-3745), orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication, or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition, and only the first applicant to receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity. Even after an orphan-designated product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOur investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\nDuring the 12-year period of exclusivity provided by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, another company may still market a competing version of a product if the FDA approves a BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the other company\u2019s product. The BPCI Act is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty.\nThere is also a risk that any exclusivity we receive for an investigational medicine could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCI Act, some of which may impact the BPCI Act\u2019s exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIf we cannot obtain, or are delayed in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to commercialize, or will be delayed in commercializing, investigational medicines we may develop.\nAny mRNA medicine we may develop and the activities associated with its development and commercialization, including design, testing, manufacture, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulators. To obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our investigational medicines, we and our strategic collaborators must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe, pure, and potent in humans, including the target population. Successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a BLA to the FDA, a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the EMA, and similar marketing applications to comparable global regulatory authorities, for each investigational medicine and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any investigational medicines.\nWe have not received approval to market any investigational medicine, other than our COVID-19 vaccine, in any jurisdiction, and our current or future development candidates or investigational medicines may never obtain regulatory approval. We have limited experience in filing and supporting the necessary applications for marketing approvals and may need to rely on third-party CROs or\nTable of Content\nregulatory consultants to assist us in this process. Although we expect to submit BLAs for our mRNA-based investigational medicines in the United States, other jurisdictions may consider our mRNA-based investigational medicines to be new drugs, not biologics, and require different marketing applications. Preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in another. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. Any investigational medicines we develop may be ineffective, only moderately effective, or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nAdditionally, the process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity, and novelty of the investigational medicines involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may delay the review of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing approval of an investigational medicine. Additional delays or non-approval may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval.\nThe FDA and other regulators review the CMC section of regulatory filings. Any aspects found unsatisfactory by regulatory agencies may result in delays in clinical trials and commercialization. In addition, the regulatory agencies conduct pre-approval inspections at the time of a BLA. Any findings by regulatory agencies and failure to comply with requirements may lead to delay in approval and failure to commercialize the potential investigational medicine.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any investigational medicines we may develop, the commercial prospects for those investigational medicines will be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nOur products are, and any future products will be, subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, the applicable regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the holder of an approved BLA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA. The holder of an approved BLA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our investigational medicines.\nIf we, our contract manufacturers or other strategic collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our investigational medicines, a regulatory agency may: issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law; seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; suspend or withdraw regulatory approval or revoke a license; suspend any ongoing clinical trials; refuse to approve a pending BLA or supplements to a BLA submitted by us; seize or recall investigational medicines or products; or refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize any approved products and generate revenues.\nAdditionally, the FDA or other regulators could require us to adopt a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for any approved investigational medicine to ensure that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks for each potential patient, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients, a communication plan to health care practitioners, extensive patient monitoring, or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled, restrictive, and more costly than what is typical for the industry. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any product that we develop, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including the suspension or withdrawal of approvals and licenses; the addition of warning labels; changes to the way a product is administered; the requirement to conduct further clinical trials; lawsuits or increased liability for harm to patients and their children; and reputational harm. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any products we develop and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nTable of Content\nEven though the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine/Spikevax has been approved by the FDA for individuals 18 years of age and older in the United States, it remains the subject of regulatory scrutiny. For example, we are required to conduct post-marketing studies to further assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax. Additionally, we have committed to conducting additional post-marketing safety studies, including conducting a pregnancy registry study to evaluate pregnancy and infant outcomes after receipt of Spikevax during pregnancy. We or others could identify previously unknown side effects, or known side effects could be observed as being more frequent or severe than in clinical studies or earlier post-marketing periods, in which case:\n\u2022sales of mRNA-1273 may be more modest than originally anticipated;\n\u2022the FDA and other regulatory agencies may revoke authorizations for the vaccine;\n\u2022we may decide, or be required, to conduct recalls or send field alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals;\n\u2022additional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling, or changes to manufacturing processes, specifications and/or facilities may be required; and\n\u2022government investigations or lawsuits, including class-action lawsuits, may be brought against us.\nAny of the above occurrences could reduce or prevent sales of our COVID-19 vaccine, increase our expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize the vaccine.\nRisks related to the manufacturing of our commercial products, development candidates, investigational medicines and our future pipeline\nOur mRNA products, including our COVID-19 vaccine, development candidates and investigational medicines are based on novel technologies and are complex and difficult to manufacture. We or our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in manufacturing, product release, shelf life, testing, storage, supply chain management, or shipping for any of our medicines.\nThe manufacturing processes for our medicines, including our COVID-19 vaccine, are novel and complex. No mRNA medicine, other than COVID-19 vaccines, has been commercialized to date. Due to the novel nature of mRNA technology and our limited experience at larger scale production, we and our collaborators have experienced and may continue to encounter difficulties in manufacturing, product release, shelf life, testing, storage, supply chain management, or shipping. These issues could be due to many reasons, including complexities of producing batches at larger scale, equipment failure, human error, choice and quality of raw materials and excipients, analytical testing technology, and product instability. Further, mRNA medicines encapsulated in LNPs must be developed and manufactured under well-controlled conditions, or pharmacological activity can be adversely impacted.\nIn an effort to optimize product features, we have in the past and may in the future make changes to our development candidates or investigational medicines in their manufacturing and stability formulation and conditions. This has in the past and may in the future result in our having to resupply batches for preclinical or clinical activities when there is insufficient product stability during storage and insufficient supply. Insufficient stability or shelf life of our development candidates and investigational medicines could materially delay our or our strategic collaborators\u2019 ability to continue the clinical trial for that development candidate or investigational medicine or require us to begin a new clinical trial with a newly formulated drug product, due to the need to manufacture additional preclinical or clinical supply.\nOur rate of innovation is high, which has resulted in and will continue to cause a high degree of technology change that can negatively impact product comparability during and after clinical development. Furthermore, technology changes may drive the need for changes in, modification to, or the sourcing of new manufacturing infrastructure or may adversely affect third-party relationships.\nIn many cases, we may need to utilize multiple batches of drug substance and drug product to meet the clinical supply requirement of a single clinical trial. Failure in our ability to scale up batch size or failure in any batch may lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials or in the commercialization of any approved product. For example, the changes we make as we continue developing new manufacturing processes for our drug substance and drug product may impact specification and stability of the drug product, and may lead to failure of batches, resulting in a substantial delay in delivery of commercial product or conduct of our clinical trials. Our mRNA investigational medicines may prove to have a stability profile that leads to a lower than desired shelf life of the final approved mRNA medicine. This poses risk in supply requirements, wasted stock, and higher cost of goods.\nWe are dependent on a number of equipment providers who are also implementing novel technology. Further, we have developed our own custom manufacturing equipment for certain of our medicines. If we encounter unexpected performance issues with such equipment, we could encounter delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply. Due to the number of different programs, we may have cross contamination of investigational medicines inside of our factories, CROs, suppliers, or in the clinic that affect the integrity of our investigational medicines.\nAs we scale the manufacturing output for commercial production and particular programs, we plan to continuously improve yield, purity, and the pharmaceutical properties of our commercial products, development candidates and investigational medicines from\nTable of Content\nIND-enabling studies through commercial launch, including shelf life stability, and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance. Because of continuous improvement in manufacturing processes, we may switch processes for a particular program during development. However, after a change in process, more time will be required for pharmaceutical property testing, such as 6 or 12 month stability testing. That may require resupplying clinical material or making additional cGMP batches to keep up with clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed.\nWe are utilizing a number of raw materials and excipients that have a single source of supply, are new to the pharmaceutical industry, and are being employed in a novel manner. Some of these raw materials and excipients have not been scaled to a level to support commercial supply and could experience unexpected manufacturing or testing failures, or supply shortages. Such issues with raw materials and excipients could cause delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply of our investigational medicines.\nWe have established a number of analytical assays, and may have to establish several more, to assess the quality of our mRNA investigational medicines. We may identify gaps in our analytical testing strategy that might prevent release of product or could require product withdrawal or recall. For example, we may discover new impurities that have an impact on product safety, efficacy, or stability. This may lead to an inability to release mRNA investigational medicines until the manufacturing or testing process is rectified.\nAs our drug development pipeline increases and matures, the increased demand for clinical and commercial supplies from our facilities and third parties may impact our ability to operate. We rely on many service providers, all of whom have inherent risks in their operations that may adversely impact our operations.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our vaccine candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture our vaccine candidates at sufficient yields and at commercial-scale. We have limited experience manufacturing any of our vaccine candidates in the volumes that are necessary to support large-scale clinical trials or commercial sales. Efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling, scale-up, reproducibility, yield, purity, cost, potency or quality. If we are unable to institute necessary controls related to product development, manufacturing and quality, our operations may be adversely impacted. In addition, other companies, many with substantial resources, compete with us for access to the materials needed to manufacture our vaccines.\nWe currently utilize, and expect to continue to utilize, third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials, components, parts, and consumables, and to perform quality testing. If the field of mRNA and other nucleic acid medicines continues to expand, we may encounter increasing competition for these materials and services. Demand for third-party manufacturing or testing facilities may grow at a faster rate than their existing capacity, which could disrupt our ability to find and retain third-party manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of such raw materials, components, parts, and consumables required to manufacture our mRNA investigational medicines. The use of service providers and suppliers could expose us to risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022termination or non-renewal of supply and service agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u2022disruptions to the operations of these suppliers and service providers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the supplier or service provider; and\n\u2022inspections of third-party facilities by regulatory authorities that could have a negative outcome and result in delays to or termination of their ability to supply our requirements.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control. Because of contractual restraints and the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our bulk vaccines on a commercial scale, replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time-consuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our vaccine. A third-party manufacturer may also encounter difficulties in production, including:\n\u2022difficulties with production costs, scale up and yields;\n\u2022availability of raw materials and supplies;\n\u2022quality control and assurance;\n\u2022shortages of qualified personnel;\n\u2022compliance with strictly enforced regulations that vary in each country where products might be sold; and\n\u2022lack of capital funding.\nAny delay or interruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTable of Content\nWe are subject to operational risks associated with the physical and digital infrastructure at both our internal manufacturing facilities and at those of our external service providers.\nOur MTC facility in Norwood, Massachusetts incorporates a significant level of automation of equipment with integration of several digital systems to improve efficiency of operations. Our high level of digitalization may pose risk of process equipment malfunction and even overall manufacturing system failure or shutdown due to internal or external factors including, but not limited to, design issues, system compatibility, or potential cybersecurity breaches.\nOur facilities or those of our contract manufacturers may also be subject to intentional attacks or acts of sabotage by outside actors, contractors or employees. Any disruption in our or our contract manufacturers\u2019 manufacturing capabilities could cause delays in production capacity for our drug substances or products or a shutdown of facilities, could impose additional costs, or may require us to identify, qualify, and establish an alternative manufacturing site, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nAs we expand our development and commercial capacities, we have and expect that we will continue to establish additional manufacturing capabilities inside the MTC footprint and that we will expand to other locations and geographies, such as Africa, Australia and Canada. This expansion may lead to regulatory delays or prove more costly than anticipated. If we fail to select a suitable location, complete construction in an efficient manner, engage effectively with local regulators, recruit the required personnel, and generally manage our growth effectively, the development and production of commercial products or our investigational medicines could be delayed or curtailed. We expect that we will continue to make additional investments in our manufacturing processes as we expand the MTC and our other manufacturing infrastructure.\nOur products and investigational medicines are sensitive to shipping and storage conditions, which, in some cases, requires cold-chain logistics and subjects our investigational medicines to risk of loss or damage.\nOur COVID-19 vaccine and our investigational medicines are sensitive to temperature, storage, and handling conditions, and we could lose medicines if the product or product intermediates are not stored or handled properly. Shelf life for our products and investigational medicines is expected to be variable, and our investigational medicines may expire prior to use. Cold-chain logistics are required for certain of our investigational medicines and our COVID-19 vaccine. If we or third-party distributors do not maintain effective cold-chain supply logistics, then we may experience an unusual number of returned or out of date products and critical batches of products may be rendered unusable. This has in the past and could in the future lead to additional manufacturing costs and delays in our ability to supply required quantities for clinical trials, commercial sale, or otherwise. In addition, the cost associated with such transportation services and the limited pool of vendors could cause supply disruptions.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to manufacturing our COVID-19 vaccine and our mRNA investigational medicines. Our manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers may not meet regulatory requirements. Failure to meet cGMP requirements set forth in regulations promulgated by the FDA, EMA, and other global health authorities could result in significant delays in any approval of and costs of our products.\nThe manufacturing of medicines for clinical trials or commercial sale is subject to extensive regulation, and components of such products must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements, which are enforced, in the case of the FDA, in part through its facilities inspection program. The regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of products and materials used in clinical trials. Poor control of the cGMP production processes can lead to product quality failures that can impact our ability to supply product, resulting in cost overruns and delays to clinical timelines, which could be extensive. Such production process issues include but are not limited to:\n\u2022critical deviations in the manufacturing process;\n\u2022facility and equipment failures;\n\u2022contamination of the product due to an ineffective quality control strategy;\n\u2022facility contamination as assessed by the facility and utility environmental monitoring program;\n\u2022raw material failures due to ineffective supplier qualification or regulatory compliance issues at critical suppliers;\n\u2022ineffective product stability;\n\u2022ineffective corrective actions or preventative actions taken to correct or avoid critical deviations due to our developing understanding of the manufacturing process as we scale; and\n\u2022failed or defective components or consumables.\nRegulatory authorities typically require representative manufacturing site inspections to assess adequate compliance with cGMP and manufacturing controls. If we or one of our third-party manufacturing sites fails to provide sufficient quality assurance or control, the product approval to commercialize may not be granted. Inspections by regulatory authorities may occur at any time during the\nTable of Content\ndevelopment or commercialization phase of products. The inspections may be product specific or facility specific for broader cGMP inspections, or as a follow up to market or development issues that the regulatory agency may identify. Deficient inspection outcomes may negatively impact the ability of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers to fulfill their supply obligations, impacting or delaying supply or delaying programs.\nThe manufacturing process for our COVID-19 vaccine, and for any other products that we may develop, is subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to reliably produce products or investigational medicines to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we or our strategic collaborators may not obtain or maintain the approvals needed to commercialize such products. Even if regulatory approval is obtained for any of our mRNA medicines, there is no assurance that either we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture the approved medicine to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our investigational medicines, impair commercialization efforts, or increase our cost of goods, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, we may not have direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance, and qualified personnel. Our contract manufacturers supply or manufacture materials or products for other companies, and their failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements may generally affect the regulatory status of their facilities. In addition, to the extent that we rely on foreign contract manufacturers, including for our COVID-19 vaccine, we are subject to additional risks, including the need to comply with import and export regulations. Additionally, our potential future dependence on others to manufacture our investigational medicines and raw materials may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nThe FDA, the EMA, and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit product samples of any lot of any approved product, together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests, at any time. In some cases, regulators may prohibit us from distributing a lot or lots until it authorizes release. Deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may cause unacceptable changes in the product, resulting in lot failures or product recalls. Our third-party contract manufacturers have experienced lot failures and one has experienced a product recall related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Lot failures have in the past caused, and lot failures or product recalls in the future with respect to product produced by either our own or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities could cause, us and our strategic collaborators to delay clinical trials or product launches, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe and our manufacturing partners also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control, and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes and operations or those of our manufacturing partners, which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may not be able to control for or ultimately detect intentional sabotage or negligence by any employee or contractor.\nOur PCV investigational medicine is uniquely manufactured for each patient using a novel, complex manufacturing process and we may encounter difficulties in production.\nWe custom design and manufacture PCVs that are unique and tailored specifically for each patient. Manufacturing unique lots of PCVs is susceptible to product loss or failure due to issues with:\n\u2022logistics associated with the collection of a patient\u2019s tumor, blood, or other tissue sample;\n\u2022shipping such samples to a facility for genetic sequencing;\n\u2022next generation sequencing of the tumor mRNA;\n\u2022identification of appropriate tumor-specific mutations;\n\u2022the use of a software program, including proprietary and open source components, which is hosted in the cloud and a part of our investigational medicine, to assist with the design of the patient-specific mRNA, which software must be maintained and secured;\n\u2022effective design of the patient-specific mRNA that encodes for the required neoantigens;\n\u2022batch specific manufacturing failures or issues that arise due to the uniqueness of each patient-specific batch;\n\u2022quality control testing failures;\n\u2022unexpected failures of batches placed on stability;\n\u2022shortages or quality control issues with single-use assemblies, consumables, or critical parts sourced from third-party vendors that must be changed out for each patient-specific batch;\n\u2022significant costs associated with individualized manufacturing that may adversely affect our ability to continue development;\n\u2022successful and timely manufacture and release of the patient-specific batch;\n\u2022shipment issues encountered during transport of the batch to the patient site of care; and\nTable of Content\n\u2022the ability to define a consistent safety profile at a given dose when each participant receives a unique vaccine.\nWe have built and installed custom manufacturing equipment for PCVs that has been incorporated into a personalized vaccine unit in the MTC. This equipment may not function as designed, resulting in deviations in the drug product produced, which could lead to increased batch failure and the inability to supply patients enrolled in the clinical trial. If our clinical development plans are expanded, due to the custom nature of the equipment and single-use assemblies, we may require significant investments. In addition, it would take considerable time to scale up our facilities or build new facilities to meet any commercial demand if our PCV product is approved. This expansion or addition of new facilities could also lead to product comparability issues, which could further delay introduction of new capacity.\nBecause our PCVs are manufactured for each individual patient, we are required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to each patient\u2019s tissue sample, sequence data derived from such tissue sample, results of analysis of such patient\u2019s genomic analysis, and the custom manufactured product for each patient. Maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex, and failure to do so has in the past and may in the future result in product mix up, adverse patient outcomes, loss of product, or regulatory action including withdrawal of any approved products from the market. Further, as our PCV is developed through early-stage clinical trials to later-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, we expect that multiple aspects of the complicated collection, analysis, manufacture, and delivery process will be modified in an effort to optimize processes and results. These changes may not achieve the intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our PCVs to perform differently than we expect, potentially affecting the results of clinical trials.\nRisks related to our reliance on third parties\nWe are dependent on single-source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in, and the processes required to develop, our products, development candidates and investigational medicines.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in, and manufacturing processes required to develop and commercialize, our COVID-19 vaccine, development candidates and investigational medicines. We cannot ensure that these suppliers will remain in business, have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs, or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that will cease working with us. Our use of single-source suppliers exposes us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases, or late deliveries. Any disruption in supply from any single-source supplier could lead to supply delays or interruptions that would damage our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThere are, in general, relatively few alternative sources of supply for substitute components. If we have to switch to a replacement supplier, the manufacture and delivery of our products, development candidates or investigational medicines could be interrupted for an extended period, which could adversely affect our business. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or processes used in our products or investigational medicines, if required, may not be accomplished quickly, if at all. Any replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval, resulting in further delay. Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand for our investigational medicines. Additionally, as part of the FDA\u2019s approval of our investigational medicines, the FDA will review the individual components of our process, which include the manufacturing processes and facilities of our single-source suppliers.\nWe have in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, strategic alliances with third parties for the development and commercialization of our and their products, development candidates and investigational medicines. If these strategic alliances are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators have provided, and may in the future provide, funding and other resources for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our investigational medicines. Additionally, as we have begun to generate revenue, we have begun to enter into strategic alliances where we agree to provide funding and other resources to third parties. We expect to enter into additional strategic alliances in the future. Our existing strategic alliances, and any future strategic alliances we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022strategic collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022the clinical trials conducted as part of such strategic alliance may not be successful;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any investigational medicines that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization of programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the strategic collaborators\u2019 focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\nTable of Content\n\u2022strategic collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for clinical trials, stop a clinical trial, abandon an investigational medicine, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of an investigational medicine for clinical testing;\n\u2022strategic collaborators could develop, independently or with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or investigational medicines if such collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022products or investigational medicines developed in strategic alliances with us may be viewed by our strategic collaborators as competitive with their own investigational medicines or products, which may cause strategic collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our investigational medicines;\n\u2022a strategic collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our products or investigational medicines that achieve regulatory approval may commit insufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product;\n\u2022disagreements with strategic collaborators, including over proprietary rights, contract interpretation, or the course of development of any investigational medicines, may cause delays or termination of the research, development, or commercialization of such investigational medicines, lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such investigational medicines, or result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our IP rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our IP or proprietary information;\n\u2022disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of IP developed pursuant to our strategic alliances;\n\u2022strategic collaborators may infringe the IP rights of third parties, exposing us to potential litigation and liability;\n\u2022future relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business;\n\u2022we could face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex; and\n\u2022our international operations through any future collaborations, acquisitions, or joint ventures may expose us to certain operating, legal, and other risks not encountered in the United States.\nOur strategic collaborators generally may materially amend or terminate their agreements with us for convenience, which has happened in the past. If any collaboration agreement is terminated, we may not receive future research funding or milestone, earn-out royalty or other contingent payments, and the development of our investigational medicines may be delayed. It may also be difficult to attract new strategic collaborators to continue development or commercialization of the applicable investigational medicine, and the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval, and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K apply to the activities of our strategic collaborators.\nWe may seek to establish additional strategic alliances and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans. Certain of our strategic alliance agreements may restrict our ability to develop certain products.\nOur development programs and the potential commercialization of our development candidates and investigational medicines will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We may collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of some of our investigational medicines, and we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators. Our ability to establish additional strategic alliances will depend, among other things, on our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed strategic alliance, and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject investigational medicine, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such investigational medicine to trial participants, the potential of competing drugs, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. Any potential strategic collaborator may ultimately collaborate on alternative investigational medicines or technologies for similar indications rather than collaborate with us.\nWe are also restricted under our existing strategic alliance agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential strategic collaborators to pursue other targets on our own. These restrictions on working with targets, polypeptides, routes of administration, and fields could limit our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with other collaborators or to pursue certain potentially valuable development candidates or investigational medicines.\nStrategic alliances are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. If we cannot negotiate and enter into new strategic alliances on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, we may need to curtail the development of the investigational medicine for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and\nTable of Content\nundertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. We may need to obtain additional capital to fund these efforts, and the inability to obtain such funding on favorable terms may prevent us from further developing our investigational medicines or bringing them to market and generating product revenue.\nWe rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our research, preclinical studies, protocol development, and clinical trials for our development candidates and investigational medicines. If these third parties do not perform satisfactorily, comply with regulatory requirements, or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our investigational medicines and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on third parties such as CROs to help manage certain preclinical work and our clinical trials, and on medical institutions, clinical investigators and CROs to assist in the design and review of, and to conduct, our clinical trials, including enrolling qualified patients. In addition, we engage third-party contractors and collaborators to support numerous other research, commercial and administrative activities, which reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities, such as ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocols. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GLPs and good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that in the case of clinical trials the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Such standards will evolve and subject us and third parties to new or changing requirements.\nIf third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may need to replace them, which could cause a delay of the affected clinical trial, drug development program or applicable activity. If clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities may significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of such trials or even require a clinical trial to be redone. Accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed. In addition, failure of any third-party contractor to conduct activities in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect the relevant research, development, commercial or administrative activity.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries, or protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our ability to effectively compete using our development candidates will be harmed.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other IP laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until the patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, including our COVID-19 vaccine. For this and other reasons, we may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing exclusivity. Further, we may be required to obtain licenses under third-party patents to market our proposed products or conduct our research and development or other activities. If licenses are not available to us on favorable terms, we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities.\nThe process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming and our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent applications may fail to result in valid enforceable patents, or our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated, for non-compliance with these requirements. If we or our present or future strategic collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected.\nDespite our and our strategic collaborators\u2019 efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. While issued patents are presumed valid, they may not survive a validity challenge and could be held unenforceable. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated, adjudged unenforceable, or circumvented by parties seeking to design around our IP. Also, third parties or the USPTO may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any challenge to, finding of unenforceability or invalidation, or circumvention of, our patents or patent applications, would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management, could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from third-party licensors, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nTable of Content\nThe standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Similarly, the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions, including ours, in the United States and foreign countries, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices, courts, and lawmakers. For example, the America Invents Act, which took effect in March 2013, included a number of changes to the patent laws of the United States. If any of the enacted changes prevent us from adequately protecting our discoveries, including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents to obtain injunctive relief or for substantial damages, our business could be adversely affected. One major provision of the America Invents Act changed U.S. patent practice from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file system. If we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention, we no longer have the ability to provide proof that we were in possession of the invention prior to the competitor\u2019s filing date, and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. In certain countries, for example, methods for the medical treatment of humans are not patentable.\nAccordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. We also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets, know-how, and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We also rely on non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees, consultants, and third parties. If any trade secret, know-how, or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain and maintain all available regulatory exclusivities and broad patent scope and to maximize patent term restoration or extension on patents covering our products may lead to loss of exclusivity and early biosimilar entry resulting in a loss of market share and/or revenue.\nIn addition, we may choose not to enforce our IP rights in certain circumstances or for certain periods of time. For example, in October 2020 we announced that while the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we will not enforce our COVID-19-related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic. We also noted that to eliminate any perceived IP barriers to vaccine development during the pandemic period, upon request we are also willing to license our IP for COVID-19 vaccines to others for the post-pandemic period. However, we may never enter into such licenses of our IP for the post-pandemic period, and our business may be otherwise adversely impacted by our decision not to enforce this IP.\nUncertainty over IP in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable, and can have adverse financial and freedom-to-operate consequences.\nmRNA medicines are a relatively new scientific field and, as the field continues to mature, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as patent infringement lawsuits, interference, reexamination, and opposition proceedings, as well as inter-partes and post-grant-review proceedings introduced by provisions of the America Invents Act, in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the mRNA field.\nWe have issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key markets around the world that claim many different methods, compositions, and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture, and commercialization of mRNA medicines and our delivery technology, including LNPs. An opposition has been filed against one of our European platform patents covering uridine-modified mRNAs and we expect that further oppositions will be filed in the European Patent Office (EPO) and elsewhere relating to patents and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims. We cannot be certain that such patent will survive or that the claims will remain in the current form. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our IP rights.\nThere are many issued and pending third-party patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide and delivery technologies that we may need for our mRNA therapeutic and vaccine candidates or marketed products, including our COVID-19 vaccine. There are also many issued third-party patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for mRNA medicines we wish to develop. For example, there are issued and pending patent applications that may be asserted against us in a court proceeding or otherwise based upon the asserting party\u2019s belief that we may need such patents for our mRNA therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations hold patent rights to which we may need a license or which could be asserted against us. If those organizations refuse to license such patent rights on reasonable terms or a court rules that we need such patent rights that have\nTable of Content\nbeen asserted against us and we are not able to obtain a license on reasonable terms, we may owe damages to such party, and further may be unable to market products, including our COVID-19 vaccine, covered by such patents.\nIn certain instances, we have instituted and may in the future institute inter partes review proceedings against issued U.S. patents and opposition proceedings against European patents owned by third parties in the field of mRNA medicines. We have a number of these proceedings ongoing against third-party patents related to RNA vaccinations and mRNA delivery. If we are unsuccessful in invalidating such third-party patents, those third parties may attempt to assert those patents against investigational medicines that obtain regulatory approval, including our COVID-19 vaccine. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our development candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nIf we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages, or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts.\nThere may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our investigational medicines, and third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our technologies infringe upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our investigational medicines, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to commercialize such investigational medicine unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture, or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable investigational medicine unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires.\nDefense of infringement and other claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and divert employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products, or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be made available on commercially favorable terms, if at all, or may require substantial time and expense.\nIn addition, any such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability, which could jeopardize our ability to sustain our operations. Moreover, we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our IP may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior IP positions in the relevant fields, which could result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations.\nIn addition, in connection with certain license and strategic alliance agreements, we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to IP rights or the subject matter of the agreements. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to IP rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could delay our research, development and commercialization efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf third-party owners of any patent rights that we license do not properly or successfully obtain, maintain, or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed.\nWe may become a party to licenses that give us rights to third-party IP that is necessary or useful for our business. In such a case, our success may depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our licensed IP. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications we license. Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the IP we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. In addition, we sublicense our rights under various third-party licenses to our strategic collaborators. Any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenues under our strategic alliance agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our strategic collaborators.\nTable of Content\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license IP rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe license IP, which involves complex legal, business, and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. We are a party to certain IP license agreements and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license and may be subject to additional liabilities.\nIn certain cases, we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our strategic collaborators. Disputes may arise regarding IP subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u2022the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022whether our technology and processes that are not subject to the licensing agreement infringe on IP of the licensor;\n\u2022the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of IP by our licensors and us and our strategic collaborators; and\n\u2022the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over IP that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on favorable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected development candidates or investigational medicines. We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of IP that we license as we are for IP that we own. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this IP, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. From time to time, we are subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, or independent contractors, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed IP, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of third parties, including our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable IP rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other IP.\nWe may be and have been subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other IP. Ownership disputes may arise, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our development candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable IP rights, including exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable IP. Such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management and other employees, and could impact or patenting strategy.\nChanges in U.S. patent and regulatory law could impair our ability to protect our products.\nOur success is heavily dependent on IP, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and the process is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has enacted and is implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. These rulings have increased uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, as well as with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. See \u201c-Risks related to the research, development, regulatory review, and\nTable of Content\napproval of our existing and future pipeline-Our investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\u201d\nWe may not be able to protect our IP rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on development candidates and investigational medicines in every country would be prohibitively expensive, and our foreign IP rights can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect IP rights to the same extent as U.S. federal and state laws. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own products in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection or may export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending IP rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other IP protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our IP rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the IP that we develop or license.\nAdditionally, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. As a result, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that certain countries may take steps to facilitate compulsory licenses that permit the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine in those countries. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the relevant patent rights. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on government funding and collaboration from governmental and quasi-governmental entities for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of development, commercialization and production of any programs developed under those government-funded programs.\nThe development of our Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893) is funded by BARDA and our COVID-19 vaccine was developed in collaboration with NIAID. BARDA has agreed to fund the advancement of our COVID-19 vaccine to FDA licensure. Contracts and grants funded by the U.S. government and its agencies, including our agreements funded by BARDA and DARPA and our collaboration with NIAID, include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u2022terminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022reduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022claim rights, including IP rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u2022audit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022suspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u2022suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n\u2022control and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n\u2022pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act, and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u2022limit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the\nTable of Content\nU.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants, and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants, normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n\u2022mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022public disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u2022mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination, and affirmative action programs, and environmental compliance requirements.\nFurther, under these agreements we are subject to the obligations to and the rights of the U.S. government set forth in the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act). As a result, the U.S. government may have rights in certain inventions developed under these government-funded programs, including a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or nonexclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations, also referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights.\u201d Any exercise of the march-in rights by the U.S. government could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. If the U.S. government exercises such march-in rights, we may receive compensation that is deemed reasonable by the U.S. government in its sole discretion, which may be less than what we might be able to obtain in the open market. IP generated under a government-funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources.\nIn addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying any invention generated through the use of U.S. government-funding be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the IP can show that it made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers for products covered by such IP.\nAs an organization, we are relatively new to government contracting and the related regulatory compliance obligations. If we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations, we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the U.S. government of our costs and performance on their contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices related to these contracts. Based on the results of its audits, the government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. We cannot assure you that future audits and reviews will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks related to the commercialization of our pipeline\nWe have limited sales, distribution, and marketing experience, and have only recently invested significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities. If we cannot effectively establish such capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products or to help ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements, our ability to generate revenues may be adversely affected.\nOur COVID-19 vaccine is our only commercial product, and we are investing in the development of sales, marketing, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities in and out of the United States, both on our own and with others. We may seek to enter into strategic alliances with other entities to utilize their marketing and distribution capabilities, but may be unable to enter into agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If we rely on third parties to commercialize any approved product, we will receive lower revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves. In addition, we may have little or no control over the sales efforts of such third parties. If our collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our products, and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own, we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business.\nThe commercialization and distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine also subjects us to pharmacovigilance obligations under various regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions where our vaccine is distributed. These regulations generally require us to collect, process,\nTable of Content\nanalyze and monitor safety data and to identify and evaluate adverse reactions to our vaccine as it is administered in those jurisdictions. We partner with third-party organizations to assist us in collecting and processing this safety data as it is reported from healthcare providers, vaccine recipients and others. If we or these third parties cannot comply with relevant regulations, including with respect to the timely processing of safety data, we may be subject to sanctions, increased costs, and reputational harm, or our authorizations to distribute our vaccine in the relevant jurisdiction may be revoked or curtailed. There are a limited number of third-party service providers who are qualified and capable of providing pharmacovigilance services on a global basis, and our inability to identify or contract with them may impede our commercial activities.\nWe compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing, sales and pharmacovigilance operations, and we must also compete with such companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel. We also incur expenses associated with hiring third-party contractors to assist in conducting local pharmacovigilance services. Without a significant internal team or the support of a third party to perform these functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nThe terms of certain of our supply agreements may require us to refund certain prepayments from customers of our COVID-19 vaccine if they reduce purchase commitments or if we fail to deliver the purchased volume.\nSome customers for our COVID-19 vaccine prepay us for a portion of the product payment for the vaccine doses that they expect to receive from us. Such prepayments can be substantial. We are generally not required by our contracts to retain these prepayments in cash or otherwise and we generally use them to make capital expenditures and fund the manufacturing scale-up and commercialization of our vaccine. Under certain supply agreements, if we fail to deliver a portion or all of the committed number of doses by a certain date, or if we are unable to successfully obtain regulatory authorization or approval for the commercialization of the vaccine in the relevant jurisdiction, a customer may reduce the volume of vaccine doses that it commits to purchase or terminate the contract. Upon termination, we would generally be required to refund a portion of that customer\u2019s prepayment. We may not have the cash or other available resources to satisfy that repayment obligation. In this situation, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, if customers do not prepay us for our services in the future, we may have to find other sources of funding, which may not be available when needed or on acceptable terms.\nThe commercial success of any current or future investigational medicine, if approved, will depend on the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEthical, social, and legal concerns about genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use, including new areas of research such as in gene editing. Additionally, the commercial success of our products will depend in part on the medical community, patients, and third-party or governmental payors accepting mRNA medicines, and our products in particular, as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. The degree of market acceptance of our investigational medicines, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022the potential efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022the ability to offer our products, if approved, at competitive prices;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations, restrictions (including for use together with other medicines) or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects resulting from checkpoint inhibitors or other products or therapies with which our products are co-administered;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try, and physicians to prescribe, new therapies;\n\u2022the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement, and patients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will be unknown until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of the products may require significant resources, especially due to the complexity and uniqueness of our programs, and may never be successful.\nTable of Content\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nBecause we market our COVID-19 vaccine, and plan to market other products, if approved, and to conduct manufacturing activities outside of the United States, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. We have limited experience as a company operating outside the United States. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our developmental candidates or investigational medicines before we receive regulatory approval or other authorization from an applicable authority, and we may never receive such approval for any of our developmental candidates or investigational medicines. To obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our developmental candidates and investigational medicines, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions. We are rapidly expanding our global operations, establishing commercial subsidiaries, and entering into arrangements to support the worldwide manufacture and distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine and other medicines, including with third parties, which is a complex task that we are undertaking on an accelerated timeline. Accordingly, our business and financial results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors associated with our expanding global business, including:\n\u2022efforts to develop an international commercial sales, marketing, and supply chain and distribution organization, including efforts to mitigate longer accounts receivable collection times, longer lead times for shipping, and potential language barriers; for example, in the second half of 2021, we felt the impact of longer delivery lead times for international shipments and exports, which shifted certain anticipated deliveries of our COVID-19 vaccine from 2021 to 2022;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets;\n\u2022our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u2022different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022an increased legal and compliance burden to establish, maintain and operate legal entities in foreign countries;\n\u2022the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements, including the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR);\n\u2022the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute, and the difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions, and the existence of potentially relevant third-party IP rights;\n\u2022inadequate IP protection in foreign countries, and the existence of potentially relevant third-party IP rights;\n\u2022trade-protection measures including trade restrictions, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and fines, penalties, or suspension or revocation of export privileges, the imposition of government controls, and changes in tariffs;\n\u2022the effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are also subject to extensive federal, state and foreign anti-bribery regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in other countries. Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. As we expand our presence outside the United States, we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nWe cannot guarantee that we, or our employees, consultants, or third-party contractors, are or will be in compliance with all federal, state, and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption. Moreover, our strategic collaborators and third-party contractors outside the United States may have inadequate compliance programs or fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate, which may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTable of Content\nSales of pharmaceutical products depends on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nThird-party payor coverage and reimbursement for our COVID-19 vaccine is not currently available and there is no guarantee payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for the vaccine in the future. Even if coverage is provided, we may not be able to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. While coverage is expected to be provided under Medicare Part B, it is unclear to what extent other payors, including certain federal entitlement programs, such as the Vaccines for Children Program, will provide coverage for the product. Additionally, it is uncertain whether any combination respiratory vaccine we develop, if approved, would qualify for coverage under Medicare Part B.\nIn addition, sales of pharmaceutical products in general depends, to a significant extent, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payors. When a new product is approved, the availability and extent of government and private reimbursement, and the pricing, for that product may be uncertain. Pricing and reimbursement for any product we develop may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in, and implementation of, federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies;\n\u2022pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs; and\n\u2022consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value.\nOur ability to set the price for any product we develop will vary significantly from country to country. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country may limit the revenues from our products within that country and adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, which may limit market growth. This may create the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues.\nDrug prices are under significant scrutiny in many countries. We expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. Competition may negatively impact our ability to maintain pricing and our market share. New products marketed by competitors could cause our revenues to decrease due to potential price reductions and lower sales volumes. Additionally, the introduction of competing versions of our products or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways may reduce the price that we are able to charge for our products and lower our sales volume.\nMany payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, including more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients\u2019 use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs. Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is: a covered benefit under its health plan; safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; and neither experimental nor investigational.\nAdditionally, target patient populations for some of our investigational medicines, including for rare genetic diseases, may be small, and some of our investigational medicines, like PCV, require individual customization. The pricing and reimbursement of our medicines, if approved, must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure. If we cannot obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, we may be unable to successfully market and sell our investigational medicines. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our investigational medicines (e.g., for administration of our product to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues and results of operations.\nRecent federal legislation and actions by federal, state and local governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nTable of Content\nWe may face competition in the United States for our development candidates and investigational medicines, if approved, from therapies sourced from foreign countries with price controls on pharmaceutical products. For example, in October 2020, the FDA published a final rule that would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada, where there are government price controls. Since the issuance of the final rule, several industry groups filed federal lawsuits requesting injunctive relief to prevent the rule from taking effect and challenging multiple aspects of the final rule. This litigation has not progressed and the market implications are currently unknown, but legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and potential profitability.\nHealthcare legislative reform discourse and potential or enacted measures may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and legislative or political discussions surrounding the desire for and implementation of pricing reforms may adversely impact our business.\nIn the United States, federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals, enactments to reform health care insurance programs and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the manner in which our products, if approved, are prescribed and purchased. For example, provisions of the ACA have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the PHSA. See the section titled \"Business-Government Regulation-Current and future healthcare reform legislation.\"\nWe may face uncertainties as a result of efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. There is no assurance that the ACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere is increasing public attention on the costs of prescription drugs and there have been, and are expected to continue to be, legislative proposals to address prescription drug pricing, which could have significant effects on our business. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the ACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nThere is also significant economic pressure on state budgets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the United States and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products, if approved.\nIn the EU and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures, and may in the future implement new or additional measures, to reduce health care costs to limit the overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIf the market opportunities for our programs, development candidates or investigational medicines are smaller than we believe they are, or we are unable to successfully identify clinical trial participants, our revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe focus certain of our research and product development activities on treatments for severe rare genetic diseases, where the patient populations are difficult to ascertain or small. Additionally, we expect to initially seek approval of our PCV and intratumoral immuno-oncology investigational medicines for use by patients with relapsed or refractory advanced disease, i.e., the populations the FDA often approves new therapies for initially. If any such medicines prove to be sufficiently beneficial, we would expect to seek approval in earlier lines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy. There is no guarantee that our investigational medicines, even if approved, would be approved for earlier lines of therapy, and, prior to any such approvals, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials.\nTable of Content\nOur projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of those who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our investigational medicines, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of trial participants, both in and outside the United States, may be lower than expected and potential clinical trial participants or patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our investigational medicines or products, or new clinical trial participants or patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Even if we obtain significant market share for our products, if approved, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or stolen versions of mRNA products, or the unauthorized donation or re-sale of mRNA products, could have a negative impact on our financial performance or reputation.\nThird parties could illegally distribute and sell, especially online, counterfeit versions of mRNA products that do not meet the rigorous cGMP manufacturing and testing standards. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and could be life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances or the wrong dose. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nReports of adverse reactions to counterfeit products, increased levels of counterfeiting, or unsafe mRNA products could materially affect patient confidence in our mRNA products. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit or other non-mRNA products will mistakenly be attributed to our mRNA products. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation, and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity in mRNA products as a result of counterfeiting, theft, or improper manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurther, the unauthorized donation or resale of our product could adversely affect our ability to sell in a particular territory, and have other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks related to our finances\nWe have a limited history of recognizing revenue from product sales and may not be able to achieve or maintain long-term sustainable profitability.\nBefore the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred net losses in each year since our inception. Other than for our COVID-19 vaccine, we have not completed pivotal clinical trials for any of our programs, and it may be years for most of our investigational medicines, if ever, before we or our strategic collaborators have a product ready for commercialization. Our ability to generate revenue and maintain profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaborators, to successfully complete the development of and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our products and investigational medicines, including commercializing our COVID-19 vaccine, which is subject to numerous risks.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs associated with the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine and our clinical and preclinical development activities. We may not be able to achieve or maintain long-term sustainable profitability and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022continue or expand our research or development of our programs in preclinical development;\n\u2022initiate additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies for our development candidates and investigational medicines, including under our strategic alliance agreements;\n\u2022continue to invest in our platform to conduct research to identify novel mRNA technology improvements, including to identify methods of mRNA delivery, such as improvements to our LNPs;\n\u2022change or add to internal manufacturing capacity or capability, or additional manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022add additional infrastructure to our quality control and quality assurance groups to support our operations as we progress our investigational medicines toward commercialization;\n\u2022attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022create additional infrastructure to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, including new sites in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022seek marketing approvals and reimbursement for our investigational medicines;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products;\nTable of Content\n\u2022acquire or in-license other development candidates, investigational medicines, and technologies;\n\u2022make milestone or other payments under any in-license agreements; and\n\u2022experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our financing or funding ability as well as negatively impact our ability to exist as a standalone company.\nOur financial condition and operating results have varied in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. As such, a period-to-period comparison of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following, as well as other factors described in these Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u2022our ability to manufacture and deliver supply of our COVID-19 vaccine;\n\u2022variations in our financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022delays or failures in advancement of existing or future development candidates into the clinic or investigational medicines in clinical trials;\n\u2022the feasibility of developing, manufacturing, and commercializing our programs;\n\u2022the outcomes of research programs, clinical trials (including any adverse safety events), or other product development or approval processes conducted by us and our strategic collaborators;\n\u2022the timing of disclosure of any milestones related to any of our programs that are managed by our strategic collaborators or competitors;\n\u2022our ability to consistently manufacture our development candidates and investigational medicines;\n\u2022our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner; and\n\u2022our ability to obtain, protect, and enforce our IP rights, as well as our know-how and technologies.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $17.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, inflation and interest rate risks. We may realize losses in the fair value of these investments. In addition, if our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us, our interest income would suffer. These and other market risks associated with our investment portfolio may adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nRisks related to our business and operations\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing the development and expansion of our company, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,700 full-time employees and, in connection with the growth and advancement of our pipeline and commercialization of our company, we expect to increase the number of employees and the scope of our operations. To manage such development and expansion, including internationally, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, and financial systems, expand our facilities, and recruit and train qualified personnel. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities.\nWe are pursuing development candidates and investigational medicines in many therapeutic areas and across a wide range of diseases. Successfully developing products for and fully understanding the regulatory and manufacturing pathways to all of these therapeutic areas and diseases requires significant depth of talent, resources, and corporate processes in order to allow simultaneous execution across multiple areas. We may not be able to effectively manage this simultaneous execution and the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations, including the construction of the Moderna Science Center in Cambridge, the expansion of our Norwood campus and the construction of manufacturing facilities overseas, may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our investigational medicines. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to\nTable of Content\ncommercialize our COVID-19 vaccine, or our other investigational medicines, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company.\nOur failure to upgrade and maintain our enterprise resource planning system (ERP) could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are working to upgrade our global ERP system to support our anticipated future growth and expansion as a commercial operation. We expect to incur substantial costs in implementing our ERP system, and any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using our ERP system could adversely affect our controls, resulting in harm to our business, including our ability to forecast or make sales and collect our receivables. Significant delays in documenting, reviewing and testing our internal control could cause us to fail to comply with our SEC reporting obligations related to our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, such disruptions or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants, and advisors and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, technical, quality-control, manufacturing, medical and commercial personnel. We are highly dependent on members of our management and scientific teams. Each of our executive officers and employees, including key scientists and clinicians, are employed \u201cat will,\u201d meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time. The loss of any of these persons\u2019 services may adversely impact the achievement of our research, development, financing, and commercialization objectives. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees. Several of our key employees, including members of our executive team, have been with us for a long period of time, and have valuable, fully vested stock options or other long-term equity incentives. We may not be able to retain these employees due to the competitive environment in the biotechnology industry, particularly in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nIn addition, we rely on consultants, contractors, and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and commercialization strategies. These individuals may be employed by other employers and may have commitments under contracts with others that may limit their availability to us. The loss of the services of one or more of our current employees or advisors might impede the achievement of our research, development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and commercialization objectives. In addition, we have flexibly grown our workforce through the use of contractors and part time workers. If we cannot retain the services of such personnel, we could experience delays in the operation of our business.\nCompetition for skilled personnel, including in mRNA and LNP research, clinical operations, regulatory affairs, therapeutic area management, and manufacturing, is intense and the turnover rate is high. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel on favorable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for individuals with similar skill sets. In some instances, failure to attract and retain personnel could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, adverse publicity, failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical trials or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. We may also be unable to attract and retain highly qualified sales and marketing professionals to support our COVID-19 vaccine and any future products. The inability to recruit, or loss of services of certain executives, key employees, consultants, or advisors, may impede the progress of our research, development and global commercialization objectives and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe invest substantial time and resources in building and maintaining our culture and developing our personnel; however, as we continue to expand, it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, much of our workforce has worked remotely and we implemented remote hiring and onboarding programs to facilitate significant hiring during 2021 in a remote work environment. The dramatic growth of our workforce, coupled with shifts in workplace and workstyle, increase the risk of our ability to maintain culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively pursue our strategic plans.\nOur internal computer systems and physical premises, or those of third parties with which we share sensitive data or information, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could materially disrupt our product development programs and manufacturing operations.\nTable of Content\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators, vendors, contractors, consultants or regulatory authorities with whom we share sensitive data or information are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters (which may become more frequent in the future as a result of climate change), terrorism, cybersecurity threats, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, cyber-attacks on our information technology systems by threat actors of all types (including nation states, criminal enterprises, individual actors and/or advanced persistent threat groups). In addition, we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors. If any such cyber-attack or physical intrusion were to cause interruptions in our operations, such as a material disruption of our development programs or our manufacturing operations, or due to a loss of any of our proprietary information, it would have a material and adverse effect on us. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from one or more clinical trials could cause delays in our regulatory approval efforts and increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, because we run multiple clinical trials in parallel, any breach of our computer systems or physical premises may result in a loss of data or compromised data integrity across many of our programs in many stages of development. Our cybersecurity liability insurance may not cover all damages we would sustain based on any breach of our computer security protocols or cybersecurity attack.\nAny data breach, security incident loss, or compromise of personal information, including any clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties, or claims for damages either under the GDPR and relevant member state law in the EU, other foreign laws, and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States including the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA). We have from time to time received information that companies working on vaccine research and development may be a particular focus for those planning cyberattacks. For example, on May 13, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), announced that the FBI was investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by People\u2019s Republic of China, or PRC-affiliated cyber actors. Furthermore, on July 16, 2020, the National Security Agency and other U.S. and foreign agencies released a joint cybersecurity advisory regarding the Russian Intelligence Services\u2019 targeting of COVID-19 research and vaccine development. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including but not limited to information related to the research and manufacturing of our COVID-19 vaccine and/or other vaccines, we could incur liability, our competitive and reputational position could be harmed, and the further development and commercialization of our investigational medicines could be delayed. With respect to potential liability for breaches involving personal information, the CCPA is of particular concern since it provides for a private right of actions for certain personal information breaches.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or investigational medicine and fail to capitalize on programs or investigational medicines that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe pursue and fund the development of selected research programs or investigational medicines and may choose to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other programs or investigational medicines that could later prove to have greater commercial potential. For example, we have focused a significant amount of resources on our COVID-19 vaccine since the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our resource allocation decisions, or our contractual commitments to provide resources to our strategic collaborators, may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for investigational medicines may not yield commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular investigational medicine, we may relinquish valuable rights to that investigational medicine through a strategic alliance, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such investigational medicine, or we may allocate internal resources to an investigational medicine in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a strategic alliance.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, and commercializing additional products beyond our current portfolio, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nA key element of our strategy is to discover, develop, and potentially commercialize additional products beyond our current portfolio to treat various conditions and in a variety of therapeutic areas. We intend to do so by investing in our own drug discovery efforts, exploring potential strategic alliances for the development of new products, and in-licensing technologies. Identifying new investigational medicines requires substantial technical, financial, and human resources. We may fail to identify promising investigational medicines and, even if we do identify such medicines, we may fail to successfully develop and commercialize products for many reasons, including:\n\u2022competitors may develop alternatives that render our investigational medicines obsolete;\n\u2022investigational medicines we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022an investigational medicine may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\nTable of Content\n\u2022we may be incapable of producing an investigational medicine in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022an approved product may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional products, our potential for growth may be impaired.\nOur business could be harmed if we suffer damage to our reputation, including as a result of a product recall.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of certain commercialized products. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall of a biologic product must be based on an FDA finding that a batch, lot of other quantity of the biologic product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of any investigational medicine in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or our strategic collaborators could occur as a result of manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues, as occurred with the recall of certain batches of our COVID-19 vaccine shipped to Japan that were found to contain foreign particulate. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. Our reputation could be further impacted by public discourse regarding our business and the perception of our business strategy.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any product or investigational medicine that we may develop, such as our COVID-19 vaccine.\nWe are exposed to product liability risk related to the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of our COVID-19 vaccine and our investigational medicines in clinical trials. Product liability claims and related cross-claims and claims for indemnification may be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others using, prescribing, selling or otherwise coming into contact with our COVID-19 vaccine or investigational medicines. For example, we may be sued if the COVID-19 vaccine or any investigational medicine allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing, or, if approved, marketing, sale or commercial use. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.\nWe could also face product liability claims relating to the worsening of a patient\u2019s condition, injury or death alleged to have been caused by one of our COVID-19 vaccine or investigational medicines. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, including as a result of interactions with alcohol or other drugs, knowledge of risks, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Such claims might not be fully covered by product liability insurance. If we succeed in marketing products, including our COVID-19 vaccine, product liability claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs, and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or license revocation. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention, costs to defend the related litigation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, loss of revenue, a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to trial participants, patients or their family members, payments to indemnify clinical trial sites and other clinical trial partners, and a decline in our stock price.\nWe are also exposed to liabilities that are unique to developing and commercializing an mRNA vaccine during an ongoing global pandemic. Although the U.S. and certain foreign governments have contractually agreed to indemnify us or make statutory immunity available to us, such indemnification or statutory immunity may not be available to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from the research, development, manufacture, distribution or commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, other foreign government that we contract with in the future may not provide us with similar contractual indemnity or statutory immunity. Substantial claims arising from the vaccine outside the scope of or in excess of U.S. or foreign government indemnity or statutory immunity could harm our financial condition and operating results. Moreover, any adverse event or injury for which we are liable, even if fully covered under an indemnity or immunity, could negatively affect our reputation.\nWe may not be able to maintain our product liability insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. While our current insurance program includes coverage for the sale of commercial products for when we obtain marketing approval for our medicines, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in individual, mass tort and class-action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nTable of Content\nIf the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers. Additionally, even if we maintain insurance coverage for a type of liability, a particular claim may not be covered if it is subject to a coverage exclusion or we do not otherwise meet the conditions for coverage. If we operate our business with inadequate insurance, we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and false claims laws. If we cannot comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufacturers to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which such companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. See the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Other healthcare laws.\u201d\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, is time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company\u2019s attention from the business. If our operations are found to violate any of these laws or any other regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant sanctions, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, reputational harm, exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance. Furthermore, if any physician or other healthcare provider or entity with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar penalties. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of the business. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any product candidate we develop outside the United States will subject us to foreign healthcare laws.\nThe provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU and the U.K. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 in the U.K. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. The EU Directive (2001/83/EC, as amended) governing medicinal products for human use provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the U.K. despite its departure from the EU.\nPayments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often are the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization, or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.\nWe are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business, result in fines and/or criminal penalties, and damage our reputation.\nPrivacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate and/or collect personal information. We are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that apply to the collection, storage, use, sharing and security of personal data, including health information, and impose significant compliance obligations. In addition, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues.\nTable of Content\nFor example, the GDPR has imposed stringent obligations on us with respect to our processing personal data and the cross-border transfer of such data, including higher standards of obtaining consent, more robust transparency requirements, data breach notification requirements, requirements for contractual language with our data processors, and stronger individual data rights. Different EEA Member States have interpreted the GDPR differently and many have imposed additional requirements, adding to the complexity of processing personal data in the EEA. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA that are not considered to provide \u201cadequate\u201d protection to personal data, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any activities falling within the scope of the GDPR.\nIn the United States, California has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act and several other states and the federal government are actively considering proposed legislation governing the protection of personal data. Additionally, Brazil passed the General Data Protection Law, which went into effect in August 2020. Data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges. Each law is also subject to various interpretations by courts and regulatory agencies, creating additional uncertainty, and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful.\nWe must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with the changing landscape in this area. Failure to comply with data protection laws may expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by authorities, private rights of action in some jurisdictions, and potential significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. Failure to comply with the GDPR and applicable national data protection laws of EEA member states could lead to substantial fines. Some of these laws and regulations also carry the possibility of criminal sanctions. For example, we could be subject to penalties, including criminal penalties, if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered health care provider or research institution that has not complied with HIPAA\u2019s requirements for disclosing such information. Furthermore, the number of government investigations related to data security incidents and privacy violations continues to increase and government investigations typically require significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business and our reputation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has added further complexity to the processing of personal data. For example, safety measures intended to protect our employees, contractors, and other visitors to our sites may require the collection of certain personal data. Our efforts to protect personal data may be unsuccessful and we could unintentionally be subject to unauthorized access or disclosure of such personal data.\nThe Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (the Clinical Trial Regulation) and the EMA policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use both permit the EMA to publish clinical information submitted in MAAs. The ability of third parties to review and/or analyze data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of commercial confidentiality breaches and result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trial results. Such scrutiny could result in public misconceptions regarding our drugs and drug candidates. These publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our business.\nCertain aspects of our business may be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nCertain of our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in paused enrollment or delayed site initiations. Site initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis may be paused or delayed (or continue to be paused or delayed) due to changes in hospital or university policies, federal, state or local regulations or restrictions, prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic efforts, travel restrictions, concerns for patient safety in a pandemic environment, or other pandemic-related reasons. As the pandemic persists, some participants and clinical investigators may be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols. For example, many countries have implemented quarantines or travel limitations (whether voluntary or required), which may impede participant movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, and we may be unable to conduct our clinical trials.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the United States\u2019 healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems. Such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay the review and/or approval by the FDA and other regulatory agencies with respect to, our clinical trials or product approvals, which could materially delay our clinical trials for development candidates or our commercial efforts.\nWe utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials, components, parts, and consumables, perform quality testing and ship our products. We also manufacture our development candidates and investigational medicines and perform various services at our manufacturing facility. Certain of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers may encounter delays in providing their services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If either we or any third-party manufacturers or third parties in the supply chain for materials used in the production of our COVID-19 vaccine, development candidates or investigational medicines are adversely\nTable of Content\nimpacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture our COVID-19 vaccine, as well as investigational medicines for our clinical trials, research and development operations and commercialization. In addition, delays and disruptions experienced by our strategic collaborators due to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the ability of such parties to fulfill their obligations, which could affect the clinical development or regulatory approvals of development candidates and investigational medicines under joint control.\nIf we engage in acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic collaborations, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nWe may complete acquisitions and collaborations, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, IP rights, technologies, or businesses. Any such acquisition, joint venture, or collaboration may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u2022assimilation of operations, IP, and products, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives;\n\u2022the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u2022risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or investigational medicines and regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIf we undertake acquisitions, we may utilize our cash, issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses, and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, if we cannot locate suitable acquisition or strategic collaboration opportunities, our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business may be impaired.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates substantially, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nOur stock price has been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to substantial volatility. From December 7, 2018, our first day of trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, through December 31, 2021, our stock has traded within a range of a high price of $497.49 and a low price of $11.54 per share. Since we began our development efforts with respect to our COVID-19 vaccine in early 2020, our stock has experienced pronounced and extended periods of volatility. As a result of the volatility in our stock price, our stockholders could incur substantial losses.\nPublic statements by us, government agencies, the media, competitors, financial analysts, or others relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to combat it have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in significant fluctuations in our stock price. Given the global focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, information in the public arena on this topic, whether or not accurate, has had and will likely continue to have an outsized impact (positive or negative) on our stock price. Information related to our clinical trials, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization efforts with respect to our COVID-19 vaccine, or information regarding such efforts by competitors, or the evolution of the pandemic, may meaningfully impact our stock price.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above your initial purchase price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022the success of our COVID-19 vaccine sales and anticipated product revenue;\n\u2022results of clinical trials of our investigational medicines or those of our competitors;\n\u2022the success of competitive products or technologies, particularly vaccines or treatments for COVID-19;\n\u2022the emergence or decline of new or existing variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus;\n\u2022commencement or termination of strategic alliances;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents, or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022expenses related to any of our products, investigational medicines or clinical development programs;\n\u2022the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire, or in-license additional investigational medicines;\nTable of Content\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in estimates of financial results, development timelines, or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022general economic, industry, and market conditions;\n\u2022the numerous programs in our pipeline, the development of which could each generate news or significant adverse events that could impact financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022public announcements by us or our strategic collaborators regarding the progress of our development candidates or investigational medicines or similar public announcements by our competitors.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation often has been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and prospects.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of February 18, 2022, our executive officers, directors, and affiliated stockholders beneficially owned approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, non-affiliated five percent or greater stockholders beneficially owned approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders will have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions. For example, if these stockholders were to act together, they could exert significant influence over matters such as elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a hostile takeover or change in control of us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be authorized for issuance by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u2022expressly authorize our board of directors to modify, alter, or repeal our amended and restated by-laws; and\n\u2022require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nTable of Content\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe do not currently intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business or to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur amended and restated by-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated by-laws, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees, or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated by-laws, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the Delaware Forum Provision). The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Our amended and restated by-laws further provide that the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the Federal Forum Provision). Our amended and restated by-laws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision.\nThe Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as applicable. Additionally, the forum selection clauses in our amended and restated by-laws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is unenforceable or invalid, and if the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs in resolving such matters. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.\nGeneral risk factors\nOur employees, principal investigators, and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators leading our clinical trials, and consultants. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in the EU and other jurisdictions; provide accurate information to the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory authorities; comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take may be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nUnfavorable U.S. or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTable of Content\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets, including by the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic. The most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the most recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our investigational medicines and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on favorable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nEmployee litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business.\nOur employees may, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, creating a hostile workplace, discrimination, wage and hour disputes, sexual harassment, or other employment issues. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally. Coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience, these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses. Certain companies that have faced employment- or harassment-related lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel, and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their business. Any employment-related claim could negatively affect our business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and flammable materials and wastes, including chemicals and biological materials. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these hazardous materials and waste products, and we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impair our research, development, or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. income taxation are constantly under review by legislative and tax authorities. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us and our stockholders. In recent years, such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nTable of Content\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our research, development candidates, investigational medicines, and the diseases our development candidates and investigational medicines are being developed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This uncertainty creates risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us. For example, subjects may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, we may fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public\u2019s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our development candidates and investigational medicines. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions, or incur other harm to our business.", "PERMNO": 18312, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MRNA"}
