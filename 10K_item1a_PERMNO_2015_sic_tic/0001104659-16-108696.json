RISK FACTORS\nThere are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have changed the focus of our business to acquiring patents and patent rights and monetizing the value of those assets through enforcement campaigns that are expected to generate revenue. We may not be able to successfully monetize the patents that we acquire and thus we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully acquire, develop or monetize our patent portfolio. The acquisition of patents could fail to produce anticipated benefits or there could be other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Failure to successfully monetize our patents would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the acquisition of patent portfolios is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 There is a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from such patent asset. During such time lag, substantial amounts of costs are likely to be incurred that could have a negative effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position;\n\u00b7 The monetization of a patent portfolio is a time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our operations. If our monetization efforts are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits from such acquisition; and\n\u00b7 We may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through public or private debt or equity financings, borrowings or otherwise. If we are required to raise additional working capital in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain additional working capital, as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTherefore, there is no assurance that the monetization of our patent portfolios will generate enough revenue to recoup our investment.\nWe presently rely upon the patent assets we acquire from other patent owners. If we are unable to monetize such assets and generate revenue and profit through those assets or by other means, there is a significant risk that our business would fail.\nWhen we commenced our current line of business in 2012, we acquired a portfolio of patent assets from Sampo IP, LLC (\u201cSampo\u201d), a company affiliated with our Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Croxall, from which we have generated revenue from enforcement activities and for which we plan to continue to generate enforcement related revenue. On April 16, 2013, we acquired a patent from Mosaid Technologies Incorporated, a Canadian corporation. On April 22, 2013, we acquired a patent portfolio through a merger between our wholly-owned subsidiary, CyberFone Acquisition Corp., a Texas corporation and CyberFone Systems LLC, a Texas limited liability company (\u201cCyberFone Systems\u201d). In June 2013, in connection with the closing of a licensing agreement with Siemens Technology, we acquired a patent portfolio from that company. In September 2013, we acquired a portfolio from TeleCommunication Systems and an additional portfolio from Intergraph Corporation. In October 2013, we acquired a patent portfolio from TT IP, LLC. In December 2013 we engaged in three transactions: (i) in connection with a licensing agreement with Zhone, we acquired a portfolio of patents from that company; (ii) we acquired a patent portfolio from Delphi Technologies, Inc.; and (iii) in connection with a settlement and license agreement, we agreed to settle and release a defendant for past and future use of our patents, whereby the defendant agreed to assign and transfer two U.S. patents and rights to us. In May 2014, we acquired ownership rights of Dynamic Advances, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, IP Liquidity Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and Sarif Biomedical, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, all of which hold patent portfolios or contract rights to the revenue generated from patent portfolios. In June 2014, we acquired Selene Communication Technologies, LLC, which holds multiple patents in the search and network intrusion field. In August 2014, we acquired patents from Clouding IP LLC, with such patents related to network and data management technology. In September 2014, we acquired TLI Communications, which owns a single patent in the telecommunication field. In October 2014, we acquired three patent portfolios from MedTech Development, LLC, which owns medical technology patents. We plan to generate revenues from our acquired patent portfolios. However, if our efforts to generate revenue from these assets fail, we will have incurred significant losses and may be unable to acquire additional assets. If this occurs, our business would likely fail.\nWe have economic interests in patent portfolios that the Company does not control and the decision regarding the timing and amount of licenses are held by third parties, which could lead to outcomes materially different than what the Company intended.\nThe Company owns contract rights to two patent portfolios over which it does not exercise control and cannot determine when and if, and if so, for how much, the patent owner licenses the patents. This could lead to situations where we have dedicated resources, time and money to portfolios that, despite the best interests of the Company, provide little or no return on our investment. In these situations, the Company would record a loss on its investment and incur losses that contribute to the overall performance of the Company and could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition.\nFailure to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a strain on our limited managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Further, as our subsidiary companies\u2019 businesses grow, we will be required to continue to manage multiple relationships. Any further growth by us or our subsidiary companies, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships, may place additional strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results would be materially harmed.\nWe initiate legal proceedings against potentially infringing companies in the normal course of our business and we believe that extended litigation proceedings would be time-consuming and costly, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business.\nTo monetize our patent assets, we generally initiate legal proceedings against potential infringing companies, pursuant to which we may allege that such companies infringe on one or more of our patents. Our viability could be highly dependent on the outcome of the litigation, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation, which failure would substantially harm our business. In addition, the defendants in the litigations are likely to be much larger than us and have substantially more resources than we do, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult and impact the duration of the litigation which would require us to devote our limited financial, managerial and other resources to support litigation that may be disproportionate to the anticipated recovery.\nWe anticipate that these legal proceedings may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against others to enforce or defend our patent rights or to determine the validity and scope of other party\u2019s patent rights. The defendants or other third parties involved in the lawsuits in which we are involved may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims or commence re-examination proceedings by patenting issuance authorities in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement, or declare our patents to be invalid or non-infringed. If such defenses or counterclaims are successful, they may preclude our ability to derive monetization revenue from the patents we own. A negative outcome of any such litigation, or an outcome which affects one or more claims contained within any such litigation, could materially and adversely impact our business. Additionally, we anticipate that our legal fees and other expenses will be material and will negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to continue our business.\nVariability in intellectual property laws may adversely affect our intellectual property position.\nIntellectual property laws, and patent laws and regulations in particular, have been subject to significant variability either through administrative or legislative changes to such laws or regulations or changes or differences in judicial interpretation, and it is expected that such variability will continue to occur. Additionally, intellectual property laws and regulations differ among countries. Variations in the patent laws and regulations or in interpretations of patent laws and regulations in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may change the impact of third-party intellectual property on us. Accordingly, we cannot predict the scope of patents that may be granted to us, the extent to which we will be able to enforce our patents against third parties, or the extent to which third parties may be able to enforce their patents against us.\nWe may seek to internally develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities.\nWe may in the future seek to engage in commercial business ventures or seek internal development of new inventions or intellectual property. These activities would require significant amounts of financial, managerial and other resources and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from its present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that such initiatives may not yield any viable new business or revenue, inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of our investment in such activities.\nIn addition, even if we are able to internally develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain, and we would be heavily reliant upon, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally including the following:\n\u00b7 patent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;\n\u00b7 any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7 other companies may challenge patents issued to us;\n\u00b7 other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n\u00b7 other companies may design around technologies we have developed; and\n\u00b7 enforcement of our patents would be complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future patent applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may acquire, our continued rights will depend on meeting any obligations to the seller and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nMoreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nOur future success depends on our ability to expand our organization to match the growth of our activities.\nAs our operations grow, the administrative demands upon us will grow, and our success will depend upon our ability to meet those demands. We are organized as a holding company, with numerous subsidiaries. Both the parent company and each of our subsidiaries require certain financial, managerial and other resources, which could create challenges to our ability to successfully manage our subsidiaries and operations and impact our ability to assure compliance with our policies, practices and procedures. These demands include, but are not limited to, increased executive, accounting, management, legal services, staff support and general office services. We may need to hire additional qualified personnel to meet these demands, the cost and quality of which is dependent in part upon market factors outside of our control. Further, we will need to effectively manage the training and growth of our staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPotential acquisitions may present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial or other goals intended at the time of any potential acquisition.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to acquire patented technologies, patent portfolios or companies holding such patented technologies and patent portfolios. Accordingly, we have engaged in acquisitions to expand our patent portfolios and we intend to continue to explore such acquisitions. Such acquisitions are subject to numerous risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 our inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential acquisition, or if we are able to enter into such agreement, our inability to consummate the potential acquisition;\n\u00b7 difficulty integrating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired entity including achieving anticipated synergies;\n\u00b7 our inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of the specific acquisition;\n\u00b7 difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and monetization process;\n\u00b7 diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u00b7 failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios and other legal and financial contingencies.\nIf we are unable to manage these risks effectively as part of any acquisition, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur revenues are unpredictable, and this may harm our financial condition.\nFrom November 12, 2012 to the present, our operating subsidiaries have executed our business strategy of acquiring patent portfolios and accompanying patent rights and monetizing the value of those assets. As of December 31, 2015, on a consolidated basis, our operating subsidiaries owned, controlled or had economic rights to 327 patent assets, which include U.S. patents and certain foreign counterparts, covering technologies used in a wide variety of industries. These acquisitions continue to expand and diversify our revenue generating opportunities. However, due to the nature of our patent monetization business and uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of the receipt of funds from the monetization of our patent assets resulting in part from uncertainties regarding the outcome of enforcement actions, rates of adoption of our patented technologies, outlook for the businesses for defendants, and certain other factors, our revenues may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our quarterly results to fall below expectations and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur patent monetization cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing, legal and administrative efforts may be unsuccessful.\nWe expect significant marketing, legal and administrative expenses prior to generating revenue from monetization efforts. We will also spend considerable time and resources educating defendants on the benefits of a settlement, prior to or during litigation, that may include issuing a license to our patents and patent rights. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before revenue streams commence.\nIf our efforts to convince defendants of the benefits of a settlement arrangement prior to litigation are unsuccessful, we may need to continue with the litigation process or other enforcement action to protect our patent rights and to realize revenue from those rights. We may also need to litigate to enforce the terms of existing license agreements, protect our trade secretsor determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Enforcement actions will divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations.\nOur exposure to uncontrollable risks, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), could adversely affect our activities including our revenues, expenses and results of operations.\nOur patent acquisition and monetization business is subject to numerous risks including new legislation, regulations and rules.\nIf new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the executive branch, or the courts, that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process, the rights of patent holders, or litigation practices, such changes could materially and negatively affect our revenue and expenses and, therefore, our results of operations and the overall success of our Company. On March 16, 2013 the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act or the America Invents Act became effective. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation\nattempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual allegedly-infringing parties by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the America Invents Act enacted a new inter-partes review, or IPR, process at the USPTO which can be used by defendants, and other individuals and entities, to separately challenge the validity of any patent. At this time, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will have on the operation of our patent monetization and enforcement business. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Patents from nine of our portfolios are currently the subject of inter-partes reviews.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively monetize and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies. Also, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has published its intent to initiate a proposed study under Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to evaluate the patent assertion practice and market impact of Patent Assertion Entities, or PAEs. The FTC\u2019s notice and request for public comment relating to the PAE study appeared in the Federal Register on October 3, 2013. The FTC has solicited information from the Company regarding its portfolios and activities, and the Company is currently in the process of complying with the FTC request for such information. It is expected that the results of the PAE study by the FTC will be provided to Congress and other agencies, such as the DOJ, who could take action, including legislative proposals, based on the results of the study.\nFinally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could substantially increase the cost of our enforcement actions and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.\nChanges in patent laws could adversely impact our business.\nPatent laws may continue to change and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult for us to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents against infringing parties. Increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes that increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. For instance, in December 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that would require non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay defendants\u2019 legal fees if the lawsuits are unsuccessful and certain standards are not met.\nTrial judges and juries often find it difficult to understand complex patent enforcement litigation, and as a result, we may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce our patent rights.\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of litigation, particularly patent enforcement litigation. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies and, as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed final non-appealable judgments that can require payment of damages to the Company. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions that may be made by juries and trial courts.\nMore patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO.\nWe hold and continue to acquire pending patents in the application or review phase. We believe there is a trend of increasing patent applications each year, which we believe is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in monetizing such patents which could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nThe length of time required time to litigate an enforcement action is increasing.\nOur patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal and other cases. Criminal cases always take priority over our actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil and criminal proceedings and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions has grown and will continue to grow and will increasingly affect our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nAny reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.\nOur ownership or acquisition of pending patent applications before the USPTO is subject to funding and other risks applicable to a government agency. The value of our patent portfolio is dependent, in part, on the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of our assets. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.\nOur acquisitions of patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets, are often time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. We may utilize many different transaction structures in our acquisitions and the terms of such acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we expect to incur significant operating expenses and may be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition is ultimately not consummated. Even if we are able to acquire particular patent assets, there is no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenue related to those patent assets to offset the acquisition costs. While we will seek to conduct sufficient due diligence on the patent assets we are considering for acquisition, we may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets. In those cases, we may be required to spend significant resources to defend our ownership interest in the patent assets and, if we are not successful, our acquisition may be invalid, in which case we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.\nWe may also identify patent or other patent assets that cost more than we are prepared to spend. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent assets or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. These higher costs could adversely affect our operating results and, if we incur losses, the value of our securities will decline.\nIn addition, we may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies will likely be untested and may be subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our companies may adopt our patented technologies in their products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire or develop will have value that we can monetize.\nIn certain acquisitions of patent assets, we may seek to defer payment or finance a portion of the acquisition price. This approach may put us at a competitive disadvantage and could result in harm to our business.\nWe have limited capital and may seek to negotiate acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets where we can defer payments or finance a portion of the acquisition price. These types of debt financing or deferred payment arrangements may not be as attractive to sellers of patent assets as receiving the full purchase price for those assets in cash at the closing of the acquisition. As a result, we might not compete effectively against other companies in the market for acquiring patent assets, many of whom have substantially greater cash resources than we have. In addition, any failure to satisfy any debt repayment obligations that we may incur, may result in adverse consequences to our operating results.\nAny failure to maintain or protect our patent assets could significantly impair our return on investment from such assets and harm our brand, our business and our operating results.\nOur ability to operate our business and compete in the patent market largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our acquired patent assets. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on and will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, common interest agreements and agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures we undertake to protect and maintain the value of our assets will be successful.\nFollowing the acquisition of patent assets, we will likely be required to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of such assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the USPTO. We may acquire patent assets, including patent applications that require us to spend resources to prosecute such patent applications with the USPTO. Moreover, there is a material risk that patent related claims (such as, for example, infringement claims (and/or claims for indemnification resulting therefrom), unenforceability claims or invalidity claims) will be asserted or prosecuted against us, and such assertions or prosecutions could materially and adversely affect our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our core business activities.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of our intellectual property:\n\u00b7 our patent applications, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u00b7 issued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages when compared to potentially infringing other properties;\n\u00b7 our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or\n\u00b7 our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we acquire and/or prosecute.\nMoreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed.\nWeak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into settlement and licensing agreements, which could prolong our litigation and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions, and the United States and world economies have recently experienced weak economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material adverse effect on the willingness of parties infringing on our assets to enter into settlements or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily. Entering into such agreements is critical to our business and our failure to do so could cause material harm to our business.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our patent assets, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur ability to compete depends in part upon the strength of the patents and patent rights that we own or may hereafter acquire. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents, copyrights, trademark, trade secret laws and other types of agreements to establish and protect our patent, intellectual property and proprietary rights. The efforts we take to protect our patents, intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of our patents, intellectual property and proprietary rights. In addition, effective trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our services are made available. There may be instances where we are not able to fully protect or utilize our patent and other intellectual property in a manner that maximizes competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect our patent assets and intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of those assets may be reduced, which could negatively impact our business. Our inability to obtain appropriate protections for our intellectual property may also allow competitors to enter markets and produce or sell the same or similar products. In addition, protecting our patents and patent rights is expensive and diverts critical managerial resources. If any of the foregoing were to occur, or if we are otherwise unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are forced to resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive. In addition, our patent rights could be at risk if we are unsuccessful in, or cannot afford to pursue, those proceedings. We also rely on trade secrets and contract law to protect some of our patent rights and proprietary technology. We will enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees and consultants. Nevertheless, these agreements may not be honored and they may not effectively protect our right to our un-patented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe expect that we will be substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers. If we are unable to establish, maintain or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base, our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited.\nA significant portion of our revenues will be generated from a limited number of customers and licenses to such customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the five largest licenses accounted for approximately 62% of our revenue. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional licenses for the Company\u2019s patents, or if we able to do so, that the licenses will be of the same or larger size allowing us to sustain or grow our revenue levels, respectively. If we are not able to generate licenses from the limited group of prospective customers that we anticipate may generate a substantial majority of our revenues in the future, or if they do not generate revenues at the levels or at the times that we anticipate, our ability to maintain or grow our revenues and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe acquired the rights to market and license a patent analytics tool from IP Navigation Group, LLC and will dedicate resources and incur costs in an effort to generate revenues. We may not be able to generate revenues and there is a risk that the time spent marketing and licensing the tool will distract management from the enforcement of the Company\u2019s patent portfolios.\nWe expect to dedicate resources and incur costs in the marketing and licensing of Opus Analytic, the patent analytics tool, in order to generate revenue, but there are no assurances that our efforts will be successful. We may not generate any revenues from the licensing of Opus Analytic or may not generate enough license revenue to exceed our costs. Our efforts therefore could lead to losses and could have a material adverse affect on our income, expenses or results of operations.\nIn addition, the time and effort spent marketing and licensing Opus Analytics could distract the Company and its officers from the management of the balance of the Company\u2019s business and have a deleterious effect on results from the enforcement of the Company\u2019s patents and patent rights. This could lead to either sub-par returns from the patent and patent right enforcement efforts or even total losses of the value of such patents and patent rights, leading to considerable losses.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness and future indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have $23,607,061 of indebtedness outstanding, net of discounts. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u00b7 make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7 expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our existing credit facility is variable;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt and greater financial resources.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u00b7 economic and demand factors affecting our industry;\n\u00b7 pricing pressures;\n\u00b7 increased operating costs;\n\u00b7 competitive conditions; and\n\u00b7 other operating difficulties.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount. Our obligations pursuant to our loan agreement with Fortress (as defined below) are secured by a security interest in all of our assets, exclusive of intellectual property. The foregoing encumbrances may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations. We also may not be able to restructure our indebtedness on favorable economic terms, if at all.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including pursuant to the Fortress Documents (as defined herein). Our incurrence of additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nThe Fortress Documents contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\nOn January 29, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements including a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cFortress Purchase Agreement\u201d) and a Subscription Agreement with DBD Credit Funding, LLC (\u201cDBD\u201d), an affiliate of Fortress Credit Corp., pursuant to which the Company sold to the purchasers: (i) $15,000,000 original principal amount of Senior Secured Notes (the \u201cFortress Notes\u201d), (ii) a right to receive a portion of certain proceeds from monetization net revenues received by the Company (after receipt by the Company of $15,000,000 of monetization net revenues and repayment of the Fortress Notes), (iii) a five-year warrant (the \u201cFortress Warrant\u201d) to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock exercisable at $7.44 per share, subject to adjustment; and (iv) 134,409 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Pursuant to the Fortress Purchase Agreement, as security for the payment and performance in full of the secured obligations, the Company and certain subsidiaries executed and delivered in favor of the purchasers a Security Agreement and a Patent Security Agreement, including a pledge of the Company\u2019s interests in certain of its subsidiaries (together with the Fortress Purchase Agreement, the Fortress Notes and the Fortress Warrant, the \u201cFortress Documents\u201d). On February 12, 2015, the Company exercised its right to require the purchasers to purchase an additional $5,000,000 of Notes from the Company.\nThe Fortress Documents contain, subject to certain carve-outs, various restrictive covenants that limit our management\u2019s discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt;\n\u00b7 grant liens on assets;\n\u00b7 dispose assets outside the ordinary course of business; and\n\u00b7 make fundamental business changes.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the Fortress Documents, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debt and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which will typically include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds.\nThe rights of the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock will be subordinate to our creditors.\nOn October 13, 2014, we issued a note in the amount of $9,000,000 pursuant to the acquisition of three patent portfolios from MedTech Development, LLC, of which $2,952,435 remains outstanding as of December 31, 2015. On October 16, 2014, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,550,000, which mature on October 16, 2018, of which, $500,000 remains outstanding as of December 31, 2015. On January 29, 2015 and February 12, 2015, we issued to DBD notes in the principal amounts of $15,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively. Including payable in kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest, $20,513,892 remains outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nAccordingly, the holders of Common Stock will rank junior to such indebtedness, as well as to other non-equity claims on the Company and our assets, including claims upon liquidation.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock\nOur management will be able to exert significant influence over us to the detriment of minority stockholders.\nOur executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 15.4% of our outstanding Common Stock as of March 15, 2016. As a result, our management could exert significant influence over our business and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers or other fundamental corporate transactions. The concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and could affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nExercise of warrants will dilute stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership.\nWe have issued options and warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock to our officers, directors, consultants and certain shareholders. In the future, we may grant additional options, warrants and convertible securities. The exercise or conversion of options, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders. The dilutive effect of the exercise or conversion of these securities may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital. The holders of these securities may be expected to exercise or convert such options, warrants and convertible securities at a time when we would be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable than such securities or when our common stock is trading at a price higher than the exercise or conversion price of the securities. The exercise or conversion of outstanding warrants, options and convertible securities will have a dilutive effect on the securities held by our stockholders.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur Common Stock is currently traded on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cMARA\u201d. If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our Common Stock could be delisted from NASDAQ. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as:\n\u00b7 a $1.00 minimum closing bid price;\n\u00b7 stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million;\n\u00b7 500,000 shares of publicly-held Common Stock with a market value of at least $1 million;\n\u00b7 300 round-lot stockholders; and\n\u00b7 compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of NASDAQ\u2019s discretionary authority.\nWe could fail in future financing efforts or be delisted from NASDAQ if we fail to receive stockholder approval when required.\nUnder the NASDAQ rules, we are required to obtain stockholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise 20% or more of the total shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to the greater of book or market value in an offering that is not deemed to be a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by NASDAQ. Funding of our operations and acquisitions of assets may require issuance of additional equity securities at a discount that would comprise 20% or more of the total shares of our Common Stock outstanding, but we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for such an issuance. If we are unable to obtain financing due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nOur Common Stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our Common Stock.\nThere has been limited trading in our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our Common Stock will either develop or be maintained. Our Common Stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our will be stable or appreciate over time.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock will experience immediate and substantial dilution upon the conversion of the Company\u2019s outstanding preferred stock, convertible note and the exercise of the Company\u2019s outstanding warrants.\nOn May 1, 2014, we issued 2,047,158 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), 782,000 shares of our par value $0.0001 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 511,790 shares of Common Stock. In addition, pursuant to a consulting agreement entered into in September 2014, we entered into an agreement to issue 200,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to which we issued 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock on September 17, 2014 and 16,666 shares of Series B Preferred Stock on the monthly anniversary of entering into the agreement for the next six months. We issued convertible notes and warrants to purchase 258,998 shares of Common Stock on October 16, 2014. Finally, we issued a five-year warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock exercisable at $7.44 per share, and 134,409 shares of Common Stock to DBD Credit Funding, LLC (\u201cDBD\u201d) on January 29, 2015. While all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was automatically converted into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation during the year ended December 31, 2014, notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,050,000 were redeemed in February, 2015 and 199,996 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, upon conversion of the remaining Series B Preferred Stock and convertible notes and exercise of the warrants, you will experience dilution. Assuming full conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and the convertible notes and exercise of the outstanding options and warrants, the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding will increase 6,253,246 shares from 14,967,141 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of March 15, 2016 to 21,220,387 shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 changes in our industry;\n\u00b7 competitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our Common Stock;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7 loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments; and\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe have never paid nor do we expect in the near future to pay cash dividends.\nOn November 19, 2014, we declared a stock dividend pursuant to which holders of our common stock as of the close of business on December 15, 2014 received one additional share of Common Stock for each share of common stock held by such holders. Other than as described herein, we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future. While it is possible that we may declare a dividend after a large settlement, investors should not rely on such a possibility, nor should they rely on an investment in us if they require income generated from dividends paid on our capital stock. Any income derived from our Common Stock would only come from rise in the market price of our Common Stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, under Rule 144, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or other convertible securities, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and in anticipation of which the market price of our Common Stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. The shares of our restricted Common Stock will be freely tradable upon the earlier of: (i) effectiveness of a registration statement covering such shares and (ii) the date on which such shares may be sold without registration pursuant to Rule 144 (or other applicable exemption) under the Securities Act.\nBecause we became a public company by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.\nThere may be risks associated with us becoming a public company through a reverse merger. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our Common Stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will, in the future, want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf.\nInvestor relations activities, nominal \u201cfloat\u201d and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock.\nWe expect to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to generate investor awareness. These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described. We may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third parties based upon publicly-available information concerning us. We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts\u2019 reports or other materials based upon analysts\u2019 own research or methods. Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. In addition, investors may, from time to time, also take steps to encourage investor awareness through similar activities that may be undertaken at the expense of the investors. Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market our Common Stock.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management, including Doug Croxall, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Croxall or any other key members of management would have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have entered into an amendment to the employment agreement with Mr. Croxall, which extends the term of his employment agreement to November 2017. In addition, Erich Spangenberg, the founder and former Chief Executive Officer and principal of IP Nav and a significant stockholder of the Company, is also important to the success of our Company. We do not have any agreement with Mr. Spangenberg related to services he is to perform for IP Nav or the Company. We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining our employees in the future. We are competing for employees against companies that are more established than we are and that have the ability to pay more cash compensation than we do. As of the date hereof, we have not experienced problems hiring employees.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any future internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical un-discovered failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement.\nAs a result of its internal control assessment, the Company determined there is a material weakness with respect to segregation of duties.\nThe Company determined that there is a material weakness in its internal controls with respect to the segregation of duties. Since the Company has six employees, most of whom have no involvement in our financial controls and reporting, we are unable to sufficiently distribute reporting and accounting to tasks across enough individuals to insure that the Company does not have a material weakness in its financial reporting system.", "PERMNO": 14813, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "MARA"}
