{"cik": "764478", "company": "BEST BUY CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nDescribed below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\nWe face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.\nWhile we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us.\nThe retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.\nOur strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.\nAs we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues. For example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, we may be subject to privacy and information security rules, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and/or subject to increased potential liability risk.\nThis expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise.\nIn fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology. The new health-related services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services. In addition, the services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.\nWe offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:\n\u2022 increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;\n\u2022 pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;\n\u2022 increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;\n\u2022 unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;\n\u2022 employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;\n\u2022 the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;\n\u2022 employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and privacy of the data they hold;\n\u2022 the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;\n\u2022 the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and\n\u2022 increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services.\nWe are subject to risks associated with company transformation.\nOur transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income growth, including our Building the New Blue strategy, and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material impact on achieving that strategy.\nAny limitations in organizational, financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages, creating solutions for customers and providing differentiated value. If we do not have access to, or fail to dedicate, the appropriate people, management focus and resources to implementing these transformational objectives, our long-term growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2020, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG - representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms.\nWe are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.\nIf we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.\nWe operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Market increases to employee hourly wage rates, increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits, and our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material impact to the profitability of our business.\nWe are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;\n\u2022 the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;\n\u2022 the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;\n\u2022 the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\");\n\u2022 the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;\n\u2022 the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and\n\u2022 the impact of the general election on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies.\nWith respect to the CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, the statute provides new privacy rights for California residents and requires companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, allowing them to opt out of certain uses of their personal information. In addition, the California Attorney General has issued proposed rules under the CCPA. We cannot predict the impact of this first-of-its-kind statute and these rules that have not yet been finalized, in addition to potential privacy and security legislation in other states and the U.S. federal level, on our business or operations, but these legislative initiatives may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, interfere with intended business operations or lead us to incur incremental expenses in an effort to comply.\nThe impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects, as we did in fiscal 2020.\nFurther, the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.\nMacroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effects of novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID 19\u201d) may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.\nTo varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:\n\u2022 whether or not they make a purchase;\n\u2022 their choice of brand, model or price-point;\n\u2022 how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and\n\u2022 their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).\nReal GDP growth, consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic discussed in the following risk factor, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe impact of COVID-19 is expected to adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nConcerns have rapidly grown regarding the outbreak of COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine have increased, which will adversely affect traffic to our stores. In particular, we recently announced a shift to enhanced curbside service only for all of our stores on an interim basis. Further, all in-home installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all in-home consultations are being conducted virtually. The significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores caused by COVID-19 will likely result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. We may further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities if we deem this necessary or if recommended or mandated by authorities and these measures could have a further material impact on our sales and profits. Also, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future.\nCOVID-19 also impacted our supply chain for products we sell, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured. We could also see significant disruptions to our supply chain in the U.S. as well as significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending.\nIn addition, we expect to incur significant costs in our response to the pandemic, including, but not limited to, costs incurred to\nimplement the operational changes described above and certain payments to or other costs relating to employees who are not working during the pandemic.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain.\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nAs discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our differential service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.\nOur information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.\nOur information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from COVID-19, including for example, a significant increase in remote working of our employees and an increase in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations.\nWe also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation.\nFailure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.\nOur business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which transmit information for a variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims.\nSensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships.\nIncreasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud, and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, such as the CCPA, are expanding our obligations to protect the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.\nFailure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, \"new ventures\"). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:\n\u2022 different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;\n\u2022 failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;\n\u2022 uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;\n\u2022 failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;\n\u2022 failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022 failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;\n\u2022 unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;\n\u2022 disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and\n\u2022 adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.\nIf new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business.\nWe are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\nA large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.\nMany of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.\nWe operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles.\nThis rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.\nEconomic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs.\nWe offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2020 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs.\nInterruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business.\nOur supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 interruptions to our delivery capabilities;\n\u2022 failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;\n\u2022 disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;\n\u2022 limitations in capacity;\n\u2022 consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;\n\u2022 labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;\n\u2022 diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns, which have resulted in and could continue to result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022 damages or other loss to products; and\n\u2022 increasing transportation costs.\nIt is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.\nCatastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example:\n\u2022 natural disasters or extreme weather events;\n\u2022 diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;\n\u2022 floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; or\n\u2022 terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts.\nIn recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. They can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nDemand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focused consumer experience approach.\nWe operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nProduct safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.\nIf the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.\nChanges to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.\nAs an employer of nearly 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example:\n\u2022 the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board continually considers;\n\u2022 laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and\n\u2022 laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.\nChanges to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.\nFailure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.\nEffective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased, of which some are subject to long-term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:\n\u2022 changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;\n\u2022 the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;\n\u2022 the interior layout, format and size of our stores;\n\u2022 the products and services we offer at each store;\n\u2022 the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;\n\u2022 the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store;\n\u2022 the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; and\n\u2022 our supply chain service location network strategy.\nIf we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:\n\u2022 closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;\n\u2022 incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;\n\u2022 operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and\n\u2022 bearing excessive lease expenses.\nThese consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nFor leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.\nConstraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nWe need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing, our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.\nChanges in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.\nAny future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.\nWe utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their services might have an impact to our business.\nWe engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.\nOur exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.\nSales of our exclusive brands products, which include Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as other products such as Jitterbug, Lively Mobile and Lively Mobile Plus, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:\n\u2022 we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022 we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;\n\u2022 we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to COVID-19, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters;\n\u2022 we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;\n\u2022 we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return to vendor rights;\n\u2022 we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;\n\u2022 we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;\n\u2022 our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply;\n\u2022 we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and\n\u2022 regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nMaintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them.\nWe are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S.\nOur ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.\nWe operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Barbados, Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the U.K. During fiscal 2020, our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:\n\u2022 political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;\n\u2022 economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;\n\u2022 rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;\n\u2022 government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;\n\u2022 cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;\n\u2022 different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.\nThese factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.\nFailure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.", "PERMNO": 85914, "SIC": 5731, "TIC": "BBY"}
