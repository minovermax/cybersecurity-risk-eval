RISK FACTORS\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur revenues, profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. For example, due to the significant decrease in crude oil prices over the past year, we have significantly reduced our planned drilling and completion capital expenditures for 2016 and we currently expect to spend approximately $140 million to $160 million. The amount we will be able to borrow under our Senior Credit Agreement will be subject to periodic redetermination based in part on current oil and natural gas prices and on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce and have an adverse effect on the value of our properties. Sustained low prices may extend beyond the period of our current hedging transactions, which could prevent us from entering into new hedges at terms (or prices) acceptable to us, and could adversely affect our cash flows after our current hedges expire.\nHistorically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Among the factors that can cause volatility are:\n\u2022 the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels;\n\u2022 social unrest and political instability, particularly in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States, such as the Middle East, and armed conflict or terrorist attacks, whether or not in oil or natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022 the level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022 the growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets, such as China;\n\u2022 labor unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022 weather conditions, including hurricanes and other natural occurrences that affect the supply and/or demand of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022 the price of foreign imports;\n\u2022 worldwide economic conditions; and\n\u2022 the availability of liquid natural gas imports.\nThese external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas.\nWe are currently out of compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's minimum share price requirement and are at risk of the NYSE delisting our common stock, which could materially impair the liquidity and value of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. On August 25, 2015, we were notified by the NYSE that the average closing price of our common stock had fallen below $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, which is the minimum average share price required by the NYSE. The NYSE will permit us to regain compliance by: (i) obtaining the requisite stockholder approval for a plan to regain compliance (such as a reverse stock split) by no later than our annual stockholder meeting in 2016, (ii) implementing the action promptly thereafter and (iii) the price of our common stock promptly exceeding $1.00 per share, and the price remaining above that level for at least the following 30 trading days. If we are unable to regain compliance, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. In addition, if our common stock price remains below the $1.00 per share threshold and falls to the point where the NYSE considers the stock price to be \"abnormally low,\" the NYSE has the discretion to begin delisting procedures immediately. While there is no formal definition of \"abnormally low\" in the NYSE rules, the NYSE has recently delisted the common stock of issuers trading below $0.16 per share.\nA delisting of our common stock, either as result of a failure to regain compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price requirement or our failure to satisfy other qualitative or quantitative standards for continued listing on the NYSE, could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. Moreover, a delisting of our common stock could constitute a \"fundamental change\" under the terms of our convertible preferred stock, which might require us to reserve a significantly greater number of shares of our common stock for issuance upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock and deplete the number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance for other purposes.\nWe may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures which could adversely affect our growth.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs, primarily as a result of our drilling program. We may continue to selectively increase our acreage position, which would require capital in addition to the capital necessary to drill on our existing acreage. In addition, it is possible that we will acquire acreage in other areas that we believe are prospective for oil and natural gas production and expend capital to develop such acreage. We expect\nto use borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement and proceeds from potential future capital markets transactions, if necessary, to fund capital expenditures that are in excess of our cash flow and cash on hand.\nOur Senior Credit Agreement limits our borrowings to the lesser of the borrowing base and the total commitments. As of December 31, 2015, our Senior Credit Agreement was a $1.5 billion facility with a borrowing base of approximately $827.4 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $62.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, $1.6 million of letters of credit outstanding and $763.8 million of borrowing capacity available under our Senior Credit Agreement. Our borrowing base is determined semi-annually, and may also be redetermined periodically at the discretion of our lenders. Lower oil and natural gas prices may result in a reduction in our borrowing base at the next redetermination, which is currently scheduled for March 2016 and we expect the borrowing base to be confirmed between $650.0 million to $700.0 million. A reduction in our borrowing base could require us to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base. Our Senior Credit Agreement includes a covenant that requires the ratio of our total secured debt (excluding the Third Lien Notes) to EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) be no greater than 2.75 to 1.00. In the event we have difficulty meeting the total secured debt to EBITDA test or the current ratio test in the future, we would be required to seek additional relief, and there is no assurance that it would be granted. Additionally, the indentures governing our senior debt contain covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement, unless we meet one of two alternative tests. The first test applies to all indebtedness and requires that, after giving effect to the incurrence of additional debt, our fixed charge coverage ratio (which is the ratio of our adjusted consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our indentures) to our adjusted consolidated interest expense over the trailing four fiscal quarters) will be at least 2.0 to 1.0. The second test allows us to incur additional indebtedness, beyond the limitations of the fixed charge coverage ratio test, as long as this additional debt is incurred under Credit Facilities (as defined in our indentures) and, in the case of certain secured indebtedness, the amount thereof is not more than, subject to certain exceptions, the greater of (i) $950 million, (ii) the borrowing base in effect under our Senior Credit Agreement, and (iii) 30% of our adjusted consolidated net tangible assets, or ACNTA, and, in the case of unsecured indebtedness, the amount thereof is not more than the greater of the fixed sum of $750 million or 30% of our ACNTA. ACNTA is defined in all of our indentures and is determined primarily by the value of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the capitalized cost attributable to our unevaluated properties. Currently, we are permitted to incur additional indebtedness under these incurrence tests, but may be limited in the future. Lower oil and natural gas prices in the future could reduce our adjusted consolidated EBITDA, as well as our adjusted consolidated net tangible assets, and thus could reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nAdditionally, our ability to complete future equity offerings is limited by general market conditions. If we are not able to borrow sufficient amounts under our Senior Credit Agreement and/or are unable to raise sufficient capital to fund our capital expenditures, we may be required to curtail our drilling, development, land acquisition and other activities, which could result in a decrease in our production of oil and natural gas, forfeiture of leasehold interests if we are unable or unwilling to renew them, and could force us to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results and future operations.\nWe may be required to take non-cash asset write downs.\nWe may be required under full cost accounting rules to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties if oil and natural gas prices do not improve or if there are substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting, we are required by SEC\nregulations to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or \"ceiling,\" of the book value of oil and natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value (discounted at 10%) of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges when hedge accounting is applied, calculated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of each month for the 12-month period ending at the balance sheet date. If the net book value of oil and natural gas properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligation) exceeds the ceiling limitation, SEC regulations require us to impair or \"write down\" the book value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nDue to the decline in the unweighted 12-month average price of oil and natural gas during 2015, the net book value of our oil and natural gas properties at March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2015 exceeded the respective ceiling amounts for each quarter end. As a result we recorded full cost ceiling test impairments before income taxes of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. As ceiling test computations depend upon the calculated unweighted arithmetic average prices and oil and natural gas prices are inherently volatile, sustained lower commodity prices will continue to have a material impact upon our full cost ceiling test calculation. Continued write downs of oil and natural gas properties may occur until such time as commodity prices have recovered, and remained at recovered levels, so as to increase the 12-month average price used in the ceiling calculation. Depending on the magnitude, a ceiling test write down could materially affect our results of operations.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties, which were approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2015, are not initially subject to the ceiling test limitation. Rather, we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value based upon our intentions with respect to drilling on such properties, the remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results, the assignment of proved reserves, and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. These factors are significantly influenced by our expectations regarding future commodity prices, development costs, and access to capital at acceptable cost. During any period in which these factors indicate impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and the ceiling test limitation. Accordingly, a significant change in these factors, many of which are beyond our control, may shift a significant amount of cost from unevaluated properties into the full cost pool that is subject to depletion and the ceiling test limitation.\nWe are subject to various contractual limitations that affect the discretion of our management in operating our business.\nThe indentures governing our senior unsecured debt and our Senior Credit Agreement and the certificate of designations governing our Series A Preferred Stock contain various provisions that may limit our management's discretion in certain respects. In particular, these agreements limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase shares of our common stock and, under certain circumstances, our convertible preferred stock, and redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;\n\u2022 make loans to others;\n\u2022 make investments;\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock that is senior to our convertible preferred stock as to dividends or rights upon liquidation, winding-up or dissolution;\n\u2022 create certain liens;\n\u2022 sell assets;\n\u2022 enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole;\n\u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 enter into hedging contracts;\n\u2022 create unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022 enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nIn January 2016, we announced that future quarterly dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be suspended due to the weakened market conditions as a result of low commodity prices. Additionally, if dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears and unpaid for six or more quarterly periods, the holders (voting as a single class) of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors until paid in full.\nAs part of HK TMS's transaction with Apollo, there are certain restrictions on the transfer of assets, including cash, to us from HK TMS. HK TMS is required to maintain a minimum cash balance equal to two quarterly dividend payments, of approximately $3.0 million each, plus $10.0 million. Additionally, the quarterly 8% dividends paid to holders of the HK TMS preferred shares have priority over other cash distributions. No dividends shall be paid to us from HK TMS prior to December 31, 2016. HK TMS is restricted from transferring more than 20% of its maximum net acres and from transferring any assets exceeding 20% of HK TMS's proved reserves at any one time. Finally, proceeds from any such transfers of acres or other assets must be used for HK TMS's capital or operating expenditures, or to redeem the preferred shares.\nCompliance with these and other limitations may limit our ability to operate and finance our business and engage in certain transactions in the manner we might otherwise. In addition, if we fail to comply with the limitations under our indentures or Senior Credit Agreement, our creditors, if the agreements so provide, may accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make further funds available to us.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe have incurred substantial debt amounting to approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2015. As a result of our indebtedness, we will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay interest, which will reduce the amount we will have available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our indebtedness under our Senior Credit Agreement is at a variable interest rate, and so a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have hedging arrangements that are effective in mitigating interest rate fluctuations. The amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe may incur substantially more debt in the future. The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. Moreover, these\nrestrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute \"indebtedness\" as defined under the indentures. At December 31, 2015, our Senior Credit Agreement was a $1.5 billion facility with a borrowing base of approximately $827.4 million. At December 31, 2015, we had $62.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, $1.6 million of letters of credit outstanding and $763.8 million of borrowing capacity available under our Senior Credit Agreement.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional shares of common or preferred stock on terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at all. Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under that indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOffers or sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our shareholders may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have agreed to file registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the resale of approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, we have also agreed to file registration statements covering the approximately 31.1 million shares of common stock underlying the Convertible Note and the February 2012 Warrants. Should the stockholders to whom we owe these obligations exercise their rights to require us to file such registration statements, such filing, together with any actual sales of our common stock they may choose to make, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall and could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through future sales of equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, we could be limited in our ability to use net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change to offset future taxable income.\nIf we were to experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses (NOLs) arising prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nAssets we acquire may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities.\nOur growth in 2013 and 2014 was due significantly to acquisitions of exploration and production companies, producing properties and undeveloped and unevaluated leaseholds. Acquisitions may also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating and capital costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. We are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Normally, we acquire interests in properties on an \"as is\" basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to acquire oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nAs of the date of this filing, our corporate credit rating was \"SD\" by Standard and Poor's (S&P) and \"Caa2\" with a stable outlook by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's). Although we are not aware of any current plans of these or other rating agencies to lower their respective ratings on us or our senior debt, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. If our credit rating were downgraded, it could be difficult for us to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of that new debt could be higher than debt we could raise with our current ratings. In addition, a downgrade could impact requirements for us to provide financial assurance of performance under contractual arrangements or derivative agreements.\nWe may not be able to drill wells on a substantial portion of our acreage.\nWe may not be able to drill on a substantial portion of our acreage for various reasons. We may not generate or be able to raise sufficient capital to do so. Commodities pricing may also make drilling some acreage uneconomic. Our actual drilling activities and future drilling budget will depend on drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. In addition, any drilling activities we are able to conduct may not be successful or add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in shale formations, some of which are new and emerging, using horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling program using these techniques may be subject to more uncertainties than conventional drilling programs, especially in areas that are new and emerging. These uncertainties could result in an inability to meet our expectations for reserves and production.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations, such as the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation and the Utica / Point Pleasant formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to\npredict drilling results in these areas. In addition, the use of horizontal drilling and completion techniques used in all of our shale formations involve certain risks and complexities that do not exist in conventional wells. The ultimate success of our drilling and completion strategies and techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established.\nIf our drilling results are less than anticipated our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material write downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned leasehold interests in approximately 183,000 net acres in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation and 120,000 net acres in the Utica / Point Pleasant formations. A large portion of our acreage is not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing these leases during their terms or unless we pay (to the extent we have the contractual right to pay) delay rentals or obtain other extensions to maintain the lease, these leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties.\nOur drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. Further, some of our acreage is located in sections where we do not hold the majority of the acreage and therefore it is likely that we will not be named operator of these sections. As a non-operating leaseholder we have less control over the timing of drilling and are therefore subject to additional risk of expirations.\nOur ability to sell our production and/or receive market prices for our production may be adversely affected by transportation capacity constraints and interruptions.\nIf the amount of natural gas, condensate or oil being produced by us and others exceeds the capacity of the various transportation pipelines and gathering systems available in our operating areas, it will be necessary for new transportation pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Or, in the case of oil and condensate, it will be necessary for us to rely more heavily on trucks to transport our production, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation via pipeline. The construction of new pipelines and gathering systems is capital intensive and construction may be postponed, interrupted or cancelled in response to changing economic conditions and the availability and cost of capital. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build gathering systems to transport our production to transportation pipelines. In such event, costs to transport our production may increase materially or we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell our production at much lower prices than market or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of weather conditions (which may worsen due to climate changes), accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could adversely affect our cash flow.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest\nearly in the productive life of a well. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise, and are less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flows and the value of our reserves may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and potentially the borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement.\nEstimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the value of our reserves.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves. For instance, the SEC mandated prices used in estimating our proved reserves are $50.28 per Bbl of oil and $2.587 per MMBtu of natural gas, which are significantly higher than current spot market prices. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 44% of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations, however, actual capital expenditures will likely vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated.\nWe depend substantially on the continued presence of key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, particularly with respect to providing the critical management decisions and contacts necessary to manage and maintain growth within a highly competitive industry. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, particularly in the oil and natural gas industry, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions, we could be unable to attract and retain these personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe will be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nWe have completed in the past and may complete in the future significant acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy, which may include the acquisition of asset packages of producing properties or existing companies or businesses operating in our industry. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022 recoverable reserves;\n\u2022 future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022 development and operating costs; and\n\u2022 potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We are generally not able to obtain contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and normally acquire properties on an \"as is\" basis.\nSignificant acquisitions of existing companies or businesses and other strategic transactions may involve additional risks, including:\n\u2022 diversion of our management's attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022 the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with our own while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u2022 difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022 the challenge of integrating environmental compliance systems to meet requirements of rapidly changing regulations;\n\u2022 the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations; and\n\u2022 failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within our expected time frame.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to manage the integration process effectively, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is highly competitive.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in many respects, including identification of attractive oil and natural gas properties for acquisition, drilling and development, securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities. In seeking suitable opportunities, we compete with a number of other companies, including large oil and natural gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources, larger numbers of personnel and facilities, and, in some cases, with more expertise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities.\nOur oil and natural gas activities are subject to various risks which are beyond our control.\nOur operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for, producing, transporting, marketing and selling oil and natural gas. Although we may take precautionary measures, many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances. Many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and natural gas in commercial quantities, the rate of production and the economics of the development of, and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest. Any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such risks and hazards include:\n\u2022 human error, accidents, labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities;\n\u2022 blowouts, fires, hurricanes, pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and equipment;\n\u2022 unavailability of materials and equipment;\n\u2022 engineering and construction delays;\n\u2022 unanticipated transportation costs and delays;\n\u2022 unfavorable weather conditions;\n\u2022 hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions;\n\u2022 environmental regulations and requirements;\n\u2022 accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids, drilling fluids or salt water, into the environment;\n\u2022 hazards resulting from the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or other contaminants in gas we produce;\n\u2022 changes in laws and regulations, including laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas activities or markets for the oil and natural gas produced;\n\u2022 fluctuations in supply and demand for oil and natural gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production; and\n\u2022 the availability of alternative fuels and the price at which they become available.\nAs a result of these risks, expenditures, quantities and rates of production, revenues and operating costs may be materially affected and may differ materially from those anticipated by us.\nOur exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage to further our development efforts. Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. We invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage, which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot guarantee that our leasehold acreage will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return. Our ability to achieve our target results are dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil and natural gas, costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. We cannot predict the cost of drilling and completing a well, and we may be forced to limit, delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022 pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022 equipment failures or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling and completion equipment and services;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes; and\n\u2022 compliance with governmental requirements.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that frequently are amended to impose more stringent requirements that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nCompanies that explore for and develop, produce, sell and transport oil and natural gas in the United States are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including complex tax and environmental, health and safety laws and the corresponding regulations, and are required to obtain various permits and approvals from federal, state and local agencies. If these permits are not issued or unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:\n\u2022 water discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations;\n\u2022 drilling bonds;\n\u2022 drilling permits;\n\u2022 reports concerning operations;\n\u2022 air quality, air emissions, noise levels and related permits;\n\u2022 spacing of wells;\n\u2022 rights-of-way and easements;\n\u2022 unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u2022 pipeline construction;\n\u2022 gathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 taxation; and\n\u2022 waste transport and disposal permits and requirements.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to liabilities, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Compliance costs can be significant. Moreover, the laws governing our operations or the enforcement thereof could change in ways that substantially increase the costs of doing business. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we also could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage (including site clean-up and restoration costs) and other damages including the assessment of natural resource damages. Such laws may impose strict as well as joint and several liability for environmental contamination, which could subject us to liability for the conduct of others or for our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such actions were taken. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects. Part of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, federal requirements for performing or preparing environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing exploration and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to regulation by oil and natural gas producing states relating to conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may produce and sell. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or necessary permits, the failure to obtain a permit or the receipt of a permit with excessive conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on, develop or produce our properties. Additionally, the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our profitability.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nWe engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with many of the wells for which we are the operator. Federal, state, tribal and local governments have been adopting or considering restrictions on or prohibitions of fracturing in areas where we currently conduct operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations. Consequently, we could be subject to additional levels of regulation, operational delays or increased operating costs and could have additional regulatory burdens imposed upon us that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nFrom time to time, for example, legislation has been proposed in Congress to amend the federal SDWA to require federal permitting of hydraulic fracturing and the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, the EPA is conducting a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In December 2015, the EPA issued a draft final report for public comment and peer review. Other governmental reviews have also been recently conducted or are under way that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. For example, a federal BLM rulemaking for hydraulic fracturing practices on federal and Indian lands resulted in a 2015 final rule\nthat requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, confirmation that the wells used in fracturing operations meet proper construction standards and development of plans for managing related flowback water. These activities could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nCertain states, including North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas where we conduct operations, likewise are considering or have adopted more stringent requirements for various aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, such as permitting, disclosure, air emissions, well construction, seismic monitoring, waste disposal and water use. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Such efforts have extended to bans on hydraulic fracturing. On December 19, 2013, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned several portions of Pennsylvania's law regulating hydraulic fracturing, allowing local governments in Pennsylvania to regulate hydraulic fracturing through local land use regulations. Other local jurisdictions, including Dallas, Texas and several cities in Colorado, have adopted or tried to adopt restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, and anti-hydraulic fracturing activists are seeking more such controls.\nThe proliferation of regulations may limit our ability to operate. If the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and natural gas.\nStudies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and international negotiations over climate change and greenhouse gases are continuing. Meanwhile, several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems.\nIn the United States, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emission targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs.\nAt the federal level, the Obama Administration is attempting to address climate change through a variety of administrative actions. The EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that cover oil and natural gas facilities, among other industries. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an \"Endangerment Finding\" under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding certain greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. In March 2014, moreover, the President released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that included consideration of both voluntary programs and targeted regulations for the oil and gas sector. Towards that end, the EPA released five draft white papers on methane and volatile organic compound emissions and mitigation measures for natural gas compressors, hydraulically fractured oil wells, pneumatic devices, well liquids\nunloading facilities and natural gas production and transmission facilities. Building on its white papers and the public input on those documents, the EPA issued a proposed rule in 2015 that would set additional standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from oil and gas production sources, including hydraulically fractured oil wells and natural gas processing and transmission sources. The EPA intends to issue a final rule in 2016. In addition, the BLM has proposed standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The EPA and BLM actions are part of a series of steps by the Administration that are intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels.\nIn the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by governments and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property.\nAny laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions controls, to obtain emission allowances or to pay emission taxes, and reduce demand for our products.\nRequirements to reduce gas flaring in North Dakota could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWells in the Bakken / Three Forks formations in North Dakota, where we have significant operations, yield natural gas as a byproduct of oil production. Bottlenecks in the gas gathering network in certain areas resulted in some of that natural gas being flared instead of processed. In 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), the State's chief energy regulator, issued an order to reduce the volume of natural gas flared from oil wells in the Bakken / Three Forks formations. The State's objectives are to cause operators to capture 85% of the natural gas by November 1, 2016, and 90%, with the potential for 95%, by the fourth quarter 2020. In addition, the NDIC is requiring operators to develop gas capture plans that describe how much natural gas is expected to be produced, how it will be delivered to a processor and where it will be processed. Production caps or penalties will be imposed on certain wells that cannot meet the capture goals. These capture requirements and any similar future obligations in North Dakota or our other locations, may increase our operational costs or restrict our production, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCrude oil from the Bakken / Three Forks formations may pose unique hazards that may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) has concluded that crude oil from the Bakken / Three Forks formations has a higher volatility than most other crude oil from the United States and thus is more ignitable and flammable. Based on that information, and several fires involving rail transportation of crude oil, USDOT has issued a final rule with new requirements for shipping crude oil by rail. In addition, the rail industry has adopted increased precautions for crude shipments. Any restrictions that significantly affect transportation of crude oil production could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation of the Three Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota are subject to various federal and tribal regulations and laws, any of which may increase our costs and delay our operations.\nVarious federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (formerly the Minerals Management Service) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with the Three Affiliated Tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to\noperations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation on which we hold approximately 28,000 net acres. In addition, the Three Affiliated Tribes is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees and other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations on Native American tribal lands. Lessees and operators conducting operations on tribal lands can be subject to the Native American tribal court system. One or more of these factors may increase our costs of doing business on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and may have an adverse impact on our ability to effectively transport products within the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation or to conduct our operations on such lands.\nOur operations substantially depend on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or recycle water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nWater is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Wastewaters from our operations typically are disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to greater public scrutiny of disposal wells. Any new environmental initiatives or regulations that restrict injection of fluids, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and gas, or that limit the withdrawal, storage or use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells, could increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing implementation of federal legislation enacted in 2010 could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effects of commodity prices, interest rates and other risks associated with our business.\nHistorically, we have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts in order to hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or CFTC), along with other federal agencies, to promulgate regulations implementing the new legislation. The CFTC, in coordination with the SEC and various United States federal banking regulators, has issued regulations to implement the so-called \"Volcker Rule\" under which banking entities are generally prohibited from proprietary trading of derivatives. Although conditional exemptions from this general prohibition are available, the Volcker Rule may limit the trading activities of banking entities that have been counterparties to our derivatives trades in the past.\nThe CFTC also has finalized other regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions regarding trade reporting, margin and position limits; however, some regulations remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will adopt final rules. For example, the CFTC has re-proposed regulations setting position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions are expected to be made exempt from these limits. Also, it is possible that under recently adopted margin rules, some CFTC registered swap dealers may require us to post initial and variation margins in connection with certain swaps not subject to central clearing.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any additional implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which\ncould adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some commodity derivative contracts, limit our ability to trade some derivatives to hedge risks, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a consequence, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. If the implementing regulations result in lower commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities.\nWe maintain general and excess liability policies, which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards. These policies generally cover:\n\u2022 personal injury;\n\u2022 bodily injury;\n\u2022 third party property damage;\n\u2022 medical expenses;\n\u2022 legal defense costs;\n\u2022 pollution in some cases;\n\u2022 well blowouts in some cases; and\n\u2022 workers compensation.\nAs is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover claims made against us in the future.\nTitle to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.\nWe generally obtain title opinions on significant properties that we drill or acquire. However, there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Generally, under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties, any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and crews, other equipment, supplies, water, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, water or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of,\nqualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. Increasing levels of exploration and production may increase the demand for oilfield services and equipment, and the costs of these services and equipment may increase, while the quality of these services and equipment may suffer. The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, supplies or qualified personnel can materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. In order to secure drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we have entered into certain contracts that extend over several months and or years. If demand for drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment subside during the period covered by these contracts, the price we are required to pay may be significantly more than the market rate for similar services.\nWe depend on the skill, ability and decisions of third-party operators of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have a non-operated working interest.\nThe success of the drilling, development and production of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have or expect to have a non-operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third-party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws, rules and regulations affecting such properties. The failure of any third-party operator to make decisions, perform their services, discharge their obligations, deal with regulatory agencies, and comply with laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties, including substantial penalties and compliance costs. Such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties, which could materially affect our results of operations.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, we have entered into oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our anticipated production and we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile commodity prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if commodity prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022 our production is less than expected;\n\u2022 there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production; or\n\u2022 the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts.", "PERMNO": 91283, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BATL"}
