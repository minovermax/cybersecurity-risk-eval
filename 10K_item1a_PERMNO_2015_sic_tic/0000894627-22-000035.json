{"cik": "894627", "company": "VAALCO ENERGY INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Any risks discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report and in our other SEC filings could also have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Strategy\nEvents outside of our control, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe face risks related to epidemics, outbreaks or other public health events that are outside of our control. The global or national outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could significantly disrupt our business and operational plans and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity. Although we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7we may experience disruption to our supply chain for materials essential to our business, including restrictions on importing and exporting products;\n\uf0b7we may receive notices from customers, suppliers and other third parties arguing that their non-performance under our contracts with them is permitted as a result of force majeure or other reasons;\n\uf0b7we have experienced a cybersecurity attack and may face cybersecurity issues in the future, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity;\n\uf0b7we may face litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements;\n\uf0b7we may be required to implement reductions of our workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and we may face an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\uf0b7we may incur additional asset impairments;\n\uf0b7we have and may continue to experience quarantines involving our employees and other third parties in areas in which we operate, and any such quarantines could result in a well shut-in, temporary closure of offshore platforms or the FPSO charter vehicle or other disruptions in production;\n\uf0b7we have faced and may continue to face logistical challenges, including those resulting from border closures and travel restrictions, as well as the possibility that our ability to continue production may be interrupted, limited or curtailed if workers and/or materials are unable to reach our offshore platforms and FPSO charter vessel or our counterparties are unable to lift crude oil from our FPSO charter vessel;\n\uf0b7we may be subject to actions undertaken by national, regional and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects, including travel restrictions and temporary closures of our facilities, that could result in operations and supply chains being interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable; and\n\uf0b7we may experience a structural shift in the global economy and its demand for crude oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions will persist, the full extent of the impact they will have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity, or the pace or extent of\nany subsequent recovery. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments - Impact on Operations of COVID-19 Pandemic and the Current Crude Oil Pricing Environment\u201d.\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures, and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing to fund our exploration and development activities or potential acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur exploration and development activities, as well as our active pursuit of complementary opportunistic acquisitions, are capital intensive. To replace and grow our reserves, we must make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploitation, development, exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash from operations, debt, asset sales, and private sales of equity. We are the operator of the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon and are responsible for contracting on behalf of all the remaining parties participating in the project. In addition, on February 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sasol\u2019s 27.8% working interest in the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon. Prior to the completion of the Sasol Acquisition, we relied on the timely payment of cash calls by our joint venture owners to pay for 66.4% of the offshore Gabon budget, but from and after the completion of the Sasol Acquisition, we rely on our joint venture owners to pay for 36.4% of the offshore Gabon budget. With respect to Block P, the EG MMH approved our appointment as technical operator in August 2020. Further, we acquired an additional working interest of 12% from Atlas Petroleum, thereby increasing our working interest to 43% in 2020. Since we have been appointed, we will rely on the timely payment of cash calls by our joint venture owners to pay for 46.3% (including the 20% carry of GEPetrol\u2019s costs) of the Equatorial Guinea budget. The continued economic health of our joint venture owners could be adversely affected by low crude oil prices, thereby adversely affecting their ability to make timely payment of cash calls.\nIf low crude oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties or declines in reserves result in our revenues being less than expected or limit our ability to enter into debt financing arrangements, or our joint venture owners fail to pay their share of project costs, we may be unable to obtain or expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs or to acquire additional reserves.\nWe do not currently have any commitments for future external funding for capital expenditures or acquisitions beyond cash generated from operating activities. Our ability to secure additional or replacement financing may be limited. We cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet our capital requirements and fund acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. Even if we succeed in selling additional equity securities to raise funds, at such time the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities or our ability to make future acquisitions. If cash generated by operations or cash available under any financing sources is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the development of our properties or prevent us from consummating acquisitions of additional reserves. Such a curtailment in operations or activities could lead to a decline in our estimated net proved reserves, and would likely materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we are able to replace the proved reserve quantities that we have produced through acquiring or developing additional reserves, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had four PUDS. As discussed above in \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information - Gabon Segment\u201d, we commenced our 2019/2020 drilling program during September 2019 and completed the program with the last well being completed in March 2020. Further, the 2021/2022 program commenced in Etame in December of 2021 with Etame 8H-ST well and is expected to include two development wells and two appraisal wells.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional crude oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. In general, production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of crude oil and natural gas reserves would be limited to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our estimated net proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced.\nThere can be no assurance that our development and exploration projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells at economic finding costs. The drilling of crude oil and natural gas wells involves a high degree of risk, especially the risk of dry holes or of wells that are not sufficiently productive to provide an economic return on the capital expended to drill the wells. Additionally, seismic and other technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including declines in crude oil or natural gas prices and/or prolonged periods of historically low crude oil and natural gas prices, weather conditions, political instability, availability of capital, economic/currency imbalances, compliance with governmental requirements, receipt of additional seismic data or the reprocessing of existing data, failure of wells drilled in similar formations, equipment failures (such as ESPs), delays in the delivery of equipment and availability of drilling rigs. If we are unable to increase our proved quantities, there will likely be a material impact on our cash flows, business and operations.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 36 percent of our total estimated proved reserves were undeveloped and we had four PUD well locations included in our reserves. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. Our reserves data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct. Our reserve report at December 31, 2021 includes estimates of total future development costs over the next five years associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately $61 million, net to VAALCO\u2019s working interest at December 31, 2021. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to write-off these reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be recognized only if they relate to wells planned to be drilled within five years of the date of their initial recognition, we may be required to write-off any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nAll of the value of our current production and reserves is concentrated in a single block offshore Gabon, and any production problems or reductions in reserve estimates related to this property would adversely impact our business.\nThe Etame Marin block consists of 14 producing wells. Production from the block constituted 100% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, at December 31, 2021, 100% of our total reserves were attributable to the block. Further, if mechanical problems, storms or other events, including COVID-19 infections and quarantines, curtailed a substantial portion of this production, or if the actual reserves associated with this producing property are less than our estimated reserves, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our properties are currently concentrated in the same geographic area, many of our rights under the Etame PSC will be affected by the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than with respect to companies that have a more diversified portfolio of licenses and properties located across diverse geographic areas.\nWe may not enter into definitive agreements with the BWE Consortium to explore and exploit new properties, and we may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts, the associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves operated by the BWE Consortium or from any non-operated properties we have an interest in.\nOn October 11, 2021 we announced our entry into a consortium with BW Energy and Panoro Energy (the \u201cBWE Consortium\u201d) and that the BWE Consortium had been provisionally awarded two blocks, G12-13 and H12-13, in the 12th Offshore Licensing Round in Gabon. The award is subject to concluding the terms of the production sharing contracts with the Gabonese government. BW Energy will be the operator with a 37.5% working interest and we and Panoro Energy will have a 37.5% working interest and 25% working interest, respectively, as non-operating joint owners. The joint owners in the BWE Consortium intend to reprocess existing seismic and carry out a 3-D seismic campaign on these two blocks and have also committed to drilling exploration wells on both blocks. Our obligations within the BWE Consortium are subject to a number of conditions, including the negotiation and execution of production sharing contracts with the Gabonese government, as well the entry into joint operating agreements with our joint interest owners. There is no assurance that we will be able to agree to terms on definitive production sharing contracts with the Gabonese government nor joint operating agreements with the joint owners in the BWE Consortium. If we are unable to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with each party, we may not be able to explore, develop and exploit new properties, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may have limited control, over matters relating to the development and exploitation activities, including the timing of and capital expenditures for such activities, in projects where we are not the operator, including properties operated by the BWE Consortium. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on such properties, depends upon a number of factors, including:\n\uf0b7the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\uf0b7the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\uf0b7the operator\u2019s expertise, financial resources and willingness to initiate exploration or development projects;\n\uf0b7approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\uf0b7risk of other a non-operator\u2019s failure to pay its share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party\u2019s share of costs;\n\uf0b7selection of technology;\n\uf0b7delays in the pace of exploratory drilling or development;\n\uf0b7the rate of production of the reserves; and/or\n\uf0b7the operator\u2019s desire to drill more wells or build more facilities on a project inconsistent with our capital budget, whether on a cash basis or through financing, which may limit our participation in those projects or limit the percentage of our revenues from those projects.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated exploration and development activities.\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment. Our production facilities are subject to hazards such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision and damage from severe weather conditions. The relatively deep offshore drilling conducted by us involves increased drilling risks of high pressures and mechanical difficulties, including stuck pipe, collapsed casing and separated cable. We have experienced pipeline blockages in the past and may experience additional pipeline blockages in the future. The impact that any of these risks may have upon us is increased due to the low number of producing properties we own. We could incur substantial expenses that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or license acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and license interests.\nExploration and development operations offshore Africa often lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in other regions. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between an offshore discovery and the marketing of the associated crude oil and natural gas, increasing both the financial and operational risks involved with these operations. Offshore drilling operations generally require more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of equipment failure and usually higher drilling costs. In addition, there may be production risks for which we are currently unaware. For example, the production of hydrogen sulfide at certain of our Etame Marin block wells creates unexpected production losses and delays in our development plans; see \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information - Hydrogen Sulfide Impact.\u201d The development of new subsea infrastructure and use of floating production systems to transport crude oil from producing wells may require substantial time for installation or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in loss of production, significant liabilities, cost overruns or delays.\nIn addition, in the event of a well control incident, containment and, potentially, cleanup activities for offshore drilling are costly. The resulting regulatory costs or penalties, and the results of third-party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well control incident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial position, and stock price.\nIf we are not able to timely implement the transition to the FSO unit before the expiration of the FPSO contract in September 2022, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAs an offshore producer, we depend on our FPSO to store all of the crude oil we produce prior to sale to our customers. Our current FPSO contract expires in September 2022. On August 31, 2021, we and our Etame co-venturers approved the Bareboat Contract and Operating Agreement with World Carrier Offshore Services Corp. to replace the existing FPSO with a FSO unit at the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon for up to eight years with additional option periods available upon the expiration of the current FPSO contract in September 2022. The transition to the FSO unit will require a significant lead time and may require a capital investment due to the specialized nature of such vessels. To become operational, significant engineering studies, platform modifications, mooring and pipeline surveys as well as installation must be completed. If we are not able to timely implement the transition to the FSO unit as our alternative method of storing the crude oil we produce, then we will not be able to sell crude oil to our customers. Consequently, we would be required to shut in production until such time that we could offload the oil, and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nAcquisitions and divestitures of properties and businesses may subject us to additional risks and uncertainties, including that acquired assets may not produce as projected, may subject us to additional liabilities and may not be successfully integrated with our business. In addition, any sales or divestments of properties we make may result in certain liabilities that we are required to retain under the terms of such sales or divestments.\nOne of our growth strategies is to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions of crude oil and natural gas reserves and/or the companies that own them and other strategic transactions that fit within our overall business strategy. Any future acquisition will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards, potential tax and employer liabilities, regulatory requirements and other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher valued properties and are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to review in depth every potential liability on each individual property involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and potential problems, such as ground water contamination and other environmental conditions and deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Any unidentified problems could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact our financial condition.\nAdditional potential risks related to acquisitions include, among other things:\n\uf0b7incorrect assumptions regarding the reserves, future production and revenues, or future operating or development costs with respect to the acquired properties, as well as future prices of crude oil and natural gas;\n\uf0b7decreased liquidity as a result of using a significant portion of our cash from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\uf0b7significant increases in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\uf0b7the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs (including potential regulatory actions) that we are not indemnified for or that our indemnity, insurance or other protection is inadequate to protect against;\n\uf0b7an increase in our costs or a decrease in our revenues associated with any claims or disputes with governments or other interest owners;\n\uf0b7an incurrence of non-cash charges in connection with an acquisition and the potential future impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in an acquisition;\n\uf0b7the risk that crude oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\uf0b7difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\uf0b7the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns during the acquisition and throughout the integration process;\n\uf0b7losses of key employees at the acquired businesses;\n\uf0b7difficulties in operating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\uf0b7delays in achieving the expected synergies from acquisitions;\n\uf0b7the failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\uf0b7the failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings; and\n\uf0b7challenges in coordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions of businesses often require the approval of certain government or regulatory agencies and such approval could contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to our business after a merger.\nIn the case of sales or divestitures of our properties and businesses, we may become exposed to future liabilities that arise under the terms of those sales or divestitures. Under such terms, sellers typically are required to retain certain liabilities for matters with respect to their sold properties or businesses. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations. In addition, we may be required to recognize losses in accordance with exit or disposal activities.\nWe may experience a financial loss if our significant customer fails to pay us for our crude oil or natural gas or reduce the volume of crude oil and natural gas that they purchase from us.\nWe have been reliant on a small number of significant customers for sales of our crude oil production. Currently, ExxonMobil is our customer, and sales of crude oil to ExxonMobil accounted for approximately 100% of revenues sold to customers for the 2021 fiscal year. In December 2020, our contract with ExxonMobil was extended until July 2021 and in July 2021, the contract with ExxonMobil was subsequently amended to extend the date of the contract through the end of January 2022. In January 2022, our contract with ExxonMobil was extended until July 2022. Our ability to collect payments from the sale of crude oil and natural gas to our customers depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which may include a small number of significant customers. If our significant customers fail to pay us for any reason, we could experience a material loss. In addition, if our significant customers cease to purchase our crude oil or natural gas or reduce the volume of the crude oil or natural gas that they purchase from us, the loss or reduction could have a detrimental effect on our production volumes and may cause a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our crude oil and natural gas.\nOur reserve information represents estimates that may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions on which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present values of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The estimates included in this document are based on various assumptions required by the SEC, including non-escalated prices and costs and capital expenditures subsequent to December 31, 2021, and, therefore, are inherently imprecise indications of future net revenues. Actual future production, revenues, taxes, operating expenses, development expenditures and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves.\nIn addition, our reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, availability of funds to acquire additional reserves, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors. Moreover, the calculation of the estimated present value of the future net revenue using a 10% discount rate as required by the SEC is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general. It is also possible that reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and future net revenues based on the same available data.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using an average of the first day of the month prices received for crude oil and natural gas for the preceding twelve months. Future reductions in prices, below the average calculated for 2021, would result in the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves being reduced.\nOur proved reserves are in foreign countries and are or will be subject to service contracts, production sharing contracts and other arrangements. The quantity of crude oil and natural gas that we will ultimately receive under these arrangements will differ based on numerous factors, including the price of crude oil and natural gas, production rates, production costs, cost recovery provisions and local tax and royalty regimes. Changes in many of these factors could affect the estimates of proved reserves in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf our assumptions underlying accruals for abandonment costs are too low, we could be required to expend greater amounts than expected.\nAlmost all of our properties, which have future abandonment obligations, are located offshore. The costs to abandon offshore wells and the related infrastructure may be substantial. For financial accounting purposes, we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period that it is incurred and capitalize the related costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The estimated liability is reflected in the \u201cAsset retirement obligation\u201d line item of our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs part of the Etame Marin block production license, we are subject to an agreed upon cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. Based upon the most recent abandonment study completed in November 2021, the abandonment cost estimate used for this purpose is approximately $81.3 million ($47.8 million net to VAALCO\u2019s 58.8% working interest) on an undiscounted basis. On an annual basis over the remaining life of the production license, we must fund a portion of these estimated abandonment costs. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information - Gabon Segment - Abandonment Costs,\u201d for further information. Future changes to the anticipated abandonment cost estimates could change our asset retirement obligations and increase the amount of future abandonment funding payments we are obligated to make.\nWe could lose our interest in Block P if we do not meet our commitments under the production sharing contract.\nOur Block P production sharing contract provides for a development and production period of 25 years from the date of approval of a development and production plan. We and our joint venture owners are evaluating the timing and budgeting for development and exploration activities in the block, including the approval of a development and production plan. We have completed a feasibility study of a standalone production development opportunity of the Venus discovery on Block P, but there can be no certainty any such transaction will be completed or that we will be able to commence drilling operations in Block P. If the joint venture owners of Block P fail to meet the commitments under the production sharing contract amendment, our capitalized costs of $10.0 million associated with Block P interest would be impaired.\nCommodity derivative transactions we enter into may fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices and could result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nIn order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we have entered into and may continue to enter into derivative arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our derivative contracts typically consist of a series of commodity swap contracts, such as puts, collars and fixed price swaps, and are limited in duration. For example, on January 22, 2021 we entered into crude oil commodity swap agreements for a total of 709,262 barrels at a Dated Brent weighted average price of $53.10 per barrel for the period from and including February 2021 through January 2022. On May 6, 2021, the Company entered into commodity swaps at a Dated Brent weighted average price of $66.51 per barrel for the period from and including May 2021 through October 2021 for a quantity of 672,533 barrels. On August 6, 2021, the Company entered into additional commodity swaps at a Dated Brent weighted average price of $67.70 per barrel for the period from and including November 2021 through February 2022 for a quantity of 314,420 barrels. On September 24, 2021, the Company entered into additional commodity swaps at a Dated Brent weighted average price of $72.00 per barrel for the period from and including March 2022 to June 2022 for a quantity of 460,000 barrels.\nThe following are the hedges outstanding at December 31, 2021:\nThe following are the additional hedges entered into in 2022:\nThe hedge counterparty will be obligated to make payments to us to the extent that the floating (market) price is below an agreed fixed (strike) price. However, hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations. Disruptions in the market could also occur that lead to sudden changes in the liquidity of the counterparties to our hedge transactions which in turn limit their ability to perform under their hedging contracts with us. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nDerivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments or when there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price and actual prices received in the derivative instrument. In addition, certain types of derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the prices for crude oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs a crude oil producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Costs for insurance may also increase as a result of security threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated. We rely extensively on information technology systems, including internet sites, computer software, and data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our business. Our technologies systems and networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including without limitation malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems and materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including the following:\n\uf0b7unauthorized access to and release of seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for crude oil and natural gas resources;\n\uf0b7data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\uf0b7data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharge;\n\uf0b7unauthorized access to and release of personal identifying information of employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect that information;\n\uf0b7a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt operations;\n\uf0b7a cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities, which could delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\uf0b7a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues; and\n\uf0b7business interruptions, including use of social engineering schemes and/or ransomware, could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nTo protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented multiple layers of cybersecurity protections, infrastructure protection technologies, disaster recovery plans and employee training. While we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our technology systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over sensitive data, there can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective.\nIn addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the U.S., we adopted a hybrid work-from-home policy in September 2021, and we expect this practice to continue for the foreseeable future. For our Gabon offices our employees are working in the offices on a full time basis and expected to work normal business hours.\nRemote work and remote access increase our vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks. We may see an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products and services and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we could be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.\nAny cyber incident could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. Additionally, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nProduction cuts mandated by the government of Gabon, a member of OPEC, could adversely affect our revenues, cash flow and results of operations.\nAfter terminating its membership with OPEC in 1995, Gabon rejoined OPEC as a full member in July 2016. Historically and from time to time, members of OPEC have entered into agreements to reduce worldwide production of crude oil, including the agreement reached in April 2020 among OPEC member countries and other leading allied producing countries (collectively, \u201cOPEC+\u201d) to reduce the gap between excess supply and demand in an effort to stabilize the international oil market. Gabon undertook measures to comply with such\nOPEC+ production quota agreement. As a result, the Minister of Hydrocarbons in Gabon requested that we reduce our production beginning in July 2020 and continuing through April 30, 2021 in compliance with the OPEC+ mandate, and we took measures to reduce our production. Currently, our production is not impacted by OPEC+ curtailments, however any future reduction in VAALCO\u2019s crude oil production or export activities for a substantial period could materially and adversely affect our revenues, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe have less control over our investments in foreign properties than we would have with respect to domestic investments, and added risk in foreign countries may affect our foreign investments.\nOur international assets and operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including, among other things, the risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, changing political conditions, international monetary fluctuations, currency controls, decisions of international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, CEMAC and the Banking Commission of Central Africa, changes in laws and regulations relating to banking institutions and deposit accounts, requirements to hold funds in government-owned banks and the risk of foreign banking institution failure, possible changes in government personnel, the development of new administrative policies, practices and political conditions that may affect the enforcement or administration of laws and regulations, adoption of new or amendments to regulatory regimes for foreign investment, uncertainties as to whether the laws and regulations will be applicable in any particular circumstance, uncertainty as to whether we will be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable governing authorities, compliance with governmental or contractual requirements, and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nFor example, the Gabonese government\u2019s oil company may seek to participate in crude oil and natural gas projects in a manner that could be dilutive to the interest of current license holders and the Gabonese government is under pressure from the Gabonese labor union to require companies to hire a higher percentage of Gabonese citizens. In 2016, the government of Gabon conducted an audit of our operations in Gabon, covering the years 2013 through 2014. We received the findings from this audit and responded to the audit findings in January 2017. Since providing our response, there have been changes in the Gabonese officials responsible for the audit. We are working with the current representatives to resolve the audit findings. Between 2019 and 2021, the government of Gabon conducted an audit of our operations in Gabon, covering the years 2015 and 2016. We have not yet received the findings from this audit. While we do not anticipate that the assessments related to these audits will have a significant, if any, negative impact on our reported earnings or cash flows, we can make no assurances that this will be the case. In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign crude oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of the United States.\nIn December 2021, the Bank of Central African States (\u201cBEAC\u201d), which is the central bank for the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (\u201cCEMAC\u201d) passed new regulations and instructions for the CEMAC FX regulations which was introduced in 2018 that only apply to the extractive industry. This was done by BEAC after prolonged discussions and negotiations with the extractive industries operating in the CEMAC region. The intent of the new regulations is to ensure the application of the FX regulations as of January 1, 2022, without impeding the operations of the extractive industry. Due to the lack of necessary banking infrastructure and preparedness by the banking sector and the various government agencies to apply the new regulations, it is foreseeable that we will run the risk of seeing delays in paying our vendors and domiciliation of goods and services into the CEMAC region throughout 2022 and possibly beyond.\nAs part of securing the first of two five-year extensions to the Etame PSC in 2016, we agreed to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. On March 5, 2019, in accordance with certain foreign currency regulatory requirements, the Gabonese branch of the international commercial bank holding the abandonment funds in a U.S. dollar denominated account converted at the request of BEAC the funds in U.S. dollars to franc CFA the currency of the CEMAC, of which Gabon is one of the six member-states. The Etame PSC provides these payments must be denominated in U.S. dollars and the CEMAC FX regulations provide for establishment of a U.S. dollar account with BEAC. Although we requested establishment of such account, BEAC did not comply with our requests until February 2021. As a result, we were not able to make the annual abandonment funding payments in 2019 and 2020. In February 2021, BEAC authorized us to apply for a U.S. dollar denominated escrow account for the abandonment fund at Citibank Gabon (\u201cCitibank\u201d). Working with Citibank, on March 12, 2021 we filed the application to open the account and are currently awaiting the approval of the account from the Central Bank. Accordingly, we were not able to make our funding payment in 2021. In December 2021, as part of the new FX regulations issued by BEAC, they allowed for opening of U.S. dollars escrow accounts for the abandonment funds at BEAC and are currently working with the extractive industry to formulate the agreements which are expected to be finalized in 2022 that regulates these accounts. Accordingly, pursuant to Amendment No. 5 of the Etame PSC that required these funds to be in U.S. dollars, once the account for the U.S. dollars abandonment fund is open at BEAC we will resume our funding of the abandonment fund in compliance with the Etame PSC. For additional information, see \u201c-Our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and regulations.\u201d\nPrivate ownership of crude oil and natural gas reserves under crude oil and natural gas leases in the United States differs distinctly from our rights in foreign reserves where the state generally retains ownership of the minerals, and in many cases participates in, the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves. Accordingly, operations outside the United States may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments, export taxes and regulations, surcharges, value added taxes, production bonuses and other\ncharges. For instance, the terms of the Etame PSC include provisions for, among other things, payments to the government of Gabon for a 13% royalty interest based on crude oil production at published prices and payments for a shared portion of \u201cprofit oil\u201d, based on daily production rates, which such \u201cprofit oil\u201d has been and can continue to be taken in-kind through taking crude oil barrels rather than making cash payments.\nAll of our proved reserves are related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon. We have operated in Gabon since 1995 and believe we have good relations with the current Gabonese government. However, there can be no assurance that present or future administrations or governmental regulations in Gabon will not materially adversely affect our operations or cash flows.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by political and economic circumstances in the countries in which we operate.\nOur exploration, development and production activities are subject to political and economic uncertainties (including but not limited to changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in energy policies or the personnel administering them), expropriation of property, cancellation or modification of contract rights, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities, redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes, foreign exchange restrictions, currency fluctuations, royalty and tax increases and other risks arising out of governmental sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, as well as risks of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, acts of terrorism, piracy, disease, guerrilla activities, insurrection and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties. Some of these risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct our activities, namely, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.\nOur operations are exposed to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may include:\n\uf0b7volatility in global crude oil prices, which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\uf0b7negative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility;\n\uf0b7difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;\n\uf0b7inability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;\n\uf0b7disruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;\n\uf0b7inability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;\n\uf0b7reduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;\n\uf0b7damage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;\n\uf0b7the incurrence of significant costs for security personnel and systems;\n\uf0b7damage to or destruction of property belonging to our commodity purchasers leading to interruption of deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of commodity sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;\n\uf0b7inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations resulting in a halt or delay in our planned exploration activities, delayed development of major projects, or shut-in of producing fields;\n\uf0b7lack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;\n\uf0b7the imposition of U.S. government or international sanctions that limit our ability to conduct our business;\n\uf0b7shutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and\n\uf0b7capital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our joint owners to obtain financing for potential development projects.\nWhile we monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate, loss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, losses caused by these disruptions may not be covered by insurance, or even if they are covered by insurance, we may not have enough insurance to cover all of these losses. If any violent action causes us to become involved in a dispute, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside the United States or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States or international arbitration, which could adversely affect the outcome of such dispute.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and by currency regulations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our foreign operations. While crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, portions of our costs in Gabon are denominated in the local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar will have the effect of increasing costs while a strengthening U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing operating costs. The Gabon local currency is tied to the Euro. The exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated widely in recent years in response to international political conditions, general\neconomic conditions, the European sovereign debt crisis and other factors beyond our control. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us for any deposits of that currency, such as our deposits in the Etame PSC abandonment account, which have been converted from U.S. dollar to Gabon local currency. See the risk factor \u201cWe have less control over our investments in foreign properties than we would have with respect to domestic investments, and added risk in foreign countries may affect our foreign investments.\u201d Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not actively traded.\nWe are also subject to risks relating to governmental regulation of foreign currency, which may limit our ability to:\n\uf0b7transfer funds from or convert currencies in certain countries;\n\uf0b7repatriate foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements; and\n\uf0b7repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates.\nWe operate in international jurisdictions, and we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government and other officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws, and our staff participate in training regarding compliance with these laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts of corruption committed by our employees or agents. Any additional expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected.\nWhile our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021, our management does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent or detect all possible errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by two or more persons acting in collusion. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in any control system designed under a cost-effective approach, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face.\nOur business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, crude oil and natural gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property, as well as injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, nationalization, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event that we are not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of the services of our Chief\n\u200eExecutive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, as well as any loss of the services of one or more other members of our senior management, could delay or prevent the achievement of our objectives. We do not maintain any \u201ckey-man\u201d insurance policies on any of our senior management, and do not intend to obtain such insurance. In addition, due to the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing drilling prospects and producing crude oil and natural gas from proved properties and maximizing production from crude oil and natural gas properties. There is competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and a depressed price regime, if prolonged, may negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues, cash flow, profitability, crude oil and natural gas reserves value and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Our ability to enter into debt financing arrangements and to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms is also substantially dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices.\nHistorically, world-wide crude oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for crude oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, increases in supplies from United States shale production, international political conditions, including uprisings and political unrest in the Middle East and Africa, the domestic and foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas, actions by OPEC+ member countries and other state-controlled oil companies to agree upon and maintain crude oil price and production controls, the level of consumer demand that is impacted by economic growth rates, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, technological advances affecting energy consumption, the health of international economic and credit markets, and changes in the level of demand resulting from global or national health epidemics and concerns, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, various factors, including the effect of federal, state and foreign regulation of production and transportation, general economic conditions, changes in supply due to drilling by other producers and changes in demand may adversely affect our ability to market our crude oil and natural gas production.\nA combination of factors, including a substantial decline in global demand for crude oil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation efforts, as well as market concerns about the ability of OPEC+ to agree on a perceived need to implement production cuts in response to weaker worldwide demand, caused an unprecedented decline in crude oil and natural gas prices during the first six months of 2020. Although crude oil prices increased to approximately $77 per barrel for Brent crude as of December 31, 2021 and have further improved since year-end, adverse economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the various other factors described above, could result in additional price declines.\nIn a period of depressed or declining crude oil and natural gas prices, such as the significant declines in crude oil and natural gas prices during the first six months of 2020, we are subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\uf0b7our revenues, cash flows and profitability may decline substantially, which could also indirectly impact expected production by reducing the amount of funds available to engage in exploration, drilling and production;\n\uf0b7third party confidence in our commercial or financial ability to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas could erode, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\uf0b7our suppliers, hedge counterparties (if any), vendors and service providers could renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us;\n\uf0b7we may take measures to preserve liquidity, such us our decision to cease or defer discretionary capital expenditures during such periods of depressed or declining oil prices; and\n\uf0b7it may become more difficult to retain, attract or replace key employees.\nThe occurrence of certain of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExploring for, developing, or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain.\nWe may not be able to economically find, develop, or acquire additional reserves, or may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to develop our reserves, if our cash flows from operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for crude oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and cost overruns are common. In particular, offshore drilling and development operations require highly capital-intensive techniques.\nOur drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including weather conditions, equipment failures or accidents, elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations, compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services. If we are unable to continue drilling operations and we do not replace the reserves we produce or acquire additional reserves, our reserves, revenues and cash flow will decrease over time, which could have a material effect on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nMaterial declines in crude oil and natural gas prices have required us, and may require us in the future, to take write-downs in the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using the average price received for crude oil and natural gas based on closing prices of the average of the first day of the month price over the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. However, for the purpose of impairment analysis, the estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with ASC 932 and are priced using forecasted realized prices at the end of the quarter. During 2021 and 2019 no impairments were necessary with respect to the Etame Marin block. However, during the first quarter of 2020, the undiscounted cash flows related to the Etame Marin block was less than the book value, resulting in the Company recording an impairment loss of $30.6 million to write down the Company\u2019s investment in the Etame Marin block.\nAs described elsewhere herein, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting substantial decline in the demand for crude oil coupled with the current global oversupply of crude oil resulted in a substantial decline in the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices decline further, we expect that the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves will be reduced, which may necessitate further write-downs. Any future write-downs or impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. We compete with, and may be outbid by, competitors in our attempts to acquire exploration and production rights in crude oil and natural gas properties. These properties include exploration prospects as well as properties with proved reserves. There is also competition for contracting for drilling equipment and the hiring of experienced personnel. Factors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include, among other things:\n\uf0b7our access to the capital necessary to drill wells and acquire properties;\n\uf0b7our ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\uf0b7our ability to retain and hire experienced personnel, especially for our engineering, geoscience and accounting departments; and\n\uf0b7the location of, and our ability to access, platforms, pipelines and other facilities used to produce and transport crude oil and natural gas production.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies and substantial independent energy companies, many of which possess greater financial, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These companies may be better able to: competitively bid for and purchase crude oil and natural gas properties; evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit; continue drilling during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices; contract for drilling equipment; and secure trained personnel. Our competitors may also use superior technology that we may be unable to afford or that would require costly investment by us in order to compete.\nCompetition due to advances in renewable fuels may lessen the demand for our products and negatively impact our profitability.\nAlternatives to petroleum-based products and production methods are continually under development. For example, a number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells or clean-burning gaseous fuels that may address increasing worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns, which if successful could lower the demand for crude oil and natural gas. If these non-petroleum based products and crude oil alternatives continue to expand and gain broad acceptance such that the overall demand for crude oil and natural gas is decreased, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and the value of our assets.\nWeather, unexpected subsurface conditions and other unforeseen operating hazards may adversely impact our crude oil and natural gas activities.\nThe crude oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as crude oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures and discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of well fluids including chemical additives, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure for liability. The occurrence of a significant unfavorable event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or at all.\nAn increased societal and governmental focus on ESG and climate change issues may adversely impact our business, impact our access to investors and financing, and decrease demand for our product.\nAn increased expectation that companies address environmental (including climate change), social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters may have a myriad of impacts to our business. Some investors and lenders are factoring these issues into investment and financing decisions. They may rely upon companies that assign ratings to a company\u2019s ESG performance. Unfavorable ESG ratings, as well as recent activism around fossil fuels, may dissuade investors or lenders from us to toward other industries, which could negatively impact our stock price or our access to capital.\nMoreover, while we have and may continue to create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.\nIn addition, ESG and climate chance issues may cause consumer preference to shift toward other alternative sources of energy, lowering demand for our products. In some areas these concerns have caused governments to adopt or consider adopting regulations to transition to a lower-carbon economy. These measures may include adoption of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, prohibitions on the manufacture of certain types of equipment (such as new automobiles with internal combustion engines), and requirements for the use of alternate energy sources such as wind or solar. These types of programs may reduce the demand for our product.\nApproaches to climate change and transition to a lower-carbon economy, including government regulation, company policies, and consumer behavior, are continuously evolving. At this time, we cannot predict how such approaches may develop or otherwise reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to compete. However, any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition against crude oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally. Companies in the crude oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, climate change, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development.\nFurther, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Moreover, activist shareholders in our industry have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive activities. While we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals, they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities.\nFuture activist efforts could result in the following:\n\uf0b7delay or denial of drilling permits;\n\uf0b7shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\uf0b7restrictions or delays on our ability to obtain additional seismic data;\n\uf0b7restrictions on installation or operation of gathering or processing facilities;\n\uf0b7restrictions on the use of certain operating practices;\n\uf0b7legal challenges or lawsuits;\n\uf0b7damaging publicity about us;\n\uf0b7increased regulation;\n\uf0b7increased costs of doing business;\n\uf0b7reduction in demand for our products; and\n\uf0b7other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and/or undertake production operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nCompliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact production.\nThe laws and regulations of the United States, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea regulate our current business. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain permits for our development activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected or sensitive areas, or restrict the substances that can be released in connection with our operations. Our operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, natural resource damages, crude oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and the issuance of orders enjoining operations. In addition, we could be liable for environmental damages caused by, among others, previous property owners or operators of properties that we purchase or lease. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs. We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change and greenhouse gases and the use of hydraulic fracturing fluids, resulting in increased operating costs. In the United States for example, the Environmental Protection Agency continues to focus on requiring additional pollution controls on emissions from oil and gas production facilities. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThese laws and governmental regulations, which cover matters including drilling operations, taxation and environmental protection, may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions and could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the crude oil and natural gas industry in general. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to comply with such environmental laws and regulations without incurring substantial costs.\nWe have been, and in the future may become, involved in legal proceedings with governmental and private litigants, and, as a result, may incur substantial costs in connection with those proceedings.\nOur business subjects us to liability risks from litigation or government actions. We have been involved in legal proceedings, and from time to time we may in the future be a defendant or plaintiff in various lawsuits. The nature of our operations exposes us to further possible litigation claims in the future. There is risk that any matter in litigation could be decided unfavorably against us regardless of our belief, opinion, and position, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Litigation can be very costly, and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, net cash flows and financial condition. Adverse litigation decisions or rulings may also damage our business reputation.\nOften, our operations are conducted through joint ventures over which we may have limited influence and control. Private litigation or government proceedings brought against us could also result in significant delays in our operations.\nWe operate in countries and regions that are subject to legal and regulatory risk.\nInvestment in companies with assets in developing countries is generally only suitable for sophisticated investors who fully appreciate the significance of the risks involved in, and are familiar with, investing in developing countries. Investors should also note that developing countries could be subject to rapid change and that the information set out in this document may become outdated relatively quickly. Moreover, financial turmoil in developing countries tends to adversely affect prices in equity markets of other developing countries as investors move their money to more stable, developed markets.\nOur operations in Etame, Block P and any future opportunistic acquisitions of oil and natural gas reserves may require protracted negotiations with host governments, local governments and communities, local competent authorities, national oil companies and third parties and may be subject to economic, social and political considerations outside of our control, such as the risks of expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, forced interruption, suspension of operations, curtailment of sales, forced change or nullification of existing contracts or royalty rates, unenforceability of contractual rights, changing taxation policies or interpretations, adverse changes to laws (whether of general application or otherwise) or the interpretation or enforcement of laws, foreign exchange restrictions, inflation, changing political conditions, the death or incapacitation of political leaders, local currency devaluation, currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nWhile the laws of each of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea respectively recognize private and public property and the right to own property is protected by law, the laws of each country reserve, at the respective government\u2019s discretion, the right to expropriate property and terminate contracts (including the Etame PSC and the Block P PSC) for reasons of public interest, subject to reasonable compensation, determinable by the respective government in its discretion.\nThe respective applicable laws governing the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea (Law No. 002/2019 in Gabon and Law No. 8/2006 in Equatorial Guinea) each provide the respective government officials with significantly broad regulatory, inspective and auditing powers with respect to the performance of petroleum operations, which include the powers to negotiate, sign, amend and perform all contracts entered into between the respective governments and independent contractors. The\nexecutive branches of each respective government also retain significant discretionary powers, giving considerable control over the executive, judiciary and legislative branches of each government, and the ability to adopt measures with a direct impact on private investments and projects, including the right to appoint ministers responsible for petroleum operations. Further, in Equatorial Guinea, any new PSC or equivalent agreement for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons is subject to presidential ratification before it can become effective.\nAny of the factors detailed above or similar factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If disputes arise in connection with our operations in Gabon, Equatorial Guinea or any future jurisdiction in which we operate, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or foreign arbitration tribunals or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign ministries and national companies, to the legal jurisdiction of the United States.\nWhile we are not aware of any activities that would lead to the seizure of any assets, we cannot guarantee that there will not be regulations imposed on any individual or company that is related to our operations or our activities in the relevant region. Such measures, which would be beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and the price of our common stock.\nThe physical and regulatory impact of climate change could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to their effects.\nClimate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low-lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate-related damages to our facilities, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by climate effects or increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nIn addition, we expect continued and increasing regulatory attention to climate change issues and emissions of greenhouse gases, including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide (a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas combustion). For example, in April 2016, 195 nations, including Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and the United States, signed and officially entered into an international climate change accord (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). The Paris Agreement calls for signatory countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets, make these emissions targets more stringent over time and be transparent about the greenhouse gas emissions reporting and the measures each country will use to achieve its greenhouse gas targets. A long-term goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius from temperatures in the pre-industrial era. The Paris Agreement is effectively a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol treaty, an international treaty aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, to which various countries and regions are parties. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States\u2019 intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, with such withdrawal becoming effective in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued written notification to the United Nations of the United States\u2019 intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which took effect on February 19, 2021. On April 22, 2021, President Biden announced a target for the US to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It cannot be determined at this time what effect the Paris Agreement, and any related greenhouse gas emissions targets, potential prices on carbon emissions, regulations or other requirements, will have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This regulatory uncertainty, however, could result in a disruption to our business or operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks associated with climate change and potential regulatory programs meant to address climate change; these programs may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures or reduce demand for our product.\nClimate changes continues to be the focus of political and societal attention. Numerous proposals have been made and are likely to be forthcoming on the international, national, regional, state and local levels to reduce the emissions of GHG emissions. These efforts have included or may include cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting obligations and other regulatory programs that limit or require control of GHG\u2019s from certain sources. These programs may limit our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas, limit our ability to explore in new areas, or may make it more expensive to produce. In addition, these programs may reduce demand for our product either by incentivizing or mandating the use of other alternative energy sources, by prohibiting the use of our product, by requiring equipment using our product to shift to alternative energy sources, or by directly increasing the cost of fossil fuels to consumers.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock currently trades on the NYSE and the LSE, but an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:\n\uf0b7dilutive issuances of our common stock;\n\uf0b7announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;\n\uf0b7changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\uf0b7conditions generally affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry;\n\uf0b7the success of our operating strategy; and\n\uf0b7the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations. Financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the last several years that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of companies and that have, in many cases, been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Accordingly, the market price of the common stock may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. Also, certain institutional investors may base their investment decisions on consideration of our environmental, governance and social practices and performance against such institutions\u2019 respective investment guidelines and criteria, and failure to meet such criteria may result in a limited or no investment in our common stock by those institutions, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. There is no assurance that continuing fluctuations in the price and volume of publicly traded equity securities will not occur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely impacted, and the trading price of the common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock; however our ability to pay dividends in the future may be limited and no assurance can be given that we will be able to pay dividends to our stockholders in the future at current levels or at all.\nOn November 3, 2021, we announced that our board of directors adopted of a quarterly cash dividend policy of an expected $0.0325 per common share commencing in the first quarter of 2022. On January 28, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0325 per share of common stock, which is payable on March 18, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2022. To the extent we have adequate cash on hand and cash flows from operations, we will consider paying cash dividends in the future. Payment of future dividends, if any, and the establishment of future record and payment dates will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including current financial condition, the tax impact of repatriating cash, operating results and current and anticipated cash needs. As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders in the future or that the level of any future dividends will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nDual-listing on the NYSE and the LSE may lead to an inefficient market in the common stock.\nDual-listing of our common stock will result in differences in liquidity, settlement and clearing systems, trading currencies, prices and transaction costs between the exchanges where the common stock will be quoted. These and other factors may hinder the transferability of the common stock between the two exchanges.\nThe common stock is quoted on the NYSE and on the LSE. Consequently, the trading in and liquidity of the common stock is split between these two exchanges. The price of the common stock may fluctuate and may at any time be different on the NYSE and the LSE. Investors could seek to sell or buy common stock to take advantage of any price differences between the two markets through a practice referred to as arbitrage. Any arbitrage activity could create unexpected volatility in both common stock prices on either exchange and in the volumes of common stock available for trading on either market. This could adversely affect the trading of the common stock on these exchanges and increase their price volatility and/or adversely affect the price and liquidity of the common stock on these exchanges. In addition, holders of common stock in either jurisdiction will not be immediately able to transfer such shares for trading on the other market without effecting necessary procedures with our transfer agents/registrars. This could result in time delays and additional cost for stockholders.\nThe common stock is quoted and traded in USD on the NYSE. The common stock is quoted and traded in GBX on the LSE. The market price of the common stock on those exchanges may also differ due to exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not contain any rights of preemption in favor of existing stockholders, which means that stockholders may be diluted if additional common stock is issued.\nOur stockholders do not have preemptive rights and we, without stockholder consent, may issue additional common stock, preferred shares, warrants, rights, units and debt securities for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and repayment or refinancing of borrowings. We actively seek to expand our business through complementary or strategic acquisitions and may issue additional common stock in connection with those acquisitions. We also issue common stock to our executive officers, employees and independent directors as part of their compensation. This may have the effect of diluting the interests of existing stockholders. Additionally, to the extent that preemptive rights are granted, stockholders in certain jurisdictions may experience difficulties or may be unable to exercise their preemptive rights.\nThe choice of forum provisions in our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought in the name or right of the Company or on its behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, stockholder or other agent of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action arising or asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or any provision of the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCharter\u201d), or the Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, including, without limitation, any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Charter or the Bylaws. Nonetheless, pursuant to our Bylaws, the foregoing provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our Bylaws further provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Under the Securities Act, federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our Bylaws related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provisions in our Bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Additionally, the enforceability of choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If so, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSubstantial future sales of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, or additional offerings of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of common stock, or the availability of common stock for future sale, or the offer of additional common stock in the future, will have on the market price of common stock. Sales or an additional offering of substantial numbers of common stock in the public market, or the perception or any announcement that such sales or an additional offering could occur, could adversely affect the market price of common stock and may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their common stock at a time and price which they deem appropriate and could also impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities.\nAny issuance of preferred shares will rank in priority to our common stock.\nWhile we do not currently have any preferred shares outstanding, under our Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 500,000 preferred shares. Any issuance of preferred shares would rank in priority to our common shares with respect to payment of dividends, liquidation, and other matters.", "PERMNO": 78841, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EGY"}
