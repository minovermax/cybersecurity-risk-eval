You should carefully consider all information in this Form 10-K, including the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis section and the financial statements and related notes, prior to investing in our common stock. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to our Business:\n\u2022The prices of crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products materially affect our profitability, and are dependent upon many factors that are beyond our control.\n\u2022To successfully operate our facilities, we are required to expend significant amounts for capital outlays and operating expenditures. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic or any other widespread outbreak of an illness or pandemic or other public health crisis, and actions taken in response thereto, as well as certain developments in the global oil markets, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Competition in the refining and marketing industry and in our lubricants and specialty products segment is highly competitive, an increase in competition could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\n\u2022A disruption to or proration of the refined product distribution systems or manufacturing facilities we utilize could negatively impact our profitability.\n\u2022A material decrease in the supply of crude oil or other raw materials available to our refineries and other facilities could significantly reduce our production levels and negatively affect our operations.\n\u2022We depend upon HEP for a substantial portion of the crude supply and distribution network that serve our refineries, and we own a significant equity interest in HEP.\n\u2022Our acquisition strategy involves numerous risks, any of which could adversely affect us.\n\u2022An impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Potential product, service or other related liability claims and litigation could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\u2022We sell many of our lubricants and specialty products through distributors, which presents risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022Our hedging transactions may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n\u2022There are various risks associated with greenhouse gases and climate change, including increased regulation of CO2 emissions, that could result in increased operating costs and litigation and reduced demand for the refined products we produce and investment in our industry.\n\u2022The availability and cost of renewable identification numbers and other required credits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We are subject to significant regulation and oversight by governmental agencies. We incur significant costs, and expect to incur additional costs in the future, to comply with existing, new and changing environmental, energy, health and safety laws and regulations, and face potential exposure for environmental matters.\nTable of Content\n\u2022Our business is subject to complex and evolving global laws, regulations and security standards regarding privacy, cybersecurity and data protection, which could result in claims, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022Cyberattacks, data security breaches, information technology system failures, network disruptions, terrorist attacks or domestic vandalism, continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions and other disruptive risks for which we may not be adequately insured.\n\u2022We may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets.. Our credit facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may constrain our business and financing activities.\n\u2022Our business is subject to the risks of international operations, including currency fluctuations.\n\u2022We are exposed to the credit risks, and certain other risks, of our key customers and vendors.\n\u2022We may be unable to pay future dividends.\n\u2022We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise hurt our ability to compete in the market.\n\u2022Changes in our credit profile may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and limit our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refineries at desired capacity.\n\u2022Our business may suffer due to a departure of any of our key employees, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our workforce. A portion of our workforce is unionized, and any disruptions in our labor force or adverse employee relations could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and the value of a stockholder\u2019s investment could be impacted.\n\u2022Compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The headings provided in this Item 1A. are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not affect or limit the extent or interpretation of the risk factors.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe prices of crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products materially affect our profitability, and are dependent upon many factors that are beyond our control, including general market demand and economic conditions, seasonal and weather-related factors, regional and grade differentials and governmental regulations and policies.\nAmong these factors is the demand for crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products, which is largely driven by the conditions of local and worldwide economies, as well as by weather patterns, changes in consumer preferences and the taxation of these products relative to other energy sources. Governmental regulations and policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, and more recently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, also have a significant impact on our activities. Operating results can be affected by these industry factors, product and crude pipeline capacities, crude oil differentials (including regional and grade differentials), changes in transportation costs, accidents or interruptions in transportation, competition in the particular geographic areas that we serve, global market conditions, actions by foreign nations and factors that are specific to us, such as the success of particular marketing programs and the efficiency of our refinery operations. The demand for crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products can also be reduced due to a local or national recession or other adverse economic condition, which results in lower spending by businesses and consumers on gasoline and diesel fuel, higher gasoline prices due to higher crude oil prices, a shift by consumers to more fuel-efficient vehicles or alternative fuel vehicles (such as ethanol or wider adoption of gas/electric hybrid vehicles), or an increase in vehicle fuel economy, whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, legislation mandating or encouraging higher fuel economy or the use of alternative fuel.\nTable of Content\nWe do not produce crude oil and must purchase all our crude oil, the price of which fluctuates based upon worldwide and local market conditions. Our profitability depends largely on the spread between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil prices. This margin is continually changing and may fluctuate significantly from time to time. Crude oil and refined products are commodities whose price levels are determined by market forces beyond our control. For example, the reversal of certain existing pipelines or the construction of certain new pipelines transporting additional crude oil or refined products to markets that serve competing refineries could affect the market dynamic that has allowed us to take advantage of favorable pricing. A deterioration of crack spreads or price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, due to the seasonality of refined products markets and refinery maintenance schedules, results of operations for any particular quarter of a fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year and can vary year to year in the event of unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which we sell our petroleum products. In general, prices for refined products are influenced by the price of crude oil. Although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil may result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products, there may be a time lag in the realization of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on operating results, therefore, depends in part on how quickly refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes. A substantial or prolonged increase in crude oil prices without a corresponding increase in refined product prices, a substantial or prolonged decrease in refined product prices without a corresponding decrease in crude oil prices, or a substantial or prolonged decrease in demand for refined products could have a significant negative effect on our earnings and cash flow. Also, our crude oil and refined products inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market under the last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) inventory valuation methodology. If the market value of our inventory were to decline to an amount less than our LIFO cost, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash charge to cost of products sold even when there is no underlying economic impact at that point in time. Continued volatility in crude oil and refined products prices could result in lower of cost or market inventory charges in the future, or in reversals reducing cost of products sold in subsequent periods should prices recover. For example, we recorded a charge and increase to cost of products sold in the amount of $78.5 million and a non-cash decrease to cost of products sold in the amount of $119.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTo successfully operate our facilities, we are required to expend significant amounts for capital outlays and operating expenditures. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur facilities consist of many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. One or more of the units may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnaround for such units. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance could reduce our revenues during the period of time that the units are not operating. We have taken significant measures to expand and upgrade units in our facilities by installing new equipment and redesigning older equipment to improve refinery capacity or to address changes in consumer preferences, such as the growing demand for renewable diesel and other lower carbon fuels. The installation and redesign of key equipment at our facilities, including the conversion of our Cheyenne Refinery to renewable diesel production and the construction of the renewable diesel and pre-treatment units at our Artesia facility, involves significant uncertainties, including the following: our upgraded equipment may not perform at expected levels; operating costs of the upgraded equipment may be higher than expected; the yield and product quality of new equipment may differ from design and/or specifications and redesign, modification or replacement of the equipment may be required to correct equipment that does not perform as expected, which could require facility shutdowns until the equipment has been redesigned or modified. Any of these risks associated with new equipment, redesigned older equipment, or repaired equipment could lead to lower revenues or higher costs or otherwise have a negative impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. In the third quarter of 2020, we permanently ceased refining operations at our Cheyenne Refinery and subsequently began converting certain assets at the Cheyenne Refinery to renewable diesel production due, in part, to uncompetitive operating and maintenance costs for the refinery.\nOne of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new refinery processing units (or the purchase and refurbishment of used units from another refinery) and the conversion or expansion of existing ones, such as the conversion of the Cheyenne Refinery to renewable diesel production and the connection of a new renewable diesel and a pre-treatment unit at the Navajo Refinery. Projects are generally initiated to increase the yields of higher-value products, increase the amount of lower cost crude oils that can be processed, increase refinery production capacity, meet new governmental requirements or take advantage of new government incentive programs, or maintain the operations of our existing assets. Additionally, our growth strategy includes projects that permit access to new and/or more profitable markets, including the growing demand for renewable diesel and other lower carbon fuels. The construction process involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, most of which are not fully within our control, including:\nTable of Content\n\u2022third party challenges to, denials, or delays with respect to the issuance of requisite regulatory approvals and/or obtaining or renewing permits, licenses, registrations and other authorizations;\n\u2022societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition;\n\u2022compliance with or liability under environmental regulations;\n\u2022unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n\u2022disruptions in transportation of modular components and/or construction materials;\n\u2022severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorists or cyberattacks, domestic vandalism or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires, spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and/or\n\u2022nonperformance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors, or sub-contractors involved with a project.\nIf we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we make. In addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, the construction of our previously announced renewable diesel units and pre-treatment unit at our Cheyenne and Artesia facilities will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in demand for refined products or renewable diesel in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new capital investments may not achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we expect to execute turnarounds at our refineries, which involve numerous risks and uncertainties. These risks include delays and incurrence of additional and unforeseen costs. The turnarounds allow us to perform maintenance, upgrades, overhaul and repair of process equipment and materials, during which time all or a portion of the refinery will be under scheduled downtime.\nOur forecasted internal rates of return are also based upon our projections of future market fundamentals which are not within our control, including changes in general economic conditions, available alternative supply, global market conditions, actions by foreign nations and customer demand.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or any other widespread outbreak of an illness or pandemic or other public health crisis, and actions taken in response thereto, as well as certain developments in the global oil markets, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends on the demand for petroleum products such as transportation fuels and finished lubricant products, which is largely driven by the conditions of local and worldwide economies, and the supply of crude oil and other feedstocks. COVID-19\u2019s spread across the globe and governmental actions in response thereto have negatively affected worldwide economic and commercial activity, significantly reduced global demand for oil, gas and refined products, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets in the first half of 2020. Other factors currently impacting crude oil supply include production levels implemented by OPEC members, other large oil producers such as Russia and domestic and Canadian oil producers. The oversupply of crude oil in the market has caused certain domestic and Canadian oil producers from whom we source crude oil to shut-in their production, which could impact our ability to readily source crude oil once the stored crude oil is depleted. While demand for refined products stabilized in the second half of 2020, this combination of events contributed to an overall drop in prices, as well as a lack of forward visibility in demand, for crude oil and refined products in 2020. See \u201cItem 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business\u201d for additional discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.\nIn addition, the supply and demand for refined and finished lubricant products depends on many other factors outside of our control, some of which include:\n\u2022changes in domestic and international demand for, and the marketability of, our refined and finished lubricant products due to governmental actions, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, which could result in a full or partial shutdown of our facilities;\n\u2022increased price volatility, including the price we receive for refined and finished lubricant products;\n\u2022the health of our workforce, including contractors and subcontractors, and their access to our facilities, which could result in a full or partial shutdown of our facilities if a significant portion of the workforce at a facility is impacted;\nTable of Content\n\u2022the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines for COVID-19;\n\u2022the ability or willingness of our vendors and suppliers to provide the equipment, parts, crude oil or other raw materials for our operations or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations, which could reduce our production levels or otherwise cause our delay or failure to deliver refined or other finished lubricant products timely or at all or cause delay or failure to complete projects at our facilities;\n\u2022the ability or willingness of our customers to fulfill their contractual obligations or any material reduction in, or loss of, revenue from our customers;\n\u2022increased potential for the occurrence of operational hazards, including terrorism, cyberattacks or domestic vandalism, as well as information system failures or communication network disruptions;\n\u2022increased cost and reduced availability of capital for growth or capital expenditures;\n\u2022availability and operability of terminals, tankage and pipelines that store and transport crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products;\n\u2022delay by government authorities in issuing or maintaining permits necessary for our business or our capital projects;\n\u2022shareholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to limit sources of funding for the energy sector;\n\u2022increased costs of operation in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak, which costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance; and\n\u2022the impact of any economic downturn, recession or other disruption of the U.S. and global economies and financial and commodity markets.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to significantly modify our business practices (including limiting employee and contractor presence at our work locations, restricting travel unless approved by senior leadership, quarantining employees when necessary, reducing our expected total consolidated capital expenditures for 2020 and reducing utilization at our refineries), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers and communities. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be adversely impacted. In addition, deterioration in gross margins and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic was a contributing factor in certain goodwill and long-lived asset impairments we recorded in 2020. See \u201cAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations\u201d for further discussion of the impairment risk in our business and the impairments we recorded in 2020. A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in gross margins or a prolonged economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in an additional impairment of assets or of goodwill at some point in the future. Such impairment charges could be material.\nThe effects of COVID-19 are difficult to predict and the duration of any potential business disruption or the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results is uncertain. Any additional impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the spread, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or manage its impact, all of which are beyond our control. In addition, if the volatility and seasonality in the oil and gas industry were to increase, the demand for our products and the prices that we will be able to charge for those products may decline. We continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the volatility in global oil markets, while uncertain, have and may continue to, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nCompetition in the refining and marketing industry is intense, and an increase in competition in the markets in which we sell our products could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nWe compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies, including certain multinational oil companies. Because of their geographic diversity, larger and more complex refineries, integrated operations and greater resources, some of our competitors may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions, to obtain crude oil in times of shortage and to bear the economic risks inherent in all areas of the refining industry.\nWe are not engaged in petroleum exploration and production activities and do not produce any of the crude oil feedstocks used at our refineries. We do not have a retail business and therefore are dependent upon others for outlets for our refined products. Certain of our competitors, however, obtain a portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and have retail outlets. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets, with brand-name recognition, are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nTable of Content\nIn recent years there have been several refining and marketing consolidations or acquisitions between entities competing in our geographic market. These transactions could increase the future competitive pressures on us.\nThe markets in which we compete may be impacted by competitors' plans for expansion projects and refinery improvements that could increase the production of refined products in our areas of operation and significantly affect our profitability.\nAlso, the potential operation of new or expanded refined product transportation pipelines, or the conversion of existing pipelines into refined product transportation pipelines, could impact the supply of refined products to our existing markets and negatively affect our profitability.\nIn addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The more successful these alternatives become as a result of governmental regulations, technological advances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise, the greater the impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability. There are presently significant governmental and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative fuels in the United States.\nThe market for our lubricants and specialty products segment is highly competitive and requires us to continuously develop and introduce new products and product enhancements.\nOur ability to grow our Lubricants and Specialty Products segment depends, in part, on our ability to continuously develop, manufacture and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis, in response to customers\u2019 demands for higher performance process lubricants, coatings, greases and other product offerings. Our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer performance, features and lower prices that may render our products less competitive or obsolete, and, as a consequence, we may lose business and/or significant market share. Our efforts to respond to changes in consumer demand in a timely and cost-efficient manner to drive growth could be adversely affected by unfavorable margins or difficulties or delays in product development and service innovation, including the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products or service techniques. The development and commercialization of new products require significant expenditures over an extended period of time, and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable, and we could be required to write-off our investments related to a new product that does not reach commercial viability.\nA disruption to or proration of the refined product distribution systems or manufacturing facilities we utilize could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe utilize various common carrier or other third party pipeline systems to deliver our products to market. The key systems utilized by the El Dorado, Navajo, Woods Cross, and Tulsa Refineries are NuStar Energy and Magellan, SFPP and Plains, Chevron and UNEV, and Magellan, respectively.\nOur U.S. refineries also utilize systems owned by HEP. If these key pipelines or their associated tanks and terminals become inoperative or decrease the capacity available to us, we may not be able to sell our product, or we may be required to hold our product in inventory or supply products to our customers through an alternative pipeline or by rail or additional tanker trucks from the refinery, all of which could increase our costs and result in a decline in profitability.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in foreign countries that support the Lubricants and Specialty Products segment. If one of our facilities is damaged or disrupted, resulting in production being halted for an extended period, we may not be able to timely supply our customers. We take steps to mitigate this risk, including business continuity and contingency planning and procuring property insurance (including business interruption) and casualty insurance. Nevertheless, the loss of sales in any one region over an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTable of Content\nA material decrease in the supply of crude oil or other raw materials available to our refineries and other facilities could significantly reduce our production levels and negatively affect our operations.\nTo maintain or increase production levels at our refineries, we must continually contract for crude oil supplies from third parties. There are a limited number of crude oil suppliers in certain geographic regions, and in such cases, we may be required to source from a single third party supplier. If we are unable to maintain or extend our existing contracts with any such crude oil suppliers, or enter into new agreements on similar terms, the supply of crude oil could be adversely impacted, or we may incur a higher cost. A material decrease in crude oil production from the fields that supply our refineries, as a result of depressed commodity prices, lack of drilling activity, natural production declines, catastrophic events or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil available to our refineries. In addition, any prolonged disruption of a significant pipeline that is used in supplying crude oil to our refineries or the potential operation of a new, converted or expanded crude oil pipeline that transports crude oil to other markets could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil available to our refineries. Such an event could result in an overall decline in volumes of refined products processed at our refineries and therefore a corresponding reduction in our cash flow. In addition, the future growth of our operations will depend in part upon whether we can contract for additional supplies of crude oil at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in our currently connected supplies. If we are unable to secure additional crude oil supplies of sufficient quality or crude pipeline expansion to our refineries, we will be unable to take full advantage of current and future expansion of our refineries' production capacities.\nFor certain raw materials and utilities used by our refineries and other facilities, there are a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, we source from a single supplier and/or suppliers in economies that have experienced instability or the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located. Any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials, or increase the cost of such raw materials, which could significantly reduce our production levels or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain raw materials that we use are subject to various regulatory laws, and a change in the ability to legally use such raw materials may impact our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nIt is also common in the refining industry for a facility to have a sole, dedicated source for its utilities, such as steam, electricity, water and gas. Having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power, particularly in the case of rising raw material costs. Any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements.\nAdditionally, there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources. The decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth, drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations.\nIf our raw material, utility or water supplies were disrupted, our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime, which would have a direct negative impact on our operations.\nWe depend upon HEP for a substantial portion of the crude supply and distribution network that serve our refineries, and we own a significant equity interest in HEP.\nAt December 31, 2020, we owned a 57% limited partner interest and a non-economic general partner interest in HEP. HEP operates a system of crude oil and petroleum product pipelines, distribution terminals and refinery tankage in Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming and refinery units in Kansas and Utah. HEP generates revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through its pipelines, leasing certain pipeline capacity to third parties, charging fees for terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons and storing and providing other services at its terminals. HEP serves the El Dorado, Navajo, Woods Cross and Tulsa Refineries under several long-term pipeline and terminal, tankage and throughput agreements expiring in 2022 through 2036 serves the El Dorado Refinery under long-term tolling agreements expiring in 2030 and serves the Woods Cross Refinery under long-term tolling agreements expiring in 2031. Furthermore, our financial statements include the consolidated results of HEP. HEP is subject to its own operating and regulatory risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022its reliance on its significant customers, including us;\n\u2022competition from other pipelines;\n\u2022environmental regulations affecting pipeline operations;\n\u2022operational hazards and risks;\n\u2022pipeline tariff regulations affecting the rates HEP can charge;\n\u2022limitations on additional borrowings and other restrictions due to HEP's debt covenants; and\n\u2022other financial, operational and legal risks.\nTable of Content\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could directly or indirectly affect HEP's as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as HEP is a consolidated VIE. Additionally, these risks could affect HEP's ability to continue operations which could affect their ability to serve our supply and distribution network needs.\nWhile we own a 57% limited partner interest and a non-economic general partner interest in HEP, HEP is a publicly-traded master limited partnership and is a legally distinct entity. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and HEP, which may subject us to claims from HEP's public unitholders.\nFor additional information about HEP, see \u201cHolly Energy Partners, L.P.\u201d under Items 1 and 2, \u201cBusiness and Properties.\u201d For risks related to HEP's business, see Item 1A of HEP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur acquisition strategy involves numerous risks, any of which could adversely affect us.\nAn additional component of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire complementary assets or businesses for our refining operations in order to increase earnings and cash flow. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth, and other factors beyond our control. Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to:\n\u2022diversion of management time and attention from our existing business;\n\u2022challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of operations and inefficiencies that may result therefrom;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of an acquired business with those of our existing operations;\n\u2022liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance;\n\u2022greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results;\n\u2022difficulties or delays in achieving anticipated operational improvements or benefits or inaccurate assumptions about future synergies or revenues;\n\u2022incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets; and\n\u2022issuance of additional equity, which could result in further dilution of the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAny acquisitions that we do consummate may have adverse effects on our business and operating results.\nAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a goodwill or long-lived asset may be impaired. If a triggering event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value based on the ability to generate future cash flows. We may also conduct impairment testing based on both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Our goodwill and long-lived assets impairment analyses are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, estimates of future crack spreads, forecasted production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible a material impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any additional impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets in the future.\nTable of Content\nAs market prices for refined products and market prices for crude oil continue to fluctuate, we will need to continue to evaluate the carrying value of our refinery reporting units. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $232.2 million that related to our Cheyenne Refinery, $26.5 million for construction-in-progress consisting primarily of engineering work for potential upgrades to certain processing units at our Tulsa and El Dorado Refineries and $204.7 million related to PCLI. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $81.9 million that related to Sonneborn. A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in our operating results or overall economic conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill and / or additional long-lived asset impairments at some point in the future. Future impairment charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nPotential product, service or other related liability claims and litigation could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our operating responsibility on refined product pipelines is to insure the quality and purity of the products loaded at our loading racks. If our quality control measures were to fail, we may have contaminated or off-specification commingled pipelines and storage tanks or off-specification product could be sent to public gasoline stations. The development, manufacture and sale of specialty lubricant products also involves an inherent risk of exposure to potential product liability claims. These types of incidents could result in product liability claims from our customers. Our Lubricants and Specialty Products segment could also be subject to false advertising claims, product recalls, workplace exposure, product seizures and related adverse publicity.\nAny of these incidents is a significant commercial risk. Substantial damage awards have been made in certain jurisdictions against manufacturers and resellers based upon claims for injuries caused by the use of or exposure to various products. There can be no assurance that product liability claims against us would not have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations or our ability to maintain existing customers or retain new customers. Although we maintain product and other general liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the types or levels of coverage maintained are adequate to cover these potential risks, or that we will be able to continue to maintain existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all.\nWe sell many of our lubricants and specialty products through distributors, which presents risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nA large portion of our lubricants and specialty product sales, both in domestic and international markets, occur through distributors. As a result, we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell and support our products effectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. The sales, business practices and reputation of our distributors may affect our business and our reputation. The consolidation of distributors, loss of a relationship with a distributor, significant disagreement with a distributor, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of a distributor could also have an adverse effect on our operating results and may also result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction.\nOur hedging transactions may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nWe periodically enter into derivative transactions as it relates to inventory levels and/or future production to manage the risks from changes in the prices of crude oil, refined products and other feedstocks. These transactions limit our potential gains if commodity prices move above or below the certain price levels established by our hedging instruments. We hedge price risk on inventories above our target levels to minimize the impact these price fluctuations have on our earnings and cash flows. Consequently, our hedging results may fluctuate significantly from one reporting period to the next depending on commodity price fluctuations and our relative physical inventory positions. These transactions may also expose us to risks of financial losses; for example, if our production is less than we anticipated at the time we entered into a hedge agreement or if a counterparty to our hedge agreements fails to perform its obligations under the agreements.\nTable of Content\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION\nThere are various risks associated with greenhouse gases and climate change that could result in increased operating costs and litigation and reduced demand for the refined products we produce and investment in our industry.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other regions. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases, or \u201cGHGs\u201d, to restrict or eliminate such future emissions, and to require or incentivize the use of lower-carbon or renewable alternatives. As a result, our operations are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the refining of petroleum products and emission of GHGs.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. The U.S. Supreme Court has also found that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA. Accordingly, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas sources in the United States or to control or reduce emissions of GHGs, including methane, from such sources. In addition, the EPA, together with the DOT, implement GHG emission and corporate average fuel economy standards for vehicles manufactured in the United States. Moreover, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, restriction of emissions, electric vehicle mandates and combustion engine phaseouts. Similar such regulations exist at the provincial and federal levels in Canada, including a nation-wide greenhouse gas pricing initiative and regulations related to the control of GHGs from automobiles and light duty trucks and either cap and trade programs or carbon taxes in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta. The Netherlands also participates in certain European legal initiatives, including GHG cap and trade programs, and the Climate Act with the goal of significantly reducing GHG emissions by 49% (compared to 1990) by 2030 and by at least 95% (compared to 1990) by 2050. The Climate Act also establishes that the government must prepare a Climate Plan. The first Climate Plan covers the period between 2021 and 2030. This plan contains, amongst others, the principles by which the government intends to achieve the goals set out in the Climate Act. It is unclear what further measures the Dutch government will take to reduce GHG emissions pursuant to this law. At the international level, the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement\u201d calls for member nations to limit their GHG emissions through nationally-determined reduction goals reevaluated every five years after 2020. The United States initially joined and then withdrew from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020. Under the new administration, the United States rejoined the agreement effective February 19, 2021 and has instructed the federal government to begin formulating the United States' emissions reduction goal. EU member states have agreed to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030. The Netherlands target is 49% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the refined products that we produce. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in curtailed refinery activity, incurred liability, or other adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are also increasing risks of litigation related to climate change effects. Governments and third-parties have brought suit against some fossil fuel companies alleging, among other things, that such companies created public and private nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. While we are not party to such suits at this time, we may become subject to such litigation in the future. Such cases could also adversely impact public perception and the demand for fossil fuels and petroleum products, which could subsequently result in decreased demand for our services and refined products and a drop in our share price.\nTable of Content\nOur share price could be adversely impacted if existing shareholders, including institutional investors, elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into renewable energy or non-energy related sectors based on social and environmental considerations. Additionally, in recent years institutional lenders have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and have been lobbied intensively, and often publicly, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities, could result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects and could also adversely affect demand for our services and refined products, all of which could impact our future financial results.\nThe availability and cost of renewable identification numbers and other required credits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPursuant to the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the EPA promulgated the RFS regulations reflecting the increased volume of renewable fuels mandated to be blended into the nation's fuel supply. The regulations, in part, require refiners to add annually increasing amounts of \u201crenewable fuels\u201d to their petroleum products or purchase credits, known as RINs, in lieu of such blending. We currently purchase RINs for some fuel categories on the open market in order to comply with the quantity of renewable fuels we are required to blend under the RFS regulations. Since the EPA first began mandating biofuels in excess of the \u201cblend wall\u201d (the 10% ethanol limit prescribed by most automobile warranties), the price of RINs has been extremely volatile. While we cannot predict the future prices of RINs, the costs to obtain the necessary number of RINs could be material. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance with the RFS regulations on to our customers, if sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if we are otherwise unable to meet the RFS mandates, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the past, we have received small refinery exemptions under the RFS program for certain of our refineries. However, there is no assurance that such an exemption will be obtained for any of our refineries in future years. For example, the EPA has recently indicated it plans to more closely align the agency\u2019s criteria for granting small refinery exemptions with the recommendation of the Department of Energy, which could result in fewer such exemptions being granted. The failure to obtain such exemptions for certain of our refineries could result in the need to purchase more RINs than we currently have estimated and accrued for in our consolidated financial statements. EPA recently promulgated new RFS regulations that could require the agency to increase the volume of renewable fuel or RINs that refiners are required to purchase if the agency anticipates it will grant small refinery exemptions. This also could increase the number of RINs we need to purchase. Additionally, a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit vacated two small refinery exemption decisions for the 2016 compliance year and remanded the case to the EPA for further proceedings. That decision is before the Supreme Court for further review. It is not clear at this time what steps the EPA will take with respect to our 2016 small refinery exemptions, or how the case will impact future small refinery exemptions.\nIn addition, the RFS regulations are highly complex and evolving, requiring us to periodically update our compliance systems. The RFS regulations require the EPA to determine and publish the applicable annual volume and percentage standards for each compliance year by November 30 for the forthcoming year, and such blending percentages could be higher or lower than amounts estimated and accrued for in our consolidated financial statements. The future cost of RINs is difficult to estimate until such time as the EPA finalizes the applicable standards for the forthcoming compliance year, but the EPA does not always do so by the statutory deadline. Moreover, in addition to increased price volatility in the RINs market, there have been multiple instances of RINs fraud occurring in the marketplace over the past several years. The EPA has initiated several enforcement actions against refiners who purchase fraudulent RINs, resulting in substantial costs to the refiner. We cannot predict with certainty our exposure to increased RINs costs in the future, nor can we predict the extent by which costs associated with RFS regulations will impact our future results of operations.\nTable of Content\nWe incur significant costs, and expect to incur additional costs in the future, to comply with existing, new and changing environmental, energy, health and safety laws and regulations, and face potential exposure for environmental matters.\nOperations of our facilities and pipelines are subject to international, foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws regulating, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and distribution of petroleum and hazardous substances by pipeline, truck, rail, ship and barge, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. In addition, we have manufacturing and distribution operations in foreign countries that are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of such foreign countries. Permits or other authorizations are required under these laws for the operation of our facilities, pipelines and related operations, and these permits and authorizations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal or may require operational changes, which may involve significant costs. Furthermore, a violation of permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions, refinery shutdowns, and reputational harm. In addition, major modifications of our operations due to changes in the law could require changes to our existing permits or expensive upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards and, in 2018, published attainment/nonattainment designations. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Also, in February 2016, a new EPA rule became effective that amends three refinery standards already in effect, imposing additional or, in some cases, new emission control requirements on subject refineries. The final rule requires, among other things, benzene monitoring at the refinery fence line and submittal of fence line monitoring data to the EPA on a quarterly basis; upgraded storage tank controls requirements, including new applicability thresholds; enhanced performance requirements for flares, continuous monitoring of flares and pressure release devices and analysis and remedy of flare release events; and compliance with emissions standards for delayed coking units. In November 2018, the EPA published amendments to the new rules to clarify and correct certain requirements. These rules, as well as subsequent rulemaking under the CAA or similar laws, or new agency interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may necessitate additional expenditures in future years and result in increased costs on our operations. Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits will continue to have an impact on our operations, results of our operations and capital requirements.\nAs is the case with all companies engaged in industries similar to ours, we face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. The matters include, but are not limited to, soil, groundwater and waterway contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we processed, manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed.\nWe are and have been the subject of various local, state, provincial, federal, foreign, international and private proceedings relating to environmental regulations, conditions and inquiries. Current and future environmental regulations are expected to require additional expenditures, including expenditures for investigation and remediation, which may be significant, at our facilities. To the extent that future expenditures for these purposes are material and can be reasonably determined, these costs are disclosed and accrued.\nOur operations are also subject to various foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety, training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures. Failure to appropriately manage occupational health and safety risks associated with our business could also adversely impact our employees, communities, stakeholders, reputation and results of operations.\nThe costs of environmental and safety regulations are already significant and compliance with more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing regulations by government agencies or courts could have an adverse effect on the financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures for the installation and operation of systems and equipment that we do not currently possess.\nTable of Content\nWe are also subject to existing, and may in the future be subject to new or changing, domestic and foreign energy policy legislation. For example, in the United States, the Energy Independence and Security Act mandates annually increasing levels for the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol and increasing energy efficiency goals, among other steps. Dutch law also focuses on increasing the use of renewal fuels, and in Canada, fuel content legislation exists at the federal and provincial level. These statutory mandates may have the impact over time of offsetting projected increases in the demand for refined petroleum products in certain markets, particularly gasoline. In the near term, the new renewable fuel standard presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for both the ethanol and refining industries and may require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased ethanol use. Other legislative changes may similarly alter the expected demand and supply projections for refined petroleum products in ways that cannot be predicted.\nFor additional information on regulations and related liabilities or potential liabilities affecting our business, see \u201cRegulation\u201d under Items 1 and 2, \u201cBusiness and Properties,\u201d and Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nWe are subject to significant regulation and oversight by governmental agencies.\nNew laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations. Our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the new administration because it remains unclear specifically what the new administration may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. Regulation affects almost every part of our business. Furthermore, we could incur additional costs to comply with such statutes, rules, regulations and orders. Should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and orders of regulatory authorities, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. New laws, regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources. New laws or regulations, unexpected policy changes or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, applicable to our income, operations, assets or another aspect of our business, could have a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving global laws, regulations and security standards regarding privacy, cybersecurity and data protection (\u201cdata protection laws\u201d). Many of these laws are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nThe constantly evolving regulatory and legislative environment surrounding data privacy and protection poses increasingly complex compliance challenges, and complying with such data protection laws could increase the costs and complexity of compliance. While we do not collect significant amounts of personal information from consumers, we do have personal information from our employees, job applicants and some business partners, such as contractors and distributors. Any failure, whether real or perceived, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Our compliance with recently enacted laws like the General Data Protection Regulation, and other similar privacy/security laws, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions related to these laws, may increase our operating costs.\nTable of Content\nIncreases in required fuel economy and regulation of CO2 emissions from motor vehicles may reduce demand for transportation fuels.\nThe EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) are required to promulgate requirements regarding the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) of the nation's passenger fleet. On August 28, 2012, the EPA and NHTSA adopted standards through model year 2025 in two phases. The first phase established final standards for 2017-2021 model year vehicles that are projected to require 40.3 - 41.0 m.p.g. in model year 2021 on an average industry fleet-wide basis. The second phase of the CAFE program represents non-final \u201caugural\u201d standards for 2022-2025 model year vehicles that are projected to require 48.7 - 49.7 m.p.g. in model year 2025 on an average industry fleet-wide basis. However, following the change in presidential administrations, there have been attempts to modify these standards. In August 2018, the EPA and NHTSA proposed the Safer Affordable Fuel Economy Rule which amended the existing CAFE standards and proposed new standards covering model years through 2026. While the EPA issued a rule in September 2019 that seeks to preempt the ability of states to set stricter standards than those set by the federal government, no final rule has yet been issued regarding amendments to the current CAFE standards. All of these rulemakings will likely be subject to challenge by a variety of parties seeking stricter GHG and CAFE standards. Additionally, several states are seeking to promote zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, and to mandate transition away from internal combustion engines. Any increases in fuel economy standards, along with mandated increases in use of renewable fuels discussed above, as well as electric vehicle mandates or combustion engine bans, could result in decreasing demand for petroleum fuels. Decreasing demand for petroleum fuels could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nCyberattacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon information systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants and pipelines, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information is critical to our operations. We monitor our information systems on a 24/7 basis in an effort to detect cyberattacks or security breaches. Preventative and detective measures we utilize include independent cybersecurity audits and penetration tests. We implemented these efforts along with other risk mitigation procedures to detect and address unauthorized and damaging activity on our network, stay abreast of the increasing threat landscape and improve our security posture. Information technology system failures, communications network disruptions (whether intentional by a third party or due to natural disaster), and security breaches could still impact equipment and software used to control plants and pipelines, resulting in improper operation of our assets, potentially including delays in the delivery or availability of our customers\u2019 products, contamination or degradation of the products we transport, store or distribute, or releases of hydrocarbon products and other damage to our facilities for which we could be held liable.\nFurthermore, we collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personally identifiable information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. Despite our security measures, our information systems may become the target of cyberattacks or security breaches (including employee error, malfeasance or other breaches), which could result in the theft or loss of the stored information, misappropriation of assets, disruption of transactions and reporting functions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Even with insurance coverage, a claim could be denied or coverage delayed. A cyber-attack or security breach could result in liability under data privacy laws, regulatory penalties, damage to our reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in our products and services, or additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions and other disruptive risks for which we may not be adequately insured.\nOur operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards, unforeseen interruptions and other disruptive risks such as natural disasters, adverse weather, accidents, maritime disasters (including those involving marine vessels/terminals), fires, explosions, hazardous materials releases, terror or cyberattacks, domestic vandalism, power failures, mechanical failures and other events beyond our control. These events could result in an injury, loss of life, property damage or destruction, as well as a curtailment or an interruption in our operations and may affect our ability to meet marketing commitments.\nTable of Content\nWe may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at commercially reasonable rates and exclusions from coverage may limit our ability to recover the amount of the full loss in all situations. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.\nThere can be no assurance that insurance will cover all or any damages and losses resulting from these types of hazards. We are not fully insured against all risks to our business and therefore, we self-insure certain risks. If any of our facilities were to experience an interruption in operations, our earnings could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.\nThe energy industry is highly capital intensive, and the entire or partial loss of individual facilities can result in significant costs to both industry companies, such as us, and their insurance carriers. In recent years, several large energy industry claims have resulted in significant increases in the level of premium costs and deductible periods for participants in the energy industry. As a result of large energy industry claims, insurance companies that have historically participated in underwriting energy-related facilities may discontinue that practice or demand significantly higher premiums or deductible periods to cover these facilities. If significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur, or if other adverse conditions over which we have no control prevail in the insurance market, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at reasonable cost. In addition, we cannot assure you that our insurers will renew our insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. Further, our underwriters could have credit issues that affect their ability to pay claims. If a significant accident or event occurs that is self-insured or not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, communications network disruptions and data breaches.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of hardware and software systems and infrastructure, including our operating, communications and financial reporting systems. These systems are critical in meeting customer expectations, effectively tracking, maintaining and operating our equipment, directing and compensating our employees, and interfacing with our financial reporting system. We have implemented safeguards and other preventative measures to protect our systems and data, including sophisticated network security and internal control measures; however, our information technology systems and communications network, and those of our information technology and communication service providers, remain vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer malware, cyberattacks, data breaches and other events unforeseen or generally beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\nThe domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions are disrupted and volatile from time to time due to a variety of factors, including low consumer confidence, high unemployment, geoeconomic and geopolitical issues, weak economic conditions and uncertainty in the financial services sector. In addition, the fixed-income markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility, which negatively impacted market liquidity conditions. Recently, the equity and debt markets for many energy industry companies have been adversely affected by low oil prices. As a result, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially at times while the availability of funds from these markets diminished significantly. In particular, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of lending counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase as many lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduce, or in some cases cease to provide, funding to borrowers. In addition, lending counterparties under any existing revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations, or we may experience a decrease in our capacity to issue debt or obtain commercial credit or a deterioration in our credit profile, including a rating agency lowering or withdrawing of our credit ratings if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be required to sell assets. Moreover, without adequate funding, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, complete future acquisitions or construction projects, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, comply with regulatory requirements, or meet our short-term or long-term working capital requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements in a timely manner or meet our short-term or long-term working capital requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nTable of Content\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations, including currency fluctuations\nWe derive a portion of our revenue and earnings from international operations. Our acquisitions of Petro-Canada Lubricants and Sonneborn have expanded our operations and sales in foreign countries and correspondingly may increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the U.S. dollar could affect our revenue, competitiveness and cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, data privacy regulations and foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by any of our employees, contractors, distributors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our company's brand, international growth efforts and business.\nIn addition, global market risks, actions by foreign nations and other international conditions, particularly in a time of increasing economic and global instability, may have a material adverse effect on our results and operations. The consequences of such uncertainty cannot be anticipated or quantified.\nWe are exposed to the credit risks, and certain other risks, of our key customers and vendors.\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from contracts with key customers.\nIf any of our key customers default on their obligations to us, our financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. In addition, nonperformance by vendors who have committed to provide us with products or services could result in higher costs or interfere with our ability to successfully conduct our business.\nAny substantial increase in the nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers or vendors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks or domestic vandalism, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe long-term impacts of terrorist attacks and the threat of future terrorist attacks on the energy transportation industry in general, and on us in particular, are unknown. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks or domestic vandalism have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for refined products. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. Any one of, or a combination of, these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks and domestic vandalism could make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, vandalism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital including our ability to repay or refinance debt.\nWe may be unable to pay future dividends.\nWe will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand, cash from operations or borrowings under our credit agreement. The declaration of future dividends on our common stock is evaluated quarterly and will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, and restrictions in our debt agreements and legal requirements. We cannot assure you that any dividends will be paid or the frequency or amounts of such payments.\nTable of Content\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise hurt our ability to compete in the market.\nWe use intellectual property in the ordinary course of our business, including trademarks, trade secrets, copyrighted work and innovations, some of which is material to our business. We take measures to identify and protect our intellectual property through practices appropriate for securing and protecting exclusive rights in and to our intellectual property, including applying for registrations in the United States and in various foreign countries. Despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our trademarks (or other marks likely to cause confusion among our consumers), technologies, products and processes. In addition, the laws and/or judicial systems and enforcement mechanisms of foreign countries in which we create, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. We may also be subject to infringement complaints from others challenging our use of a technology. We cannot guarantee that our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use and appropriation, or our efforts to defend against third party claims of infringement would be successful. These potential risks to our intellectual property could subject us to increased competition and negatively impact our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in our credit profile, or a significant increase in the price of crude oil, may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and limit our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refineries at desired capacity.\nAn unfavorable credit profile, or a significant increase in the price of crude oil, could affect the way crude oil suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices with us or require credit enhancement. Due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases, any imposition by our suppliers of more burdensome payment terms or credit enhancement requirements on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers. This in turn could cause us to be unable to operate our refineries at desired capacity. A failure to operate our refineries at desired capacity could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.\nOur credit facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may constrain our business and financing activities.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our revolving credit facility imposes usual and customary requirements for this type of credit facility, including: (i) limitations on liens and indebtedness; (ii) a prohibition on changes in control and (iii) restrictions on engaging in mergers and consolidations. If we fail to satisfy the covenants set forth in the credit facility or another event of default occurs under the credit facility, the maturity of the loan could be accelerated or we could be prohibited from borrowing for our future working capital needs and issuing letters of credit. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these immediate payments. If we desire to undertake a transaction that is prohibited by the covenants in our credit facility, we will need to obtain consent under our credit facility. Such refinancing may not be possible or may not be available on commercially acceptable terms.\nOur business may suffer due to a departure of any of our key senior executives or other key employees. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity.\nOur future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and key technical personnel. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance, non-compete agreements, or employment agreements with respect to any member of our senior management team. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key technical employee could significantly harm us. We face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our customers and other companies operating in our industry. To the extent that the services of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel would be unavailable to us for any reason, we may be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our company. We may not be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms, or at all.\nFurthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced laborers with proficiency in multiple tasks. A shortage of trained workers due to retirements or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our operations.\nTable of Content\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and any disruptions in our labor force or adverse employee relations could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on unionized labor for the operation of many of our facilities. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 29% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements with various expiration dates. In addition, employees who are not currently represented by labor unions may seek union representation in the future. We may not be able to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements when they expire on satisfactory terms or at all. If we are unable to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements when they expire, any work stoppages or other labor disturbances at these facilities could have an adverse effect on our business, impact our ability to make distributions to our unitholders and payments of our debt obligations, and increase our costs. In addition, our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage or other adverse employee relations event at any of our facilities in the future, and any work stoppage could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and the value of a stockholder\u2019s investment could be impacted.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022general economic, industry global and stock market conditions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;\n\u2022sales of common stock by us, our senior officers or our affiliates; and/or\n\u2022the other factors described in these Risk Factors.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties.", "PERMNO": 32803, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "HFC"}
