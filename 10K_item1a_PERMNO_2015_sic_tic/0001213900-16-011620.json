{"cik": "1528356", "company": "Genie Energy Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document, particularly the discussions about regulation, competition and intellectual property. The trading price of our Class B common stock and Series 2012-A Preferred Stock could decline due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Genie Retail Energy\nThe REP business is highly competitive, and we may be forced to cut prices or incur additional costs.\nGRE\u2019s REP businesses face substantial competition both from the traditional incumbent utilities as well as from other REPs, including REP affiliates of the incumbent utilities in specific territories. As a result, we may be forced to reduce prices, incur increased costs or lose market share and cannot always pass along increases in commodity costs to customers. We compete on the basis of provision of services, customer service and price. Present or future competitors may have greater financial, technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage. Additionally, our experience has shown that utilities don\u2019t change their sell rates offered to customers immediately in response to increased prices for the underlying commodities. There is a time lag before utilities increase prices to reflect their increased costs and market prices for commodities.\nREPs like IDT Energy that offer variable rate products, and reflect real-time commodity costs, may offer variable rates prices which are not competitive with other fixed rate providers.\nConversely, in a downward moving commodity cost environment, variable rate REPs like IDT Energy may benefit from the lag that utilities experience in reducing their sell rate to reflect the lower cost base in the commodity markets, and may reflect commodity costs decreases in their offerings and rates.\nIncreasing our market share depends in part on our ability to persuade more customers to switch to GRE\u2019s services than those that churn from us to other providers or back to the local utility. Moreover, local utilities and some REPs may have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to GRE\u2019s REPs requires significant marketing and sales operations. If GRE is not successful in convincing customers to switch, our REP businesses, results of operations and financial condition will all be adversely affected.\nOur current strategy is based on current regulatory conditions and assumptions, which could change or prove to be incorrect.\nRegulation over the electricity and natural gas markets has been in flux at the state and federal levels. In particular, any changes adopted by the FERC, or changes in state or federal laws or regulations (including greenhouse gas laws) may affect the prices at which GRE purchases electricity or natural gas for its customers. While we endeavor to pass along increases in energy costs to our customers pursuant to our variable rate customer offerings, we may not always be able to do so due to competitive market forces and the risk of losing our customer base.\nOn February 23, 2016, the New York PSC issued an order that sought to impose significant new restrictions on REPs operating in New York, including GRE. The restrictions described in the PSC\u2019s order, which were to become effective March 4, 2016, would require that all REPs\u2019 electricity and natural gas offerings to residential and small business customers include an annual guarantee of savings compared to the price charged by the relevant incumbent utility or, for electricity offerings, provide at least 30% of the supply from renewable sources. Customers not enrolled in a compliant program would be relinquished back to the local utility at the end of their contract period or, for variable price customers operating on month to month agreements, at the end of the current monthly billing cycle.\nOn March 4, 2016, a group of parties from the REP industry sought and won a temporary restraining order to stay implementation of the most restrictive portions of the PSC\u2019s order until a court hearing on April 14, 2016. GRE expects that the REP industry will take additional legal action in response to the order seeking a definitive judicial review of the industry\u2019s challenges to the PSC\u2019s order.\nWe are evaluating the potential impact of the PSC\u2019s order on our New York operations, while preparing to operate in compliance with any new requirements. Depending on the final language of the order and the outcome of legal appeals, as well as our final response to the order with respect to our relationships with our New York customers, the order will likely have a substantial impact upon GRE\u2019s operations in New York. As of December 31, 2015, New York represented 53% of GRE\u2019s total meters served and 44% of the total RCEs of GRE\u2019s customer base.\nIn connection with the events described in the Risk Factor below entitled \u201cUnusual weather conditions may have significant direct and indirect impacts on GRE\u2019s business and results of operations\u201d, IDT Energy responded to formal and informal information requests from state utility commissions, state attorneys general, and state legislators related to the wholesale and retail electricity price increases in the winter of 2014. In addition, the Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Acting Consumer Advocate filed a Joint Complaint against IDT Energy with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in connection with such events. Legislators and regulators may enact or modify laws or regulation to prevent the repetition of the price spikes discussed below or address customer complaints that have come to light in connection with those events. Potential regulatory and/or legislative changes may impact our ability to use our established sales and marketing channels. Any changes in these factors, or any significant changes in industry development, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and growth or threaten the viability of our current business model.\nFixed Rate Products or Guaranteed Pricing Programs could result in losses or decreased profits if GRE fails to estimate commodity prices accurately.\nREPs and utilities offering fixed rate products or guaranteed pricing often are unable to change their sell rates offered to customers in response to volatility in the prices of the underlying commodities. In times of high commodity prices, these fixed rate programs expose us to the risk that we will incur significant unforeseen costs in performing the contracts.\nHowever, it is difficult to predict future commodity costs. Any shortfalls resulting from the risks associated with fixed-price programs will reduce our working capital and profitability. Our inability to accurately estimate the cost of providing services under these programs could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows.\nGRE\u2019s growth depends on its ability to enter new markets.\nNew markets for our business are determined based on many factors, which include the regulatory environment, as well as GRE\u2019s REP businesses ability to procure energy in an efficient and transparent manner. We seek to purchase wholesale energy where there is a real time market that reflects a fair price for the commodity for all participants. Once new markets are determined to be suitable for GRE\u2019s REP businesses, we will expend substantial efforts to obtain necessary licenses and will incur significant customer acquisition costs and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in new markets. Furthermore, there are regulatory differences between the markets that we currently operate in and new markets, including, but not limited to, exposure to credit risk, additional churn caused by tariff requirements, rate-setting requirements and incremental billing costs. A failure to identify, become licensed in, and enter new territories may have a material negative impact on our growth, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfair business practices or other activities of REPs may adversely affect us.\nCompetitors in the highly competitive REP market have engaged in unfair business practices to sign up new customers. Competitors engaging in unfair business practices create an unfavorable impression about our industry on consumers, regulators or political bodies. Such unfair practices by other companies can adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our customer base. The successes, failures or other activities of various REPs within the markets that we serve may impact how we are perceived in the market. Further, such practices can lead to regulatory action, such as the recent New York PSC Order, that can negatively impact us and the industry.\nDemand for REP services and consumption by customers are significantly related to weather conditions.\nTypically, colder winters and hotter summers create higher demand and consumption for natural gas and electricity, respectively. Milder than normal winters and/or summers may reduce the demand for our energy services, thus negatively impacting our financial results.\nUnusual weather conditions may have significant direct and indirect impacts on GRE\u2019s business and results of operations.\nA confluence of issues in January and February 2014 associated with the 2013-2014 winter season\u2019s polar vortex resulted in extraordinarily large spikes in the prices of wholesale electricity and natural gas in markets where GRE and other retail providers purchase their supply. In some regions, wholesale prices increased briefly by factors of more than eight times. Because of dramatic increases in wholesale electricity costs, the retail electricity prices that GRE\u2019s REPs and many other variable rate electricity suppliers charged to their customers increased sharply in January and February 2014. The unusually cold weather and resultant high energy costs also adversely affected GRE\u2019s customer churn and customer acquisition efforts. GRE responded by reducing its target margins in order to mitigate the severity of the commodity price increases on its customers and issued rebates to hard hit customers.\nRepeats of the circumstances described above or similar circumstances could similarly harm margins and profitability in the future, and we could find it necessary to take similar or other actions that would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our variable pricing plan resulted in increased prices charged to customers, we experienced an increase in customer churn as utilities and fixed price REPs appeared to have more attractive pricing, although those increased churn levels have peaked. A failure to mitigate an increase in churn could result in decreases in meters served and revenues.\nGRE has a twelve-month guaranteed rate residential offering in some utility territories, and a new brand, Residents Energy, to focus on marketing and sales of guaranteed rate offerings. We will face greater commodity risk from guaranteed rate offerings, some of which we may not be able to effectively hedge.\nThe retail electricity price increases discussed above resulted in large numbers of customers filing informal and formal complaints to state utility commissions, state attorneys general and state legislators. IDT Energy was served with several thousand formal and informal customer complaints to state utility commission and state attorneys general related to the winter retail price increases. IDT Energy has responded to each customer complaint it has received and attempted to resolve each complaining customer\u2019s concerns. GRE\u2019s REPs also paid approximately $5 million in rebates to affected customers in the year ended December 31, 2014. IDT Energy was not under any obligation to provide such rebates and did so in order to mitigate the impact of the price increases on its customers notwithstanding that the underlying cause of the price increase was beyond GRE\u2019s control.\nIf certain REPs, however, are determined to have acted in a manner that was harmful to customers, the entire industry can suffer due to the reputational harm.\nGRE is subject to litigation that may limit its operations.\nIn connection with the events described in the Risk Factor above entitled \u201cUnusual weather conditions may have significant direct and indirect impacts on GRE\u2019s business and results of operations\u201d, IDT Energy has also been sued in separate putative class action suits in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, partially related to the price increases during the winter of 2014. These matters are more fully discussed below in Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report.\nIDT Energy does not believe that it was at fault or acted in any way improperly with respect to the events of winter 2014. However, we cannot predict the outcome of putative class action litigation or the impact on us of these or other actions, or whether there will be other impacts from the conditions that existed in winter 2014. Further, although we have taken action to insulate us and our customers from future similar events, we cannot assure that those actions will be effective and we will not be subject to class actions in the future.\nSuch class action lawsuits or other claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, competitive position or results of operations.\nRegulatory conditions can affect the amount of taxes and fees we need to pay and our pricing advantages.\nWe are subject to audits in various jurisdictions for various taxes, including income tax, utility excise tax and sales and use tax. Aggressive stances taken recently by regulators increase the likelihood of our having to pay additional taxes and fees in connection with these audits. In the future, we may seek to pass such charges along to our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our pricing advantages.\nCommodity price volatility could have an adverse effect on our direct cost of revenues and our results of operations.\nVolatility in the markets for certain commodities can have an adverse impact on our costs for the purchase of the electricity and natural gas that GRE sells to its customers. In our fixed or guaranteed price products, we cannot, and in our variable price products, due to customer or competitive factors, we may not always be able or choose to, pass along increases in costs to our customers. This would have an adverse impact on our margins and results of operations. Alternatively, volatility in pricing for GRE\u2019s electricity and natural gas related to the cost of the underlying commodities can lead to increased customer churn. In times of high commodity costs, our variable pricing model and commodity purchasing approach can lead to competitive disadvantages as we must pass along all or some portion of our increased costs to our customers.\nWe face risks that are beyond our control due to our reliance on third parties and our general reliance on the electrical power and transmission infrastructure within the United States.\nOur ability to provide energy delivery and commodity services depends on the operations and facilities of third parties, including, among others, BP, NYISO and PJM. Our reliance on the electrical power generation and transmission infrastructure within the United States makes us vulnerable to large-scale power blackouts. The loss of use or destruction of third party facilities that are used to generate or transmit electricity due to extreme weather conditions, breakdowns, war, acts of terrorism or other occurrences could greatly reduce our potential earnings and cash flows.\nThe REP business, including our relationship with our suppliers, is dependent on access to capital and liquidity.\nOur business involves entering into contracts to purchase large quantities of electricity and natural gas. Because of seasonal fluctuations, we are generally required to purchase electricity or natural gas in advance and finance that purchase until we can recover such amounts from revenues. GRE has a Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP pursuant to which we purchase electricity and natural gas at market rate plus a fee. The agreement was modified and extended on November 19, 2015, and is scheduled to terminate on November 30, 2019. In addition to other advantages of this agreement, we are only required to post security with BP. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the required covenants, that BP will be able to maintain their required credit rating, or that the agreement will be renewed upon its expiration. In addition, the security requirements outside of the BP agreement may increase as we enter other markets. Difficulty in obtaining adequate credit and liquidity on commercially reasonable terms may adversely affect our business, prospects and financial conditions.\nA revision to certain utility best practices and programs in which we participate and with which we comply could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results and operations.\nCertain retail access \u201cbest practices\u201d and programs proposed and/or required by state regulators have been implemented by utilities in most of the service territories in which we operate. One such practice is participation in purchase of receivables, or POR, programs under which certain utilities purchase customer receivables for approximately 98% of their face value in exchange for a first priority lien in the customer receivables without recourse against a REP. This program is a key to our control of bad debt risk in our REP business in New York and a similar program is important to us in Pennsylvania.\nIn New Jersey, customers who are delinquent in paying their invoices are no longer eligible to receive a consolidated utility invoice. A consolidated utility invoice is similar to a purchase of receivables program since the utility has the responsibility to bill the customer and collect the receivable. Instead, those customers are switched to a dual bill arrangement, whereby GRE\u2019s REP businesses are responsible to bill and collect the commodity portion of the customers\u2019 invoices. Once we invoice these customers under a dual bill arrangement, we have bad debt risk associated with that portion of our revenues. Economic conditions, the creditworthiness of our customers in New Jersey and our ability to collect from these customers, among other things, may impact our profitability.\nThe REP business depends on maintaining the licenses in the states we operate and any loss of those licenses would adversely affect our business, prospects and financial conditions.\nGRE\u2019s REP businesses require licenses from public utility commissions and other regulatory organizations to operate its business. Those agencies may impose various requirements to obtain or maintain licenses. Further, certain non-governmental organizations have been focusing on the REP industry and the treatment of customers by certain REPs. Any negative publicity regarding the REP industry in general and GRE in particular or any increase in customer complaints regarding GRE\u2019s REP businesses could negatively affect our relationship with the various commissions and regulatory agencies and could negatively impact our ability to obtain new licenses to expand operations or maintain the licenses currently held. In the aftermath of the polar vortex, several regulatory bodies adopted more aggressive policies toward REPs, including the action against IDT Energy in Pennsylvania described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Any loss of our REP licenses would cause a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe REP business depends on the continuing efforts of our management team and our personnel with strong industry or operational knowledge and our efforts may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur success depends on key members of our management team, the loss of whom could disrupt our business operation. Our business also requires a capable, well-trained workforce to operate effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our qualified personnel, the loss of whom may adversely affect our business, prospects and financial conditions.\nWe could be harmed by network disruptions, security breaches, or other significant disruptions or failures of our IT infrastructure and related systems.\nTo be successful, we need to continue to have available a high capacity, reliable and secure network. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber-attack, malware, computer viruses, sabotage, or other significant disruption of our IT infrastructure and related systems. We face a risk of a security breach or disruption from unauthorized access to our proprietary or classified information on our systems. Certain of our personnel operate in jurisdictions that could be a target for cyber-attacks. The secure maintenance and transmission of our information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit our information, or those of service providers or business partners, may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our consent.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions. We may be unable to anticipate all potential types of attacks or intrusions or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures.\nNetwork disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described systems could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems, and therefore, our operations; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of our proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; (iii) require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the damages that result or to change our systems; or (iv) result in a loss of business, damage our reputation or expose us to litigation. Any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our acquiring complementary businesses and assets and expanding our existing operations, which we may be unable to do.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on our ability to acquire businesses and assets that are complementary to our existing operations. We may also seek to acquire other businesses. The success of this acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to accomplish the following:\n\u2022 identify suitable businesses or assets to buy;\n\u2022 complete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022 complete the acquisition in the time frame we expect;\n\u2022 improve the results of operations of the businesses that we buy and successfully integrate their operations into our own; and\n\u2022 avoid or overcome any concerns expressed by regulators, including antitrust concerns.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing any or all of these steps. Our failure to implement our acquisition strategy could have an adverse effect on other aspects of our business strategy and our business in general. We may not be able to find appropriate acquisition candidates, acquire those candidates that we find or integrate acquired businesses effectively or profitably.\nRisks Related to Genie Oil and Gas\nWe have no current production of oil and gas and we may never have any.\nWe do not have any current production of oil and gas. We cannot assure you that we will produce or market shale oil or gas at all or in commercially profitable quantities. Our ability to produce and market oil and gas may depend upon our ability to develop and operate our planned projects and facilities, which may be affected by events or conditions that impact the advancement, operation, cost or results of such projects or facilities, including:\n\u2022 Energy commodity prices relative to production costs;\n\u2022 The occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties;\n\u2022 The outcome of negotiations with potential partners, governmental agencies, regulatory bodies, suppliers, customers or others;\n\u2022 Changes to existing legislation or regulation governing our current or planned operations;\n\u2022 Our ability to obtain all the necessary permits to operate our facilities;\n\u2022 Changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third-party equipment or services such as drilling and processing and access to power sources; and\n\u2022 Security concerns or acts of terrorism that threaten or disrupt the safe operation of our facilities.\nIn-situ technology for the extraction of oil and gas from oil shale is in its early stages of development and has not been deployed commercially at large scale. AMSO, LLC, Genie Mongolia and IEI may not be able to develop environmentally acceptable and economically viable technology in connection therewith.\nCertain of our projects are predicated on the production and extraction of oil and gas from unconventional resources, defined as any resource other than the traditional oil well. Our initial activity is in the in-situ production of oil and gas from oil shale, which is typically more costly and is less established technically than traditional oil and gas production and therefore, incurs a higher degree of technology risk. The greater cost increases the risk that we will not be profitable given commodity price fluctuations, assuming we enter into commercial production.\nOperating hazards and uninsured risks with respect to the oil and gas operations may have material adverse effects on our operations.\nOur research, exploration and, if successful, development and production operations are subject to risks similar to those normally incident to the exploration for and the development and production of oil and gas, including blowouts, subsidence, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and other environmental and operating risks. These hazards could result in substantial losses due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. While as a matter of practice we have insurance against some or all of these risks, such insurance may not cover the particular hazard and may not be sufficient to cover all losses. The occurrence of a significant event adversely affecting any of our operations could have a material adverse effect on us, could materially affect our continued operations and could expose us to material liability.\nGenie Oil and Gas\u2019 dependence on contractors, equipment and professional services that have limited availability could result in increased costs and possibly material delays in their respective work schedules.\nDue to the lack of available technical resources with in-situ hydrocarbon production experience, the costs for our operations may be more expensive than planned or there could be delays in our operating plans. We are also more likely to incur delays in our drilling and operating schedule and we may not be able to meet our required work schedule. Similarly, some of the professional personnel we need for our planned operations are not available in the locations in which we operate or are not available on short notice for work in such location, and, therefore, we may need to use non-local contractors for various projects. Any or all of the factors specified above may result in increased costs and delays in our work schedule.\nGenie Oil and Gas will require substantial funds and will need to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe will need substantial funds to fully execute our research and development activities, and, if those activities are successful, we will need additional substantial funds to commence our anticipated commercial operations, if any. Failure to secure adequate funding could adversely affect our ability to advance our strategic plans as currently contemplated and require us to delay, scale back, or shut down our operations.\nOn February 25, 2016, Total informed AMSO of its decision not to continue funding AMSO, LLC. As a result, we will need to find other sources of funding or otherwise risk shutting down AMSO, LLC\u2019s operations.\nGenie Oil and Gas\u2019 success depends on the continuing efforts of key personnel and certain strategic partners, and our efforts may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel, particularly those with expertise in the oil and gas industry and with in-situ hydrocarbon projects. There is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our qualified technical personnel. Specifically, we heavily rely on the services of Harold Vinegar, Ph.D. at GOGAS, for his technical expertise, assistance in the development of our intellectual property and guidance on building out a pilot/commercial facility for potential commercial production. Specifically, Dr. Vinegar has a long-term employment agreement with us through 2017. In addition, AMSO, LLC was dependent on Total (as discussed more fully in Item 1 to Part I of this Annual Report) for technical expertise, financial support and guidance.\nThe unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these people and/or the technical expertise and support of certain partners, and the ability to find suitable replacements within a reasonable period of time thereafter, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThere are uncertainties associated with AMSO, LLC\u2019s lease, Afek licenses and Genie Mongolia\u2019s agreements.\nThe RD&D Lease awarded by the BLM to EGL Resources and acquired by AMSO, LLC covers an area of 160 acres. The lease had an initial ten-year term beginning on January 1, 2007 and provides for a five-year extension if AMSO can demonstrate that a process leading to the production of commercial quantities of shale oil is diligently being pursued. In November 2015, AMSO satisfied the extension criteria, and the RD&D Lease was extended effective on January 1, 2017. The terms of the RD&D Lease do not guarantee that the BLM will grant a commercial lease. Further, there is significant environmental opposition to the commercial production of shale oil. Under current regulation, there are numerous conditions and requirements, the evaluation of which is subject to considerable discretion by the BLM, that AMSO, LLC will have to satisfy in order to convert its RD&D Lease into a commercial lease prior to the expiration of the RD&D Lease term. These conditions, which are more fully discussed in Item 1to Part I of this Annual Report, require AMSO, LLC to demonstrate, among other things, an economically viable commercial production process which will likely depend upon the prices of competing products, including conventional oil. There can be no assurance that AMSO, LLC will satisfy all of these conditions and requirements. Additionally, there have been proposed changes to the regulations governing commercial leases such as the lease into which AMSO, LLC intends to convert its RD&D Lease. The BLM indicated that it intends to issue new commercial oil shale regulations, which could affect the commercial royalty rates and the conversion criteria. Although the conversion terms of AMSO, LLC\u2019s RD&D Lease provide for applicability of the existing regulatory scheme, we cannot assure you that we will not be subjected to more restrictive or less favorable regulations.\nIEI had an exclusive Shale Oil Exploration and Production License that covers approximately 238 square kilometers in the south of the Shfela region in Israel. The license expired in July 2015. Although IEI may apply for a new license, there is no guarantee that a new license would be granted or that the license will not be successfully challenged by environmental or other opposition groups.\nIn April 2013, the Government of Israel finalized the award to Afek of an exclusive three year petroleum exploration license covering 396.5 square kilometers in the southern portion of the Golan Heights. Because of the dispute as to the status of the Golan Heights, operations under the license may initiate international criticism, sanctions and\nboycotts. The political uncertainties surrounding the Golan Heights may result in (i) questions regarding the validity of the license granted to Afek by the State of Israel,; (ii) disputed titles to any resources extracted; (iii) possible sanctions on Afek or us or restrictions on sale of any extracted resources; and (iv) possible negative publicity or other adverse public activities or perceptions of Afek and us. In addition, if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria by Israel, the continuation of Afek\u2019s license would be in doubt.\nIn February 2016, Israel\u2019s Northern District Planning and Building Committee approved a two-year permit extension for Afek to continue to conduct its up to ten-well oil and gas exploration program. The original permit was for a one-year period, which commenced in February 2015. This extension is expected to cover the remainder of Afek\u2019s ongoing exploratory program in the southern portion of the area covered by it exploratory license issued by Israel\u2019s National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Ministry. The original oil and gas exploration license term expires in April 2016, and Afek is required to file an application to extend the term with the Ministry of National Infrastructure Energy and Water. We believe the extension will be granted.\nIn April 2013, Genie Mongolia and the Petroleum Authority of Mongolia entered into an exclusive oil shale development agreement to explore and evaluate the commercial potential of oil shale resources in a 34,470 square kilometer area in Central Mongolia.\nIn September 2014, Genie Mongolia signed a prospecting agreement with the Petroleum Authority of Mongolia covering an additional 25,000 square kilometers in Central Mongolia. In light of the progress achieved by Afek in Northern Israel, we suspended our operations in Mongolia.\nGenie Oil and Gas is subject to regulatory, legal and political risks that may limit its operations.\nOur operations and potential earnings may be affected from time to time in varying degree by regulatory, legal and political factors, including laws and regulations related to environmental or energy security matters, including those addressing alternative and renewable energy sources and the risks of global climate change and legal challenges. Such laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:\n\u2022 The discharge of pollutants into the environment;\n\u2022 The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes;\n\u2022 The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives;\n\u2022 Restrictions on exploration and production;\n\u2022 Loss of petroleum rights, including key leases, licenses or permits;\n\u2022 Tax or royalty increases, including retroactive claims;\n\u2022 Intellectual property challenges that would limit our ability to use our planned in-situ production technologies; and\n\u2022 Political instability, war or other conflicts in areas where we operate.\nFor example, in March 2011, the Israeli Parliament passed a bill materially increasing the overall taxes, royalties and other fees due to the Israeli government from revenues derived by oil and natural gas producers. The Israeli Income Tax Ordinance was revised accordingly and the amount payable to the government from revenues derived by oil and natural gas producers increased from a maximum of 32% to 52%. This tax will only be imposed once a project has passed certain milestones set forth in the ordinance (when the profits derived from a certain field have reached 150% of the original investment in that field).\nEmerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including significant legal, economic and political risks.\nMongolia does not possess as sophisticated and efficient business, regulatory, power and transportation infrastructures as generally exist in more developed market economies. Particularly, the legal system of Mongolia is less developed than those of more established jurisdictions, which may result in risks such as: the lack of effective legal redress in the courts; a higher degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities; delays caused by the extensive bureaucracy; the lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable laws and regulations; inconsistencies or conflicts between and within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and resolutions; and relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters. As a result, there may be ambiguities, inconsistencies and anomalies in the agreements, licenses and title documents through which Genie Mongolia holds its interests in Mongolia, or the underlying legislation upon which those interests are based. Many laws have been enacted, but in many instances they are neither understood nor enforced and may be applied in an inconsistent, arbitrary or unfair manner.\nAMSO, LLC\u2019s RD&D Lease is subject to other third party lease interests.\nThere are other mineral leases which are collocated with AMSO, LLC\u2019s lease interests, including the territory designated for AMSO, LLC\u2019s commercial lease conversion. While some of these other leases are subject to special oil shale stipulations requiring the leaseholders to minimize potential impacts and prevent interference with oil shale development, others are not. Although AMSO, LLC works to coordinate drilling plans and operations with these collocated leaseholders to preserve the integrity of its resource and operations, we cannot guaranty that these collocated leases will not interfere with AMSO, LLC\u2019s operations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Genie Oil and Gas\u2019 operational costs, cause delays and/or restrict our operations.\nThe production and processing of oil shale will result in some emission of greenhouse gases. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various phases of discussion or implementation. The Kyoto Protocol and other actual or pending federal, state and local regulations envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through market-based trading schemes. As a result of these and other potential environmental regulations, if our research and development activities are successful and we eventually begin commercial production, we can expect to incur additional capital, compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. To the extent these costs are not ultimately reflected in the price of the products we sell, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe oil and gas industry is subject to the general inherent industry and economic risks.\nThe oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity business. This means that potential future commercial operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices and by changes in margins on gasoline, natural gas and other refined products. For example, the recent worldwide decrease in oil prices would have a significant negative impact on potential future commercial operations.\nWe may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could cause us to lose significant rights and pay significant damage awards.\nOur success depends, among other things, on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how without infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties. The validity and scope of claims relating to our technology involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analysis. It is therefore difficult to accurately predict whether or not a third party will assert that we are infringing on its intellectual property or whether it would prevail. Although we are not currently aware of any infringement or of any parties pursuing or intending to pursue infringement claims against us, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such claims in the future. Also, in many jurisdictions, patent applications remain confidential and are not published for some period after filing. Thus, we may be unaware of other parties\u2019 pending patent applications that relate to our processes. While at present we are unaware of competing patent applications, such applications could potentially surface.\nThe defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, to pay ongoing royalties, to redesign our products, or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our products or the use of our technologies.\nRisk Related to Our Financial Condition and Reporting\nWe hold significant cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash - short-term, and certificates of deposit that are subject to various market risks.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash - short-term, and certificates of deposit of $58.5 million. As a result of various market risks, the value of these holdings could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the past, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could have impaired our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and potentially cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our published financial data.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. In evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThese material weaknesses were successfully remediated in 2014. We continue to work to improve our internal control process and diligently review our financial reporting controls and procedures. However, if our remedial measures prove to be insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nHolders of our Class B common stock and Series 2012-A Preferred Stock have significantly less voting power than holders of our Class A common stock.\nHolders of our Class B common stock and Series 2012-A Preferred Stock are entitled to one-tenth of a vote per share on all matters on which our stockholders are entitled to vote, while holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to three votes per share. As a result, the ability of holders of our Class B common stock and Series 2012-A Preferred Stock to influence our management is limited.\nHolders of our Series 2012-A Preferred Stock are entitled to an annual dividend and such payments may have a negative impact on our cash flow.\nHolders of our Series 2012-A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive an annual dividend, payable quarterly in cash. The payment of such dividend could have a negative impact on our cash flow and cash balances. If dividends on any shares of the Series 2012-A Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarters, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Series 2012-A Preferred Stock shall have the right to elect two (2) additional directors to serve on our Board, and this could have a negative impact on the market price of our equity securities.\nWe are controlled by our principal stockholder, which limits the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nHoward S. Jonas, our Chairman of the Board, has voting power over 6,915,034 shares of our common stock (which includes 1,574,326 shares of our Class A common stock, which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis, and 5,340,708 shares of our Class B common stock), representing approximately 73% of the\ncombined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, as of March 10, 2016. Mr. Jonas is able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors and the approval of significant corporate matters, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management is limited.", "PERMNO": 13019, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "GNE"}
