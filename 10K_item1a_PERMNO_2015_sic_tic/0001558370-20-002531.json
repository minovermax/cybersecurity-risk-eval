{"cik": "1327607", "company": "First Western Financial Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of, or that management currently deems immaterial, may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur banking, trust and wealth advisory operations are geographically concentrated in Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California, leading to significant exposure to those markets.\nOur business activities and credit exposure, including real estate collateral for many of our loans, are concentrated in Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California. As of December 31, 2019, 92.0% of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live in or conduct business in those states. This geographic concentration imposes risks from lack of geographic diversification. Difficult economic conditions, including state and local government deficits, in Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, where adverse economic developments, among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California or existing or prospective borrowers or property values in such areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated. This includes a sustained downturn in the oil and gas market, which is important for the general economic health of Colorado in particular. A prolonged period of low oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately $711.0 million, or 71.7%, of our gross loans were loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The repayment of such loans is highly dependent on the ability of the borrowers to meet their loan repayment obligations to us, which can be adversely affected by economic downturns that can lead to (i) declines in the rents and, therefore, in the cash flows generated by those real properties on which the borrowers depend to fund their loan payments to us, (ii) decreases in the values of those real properties, which make it more difficult for the borrowers to sell those real properties for amounts sufficient to repay their loans in full, and (iii) job losses of residential home buyers, which makes it more difficult for these borrowers to fund their loan payments. As a result, our operating results are more vulnerable to adverse changes in the real estate market than other financial institutions with more diversified loan portfolios, and we could incur losses in the event of changes in economic conditions that disproportionately affect the real estate markets.\nReal estate values in many of our markets have generally experienced periods of fluctuation over the last five years. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in our primary markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that adversely affect credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses or our ability to sell these loans on the secondary securitization market. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\"), which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,\nadverse weather events, including wildfires, flooding, and mudslides, can cause damages to the property pledged as collateral on loans, which could result in additional losses upon a foreclosure.\nThe implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require the Company to increase its allowance for credit losses and may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL. On July 17, 2019, the FASB voted to delay CECL implementation for certain companies including smaller reporting companies (\"SRCs\") as defined by the SEC. The Company is designated as a SRC with the SEC. The proposed delay by FASB was subject to a comment period. At the October 16, 2019 FASB meeting, the FASB voted unanimously to delay the effective date of CECL adoption for SRCs to January 1, 2023. CECL requires a change in the model to recognize a valuation allowance based on estimated expected credit losses over the life of the portfolio, compared to the probable incurred loss model. The change to the CECL framework will require the Company to greatly increase the data the Company must collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of CECL may result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses, depending on various factors and assumptions applied in the model, such as the forecasted economic conditions in the foreseeable future and loan payment behaviors. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we are unable to estimate the impact the adoption of this update will have on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures. However, the Company expects the impact of the adoption will be significantly influenced by the composition and characteristics of its loan portfolios along with economic conditions prevalent as of the date of adoption. The Company expects to implement the new standard beginning January 1, 2023.\nIf we are unable to continue to originate residential real estate loans and sell them into the secondary market for a profit, our earnings could decrease.\nWe derive a portion of our non-interest income from the origination of residential real estate loans and the subsequent sale of such loans into the secondary market. If we are unable to continue to originate and sell residential real estate loans at historical or greater levels, our residential real estate loan volume would decrease, which could decrease our earnings. A rising interest rate environment, general economic conditions, market volatility, or other factors beyond our control could adversely affect our ability to originate residential real estate loans. The financial services industry is experiencing an increase in regulations and compliance requirements related to mortgage loan originations necessitating technology upgrades and other changes. If new regulations continue to increase and we are unable to make technology upgrades, our ability to originate mortgage loans will be reduced or eliminated. Additionally, we sell a large portion of our residential real estate loans to third-party investors, and rising interest rates could negatively affect our ability to generate suitable profits on the sale of such loans. If interest rates increase after we originate the loans, our ability to market those loans is impaired as the profitability on the loans decreases. These fluctuations can have an adverse effect on the revenue we generate from residential real estate loans and in certain instances, could result in a loss on the sale of the loans.\nFurther, for the mortgage loans we sell in the secondary market, the mortgage loan sales contracts contain indemnification clauses should the loans default, generally within the first 90 - 120 days, or if documentation is determined not to be in compliance with regulations. While the Company has had no historic losses as a result of these indemnities, we could be required to repurchase the mortgage loans or reimburse the purchaser of our loans for losses incurred. Both of these situations could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our mortgage loan activities and negatively impact our net income.\nOur loan portfolio includes a significant number of commercial loans, which involve risks specific to commercial borrowers.\nOur loan portfolio includes a significant amount of commercial real estate loans and commercial lines of credit. Our typical commercial borrower is a small or medium-sized privately owned Colorado business entity. Our commercial loans typically have greater credit risks than standard residential mortgage or consumer loans because commercial loans often have larger balances, and repayment usually depends on the borrowers\u2019 successful business operations. Commercial\nloans also involve some additional risk because they generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and thus may require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity. If the general economy turns substantially downward, commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans, and the value of their assets, which are usually pledged as collateral, may decrease rapidly and significantly. Also, when credit markets tighten due to adverse developments in specific markets or the general economy, opportunities for refinancing may become more expensive or unavailable, resulting in loan defaults.\nWe may be subject to claims and litigation pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities.\nSome of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our clients and others. From time to time, third parties make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market for investment managers and professionals is extremely competitive and the loss of a key investment manager could adversely affect our investment advisory and wealth management business.\nWe believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors that affect the amount of assets under our management and, for that reason, the success of our business is heavily dependent on the quality and experience of our senior wealth management professionals and their track records in terms of making investment decisions that result in attractive investment returns for our clients. We consider the \"chairman\" and \"president\" roles in each of our profit center teams to be instrumental to executing our business strategy. However, the market for such investment professionals is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by frequent movement of these individuals among different firms. In addition, our individual investment professionals often have direct contact with particular clients, which can lead to a strong client relationship based on the client\u2019s trust in that individual manager. As a result, the loss of a key investment manager could jeopardize our relationships with some of our clients and lead to the loss of client accounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $58.9 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence and cause adverse changes to occur in the fair values of securities in that portfolio. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the investment securities in our portfolio, defaults by the issuers of such securities, concerns with respect to the enforceability of the payment or other key terms of such securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, as well as others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, the process for determining whether an impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments, which could subsequently prove to have been wrong, regarding the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer of the security, the fair value of any collateral underlying the security and whether and the extent to which the principal of and interest on the security will ultimately be paid in accordance with its payment terms.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of certain securities brokerage firms.\nWe do not provide custodial services for our clients. Instead, client investment accounts are maintained under custodial arrangements with large, well established securities brokerage firms or bank institutions that provide custodial services (collectively, \"brokerage firms\"), either directly or through arrangements made by us with those firms. As a result, the performance of, or even rumors or questions about the integrity or performance of, any of those brokerage firms could adversely affect the confidence of our clients in the services provided by those firms or otherwise adversely impact their custodial holdings. Such an occurrence could negatively impact our ability to retain existing or attract new clients and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe investment management contracts we have with our clients are terminable without cause and on relatively short notice by our clients, which makes us vulnerable to short-term declines in the performance of the securities under our management.\nLike most investment advisory and wealth management businesses, the investment advisory contracts we have with our clients are typically terminable by the client without cause upon less than 30 days\u2019 notice. As a result, even short-term declines in the performance of the securities we manage, which can result from factors outside our control, such as adverse changes in market or economic condition or the poor performance of some of the investments we have recommended to our clients, could lead some of our clients to move assets under our management to other asset classes such as broad index funds or treasury securities, or to investment advisors which have investment product offerings or investment strategies different than ours. Therefore, our operating results are heavily dependent on the financial performance of our investment portfolios and the investment strategies we employ in our investment advisory businesses and even short-term declines in the performance of the investment portfolios we manage for our clients, whatever the cause, could result in a decline in assets under management and a corresponding decline in investment management fees, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nFee revenue represents a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and is subject to decline, among other things, in the event of a reduction in, or changes to, the level or type of investment activity by our clients.\nA significant portion of our revenue results from fee-based services related to wealth advisory, private banking, personal trust, investment management, mortgage lending and institutional asset management services to derive revenue. This contrasts with many commercial banks that may rely more heavily on interest-based sources of revenue, such as loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, adjusted non-interest income represented approximately 50.2% of our consolidated gross revenue. The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our assets under custody and administration and our assets under management, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody) and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients.\nIn addition, our clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. Economic, market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with those institutions, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could materially reduce our fee revenue or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. These clients also, by their nature, are often able to exert considerable market influence, and this, combined with strong competitive forces in the markets for our services, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge for our services in both our asset servicing and asset management business lines.\nThe trust wealth management fees we receive may decrease as a result of poor investment performance, in either relative or absolute terms, which could decrease our revenues and net earnings.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues primarily from investment management fees based on assets under management. Our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including investors\u2019 perception of our past performance, in either relative or absolute terms, market and economic conditions, including changes in oil and gas prices, and competition from investment management companies. Financial markets are affected by many factors, all of which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, including changes in oil and gas prices; securities market conditions; the level and volatility of interest rates and equity prices; competitive conditions; liquidity of global markets; international and regional political conditions; regulatory and legislative developments; monetary and fiscal policy; investor sentiment; availability and cost of capital; technological changes and events; outcome of legal proceedings; changes in currency values; inflation; credit ratings; and the size, volume and timing of transactions. A decline in the fair value of the assets under management, caused by a decline in general economic conditions, would decrease our wealth management fee income.\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new wealth management clients. Poor investment performance could reduce our revenues and impair our growth in the following ways:\n\u00b7\nExisting clients may withdraw funds from our wealth management business in favor of better performing products;\n\u00b7\nAsset-based management fees could decline from a decrease in assets under management;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and\n\u00b7\nOur portfolio managers may depart, to join a competitor or otherwise.\nEven when market conditions are generally favorable, our investment performance may be adversely affected by the investment style of our asset managers and the particular investments that they make. To the extent our future investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or absolute terms, the revenues and profitability of our wealth management business will likely be reduced and our ability to attract new clients will likely be impaired. As such, fluctuations in the equity and debt markets can have a direct impact upon our net earnings.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our net interest margins and net interest income.\nInterest rates are key drivers of our net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond our control. Income and cash flows from our banking operations depend to a great extent on the difference or \"spread\" between the interest we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the rates at which we pay interest on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. Rapidly increasing interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of a divergence in financial instrument maturities or competitive pressures. Further, substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease net interest income. Also, changes in interest rates might also impact the values of equity and debt securities under management and administration, which may have a negative impact on fee income.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including (among others) general and regional and local economic conditions, the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, bank regulatory requirements, competition from other banks and financial institutions and a change over time in the mix of our loans and investment securities, on the one hand, and on our deposits and other liabilities, on the other hand. Changes in monetary policy will, in particular, influence the origination and market value of and the yields we can realize on loans and investment securities, and the interest we pay on deposits. Additionally, sustained low levels of market interest rates, as we have experienced during the past decade, could continue to place downward pressure on our net interest margins and, therefore, on our earnings.\nOur net interest margins and earnings also could be adversely affected if we are unable to adjust our interest rates on loans and deposits on a timely basis in response to changes in economic conditions or monetary policies. For example, if the rates of interest we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities increase faster than we are able to increase the rates of interest we charge on loans or the yields we realize on investments and other interest-earning assets, our net interest income and, therefore, our earnings will decrease. In particular, the rates of interest we charge on loans may be subject to longer fixed interest periods compared to the interest we must pay on deposits. On the other hand, increasing interest rates generally lead to increases in net interest income; however, such increases also may result in a reduction in loan originations, declines in loan prepayment rates and reductions in the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations, which could result in increased loan defaults and charge-offs and could require increases to our ALLL, thereby offsetting either partially or totally the increases in net interest income resulting from the increase in interest rates. Additionally, we could be prevented from increasing the interest rates we charge on loans or from reducing the interest rates we offer on deposits due to \"price\" competition from other banks and financial institutions with which we compete. Conversely, in a declining interest rate environment, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rates we are able to charge on loans or other investments decline more quickly than those we pay on deposits and borrowings.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define and use LIBOR have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of designated rates in contracts and financial instruments or such designated rates ceasing to be acceptable reference rates. This uncertainty could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments.\nWe have a significant number of loans and borrowings with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements and GAAP, we maintain an ALLL to provide for incurred loan and lease losses and a reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to absorb actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience and an evaluation of the risks inherent in our then-current portfolio. The amount of future losses may also vary depending on changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal and state regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and leases and allowance for loan losses. While we believe our allowance for loan losses is appropriate for the risk identified in our loan and lease portfolio, we may need to increase the allowance for loan losses, such increases may not be sufficient to address losses, and regulators may require us to increase this allowance even further. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions and global trade.\nOur businesses and operations, including our private bank and trust services, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits, investing in securities and investment management, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the United States economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries and weakening global trade due to increased anti-globalization sentiment, war, epidemics (including the recent coronavirus), or other unforeseen events could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder the economic growth of the United States. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity or depressed prices in the secondary market for loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. The current economic environment\nis also characterized by interest rates remaining at historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our investment portfolio. Further, a general economic slowdown could decrease the value of assets under management and administration by our trust services resulting in lower fee income, and clients potentially seeking alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which could result in lower fee income to us. All of these factors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Broad market performance may not be favorable in the future.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by external business disruptors in the financial services industry.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid change, as technology enables non-traditional new entrants to compete in certain segments of the banking market, in some cases with reduced regulation. New entrants may use new technologies, advanced data and analytic tools, lower cost to serve, reduced regulatory burden or faster processes to challenge traditional banks. For example, new business models have been observed in retail payments, consumer and commercial lending, foreign exchange and low-cost investment advisory services. While we closely monitor business disruptors and seek to adapt to changing technologies, matching the pace of innovation exhibited by new and differently situated competitors may require us and policy-makers to adapt at a greater pace.\nWe have pledged all of the stock of the Bank as collateral for a loan and if the lender forecloses, you could lose your investment.\nWe have pledged all of the stock of the Bank as collateral for a third-party loan. The loan had no balance as of December 31, 2019. If we were to incur indebtedness under this loan and default, the lender of such loan could foreclose on the Bank\u2019s stock and we would lose our principal asset. In that event, if the value of the Bank\u2019s stock is less than the amount of the indebtedness, you could lose the entire amount of your investment.\nLiquidity risk could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and hurt our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our banking business, as we use cash to make loans and purchase investment securities and other interest-earning assets and to fund deposit withdrawals that occur in the ordinary course of our business. Our principal sources of liquidity include earnings, deposits, repayment by clients of loans we have made to them, and the proceeds from sales by us of our equity securities or from borrowings that we may obtain. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the acquisition of national market non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances, access to the Federal Reserve discount window and the issuance of additional equity securities. If our ability to obtain funds from these sources becomes limited or the costs of those funds increase, whether due to factors that affect us specifically, including our financial performance, or due to factors that affect the financial services industry in general, including weakening economic conditions or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, then our ability to grow our banking and investment advisory and trust businesses would be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nWe depend on checking and savings deposit account balances and other forms of client deposits as our primary source of funding for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to maintain and grow a strong deposit base and our ability to retain our largest trust clients, many of whom are also depositors. We may not be able to grow and maintain our deposit base. The account and deposit balances can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or real estate, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If clients, including our trust clients, move money out of bank deposits and into investments (or similar deposit products at other institutions that may provide a higher rate of return), we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. We also have increased risks from losses of bank deposit clients due to the large deposits we hold from certain clients. For example, as of December 31, 2019, 19.2% and 32.9% of our total deposits consisted of our 10 largest depositors and allocations to interest-bearing accounts for certain other trust clients deposits we manage, respectively. Loss of any one of these deposit clients would have an outsized impact\non our results of operations. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations, which could materially negatively impact our growth strategy.\nWe receive substantial deposits and assets under management as a result of referrals by professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and doctors, and such referrals are dependent upon the continued positive interaction with and financial health of those referral sources.\nMany of our deposit clients and clients of our private trust bank offices are individuals involved in professional vocations, such as lawyers, accountants, and doctors. These clients are a significant source of referrals for new clients in both the deposit and wealth management areas. If we fail to adequately serve these professional clients with our deposit services, lending, and wealth management products, this source of referrals may diminish, which could have a negative impact on our results. Further, if the economy in the geographic areas that we serve is negatively impacted, the amount of deposits and services that these professional individuals will utilize and the amount of referrals that they will make may decrease, which may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur largest trust client accounts for 37.0% of our total assets under management.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our largest trust client accounted for, in the aggregate, 37.0% of our total assets under management and 2.1% of our non-interest income. As a result, a material decrease in the volume of those trust assets by that client could materially reduce our assets under management, which would adversely affect our non-interest income and, therefore, our results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on achieving our strategic objectives, including through acquisitions which may not increase our profitability and may adversely affect our future operating results.\nSince we commenced our banking business in 2004, we have grown our banking franchise and now have fourteen locations in Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California, including a centralized operations center in downtown Denver. We plan to continue to grow our banking business both organically and through acquisitions of other banks and financial service providers, which may include entry into new markets. However, the implementation of our growth strategy poses a number of risks for us, including that:\n\u00b7\nAny newly established offices may not generate revenues in amounts sufficient to cover the start-up costs of those offices, which would reduce our earnings;\n\u00b7\nAcquisitions we might consummate in the future may prove not to be accretive to or may reduce our earnings if we do not realize anticipated cost savings, or if we incur unanticipated costs in integrating the acquired businesses into our operations or if a substantial number of the clients of any of the acquired businesses move their business to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nSuch expansion efforts will divert management time and effort from our existing banking operations, which could adversely affect our future financial performance; and\n\u00b7\nAdditional capital which we may need to support our growth or the issuance of shares in any acquisitions will be dilutive of the investments that our existing shareholders have in the shares of our common stock that they own and in their respective percentage ownership interests they have in the Company.\nWe face intense competition from other banks and financial institutions and other wealth and investment management firms that could hurt our business.\nWe conduct our business operations in markets where the banking business is highly competitive and is dominated by large multi-state and in-state banks with operations and offices covering wide geographic areas. We also compete with other financial service businesses, including investment advisory and wealth management firms, mutual fund companies, financial technology companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive banking and financial products and services as well as products and services that we do not offer. Larger banks and many of those other financial service organizations have greater financial and marketing resources than we do that enable them to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift resources to regions or activities of greater potential\nprofitability. They also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits than we do, which enable them to attract larger clients and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits and investment management clients. If we are unable to compete effectively with those banking or other financial services businesses, we could find it more difficult to attract new and retain existing clients and our net interest margins, net interest income and investment management fees could decline, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects, and could cause us to incur losses in the future.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully attract and retain investment advisory and wealth management clients is dependent on our ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful in retaining existing and attracting new investment management clients, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our internal growth strategy or be able to manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth through opening new boutique private trust bank offices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy includes pursuing organic and internal growth and evaluating strategic opportunities to grow through opening new boutique private trust bank offices. We believe that banking location expansion has been meaningful to our growth since inception. We intend to pursue an organic growth strategy in addition to our acquisition strategy, the success of which is dependent on our ability to generate an increasing level of loans, deposits and assets under management at acceptable risk levels without incurring corresponding increases in non-interest expense. Opening new offices carries with it certain potential risks, including significant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses; an inability to gain regulatory approval; an inability to secure the services of qualified senior management to operate the new offices and successfully integrate and promote our corporate culture; poor market reception for our new offices established in markets where we do not have a preexisting reputation; challenges posed by local economic conditions; challenges associated with securing attractive locations at a reasonable cost; and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls. Further, we may not be successful in our organic growth strategies generally due to, among other factors, delays in introducing and implementing new products and services and other impediments resulting from regulatory oversight, lack of qualified personnel at existing locations. In addition, the success of our internal growth strategy will depend on maintaining sufficient regulatory capital levels and on favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth, including growth through creating new boutique private trust bank offices, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAlthough we plan to grow our business internally, we may expand our business by acquiring other banks and financial services companies, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nWhile a key element of our business plan is to grow our banking franchise and increase our market share through internal and organic growth, we intend to take advantage of opportunities to acquire other banks, investment advisors, and other financial services companies as such opportunities present themselves. However, we may not succeed in seizing such opportunities when they arise. Our ability to execute on acquisition opportunities may require us to raise additional capital and to increase our capital position to support the growth of our franchise. It will also depend on market conditions; over which we have no control. Moreover, any acquisitions may require the approval of our bank regulators and we may not be able to obtain such approvals on acceptable terms, if at all.\nAcquisition and divestitures may subject us to integration risks and other unknown risks.\nAlthough we plan to continue to grow our business organically and through opening new boutique private trust bank offices, we also intend to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe complement our activities and have the ability to enhance our profitability and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. We also intend to explore the divestiture of assets and businesses that do not fit within our strategic plan. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the failure to: adequately centralize and standardize policies, procedures, products, and processes; combine employee benefit plans and compensation cultures; implement a unified investment policy and make related adjustments to combined investment portfolios; implement a unified loan policy and conform lending authority; implement a standard loan management system; avoid delays in implementing new policies or procedures; and\napply new policies or procedures. In addition, divestitures pose unique risks including the failure to: close the divestiture, manage expenses associated with the divestiture, retain employees and effectively manage a business or assets subject to divestiture.\nCertain events may arise before the date of an acquisition or divestiture but after the announcement of an acquisition or divestiture, or we may learn of certain facts, events or circumstances, that may affect our financial condition or performance or subject us to risk of loss. Certain events may arise after the date of an acquisition or divestiture, or we may learn of certain facts, events or circumstances after the closing of an acquisition or divestiture, that may affect our financial condition or performance or subject us to risk of loss. It is possible that we could undertake an acquisition that subsequently does not perform in line with our financial or strategic objectives or expectations. These events include, but are not limited to: retaining key associates and clients, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting expectations and otherwise realizing the undertaking\u2019s anticipated benefits; litigation resulting from circumstances occurring at the acquired entity prior to the date of acquisition; loan downgrades and loan loss provisions resulting from underwriting of certain acquired loans determined not to meet our credit standards; personnel changes that cause instability within a department; and other events relating to the performance of our business. In addition, if we determined that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill was impaired, an impairment of goodwill charge to earnings would be recognized.\nAcquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and we cannot determine all potential events, facts and circumstances that could result in loss or increased costs. Our due diligence or mitigation efforts may not be sufficient to protect against any such loss or increased costs.\nWe may be required to recognize a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Our annual goodwill impairment assessment date for the Company\u2019s reporting units is October 31. Goodwill impairment testing includes an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether certain circumstances or events exist that lead to a determination that the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. This qualitative assessment includes various factors that could affect the reporting unit\u2019s fair value as well as mitigating events or conditions. One such factor that could impact the assessment are the conditions within the markets that trade the Company\u2019s stock. The assessment of each reporting unit compares the aggregate fair value to its carrying value, along with several valuation assumptions and methods in order to determine if any impairment was triggered as of the measurement date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the results of impairment testing on our intangible assets will have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels. There is no guarantee that we may not be forced to recognize impairment charges in the future as operating and economic conditions change or as part of strategic divestitures. The recognition of a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements resulting from any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements and our estimates and assumptions may not be accurate.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Critical estimates are made by management in determining, among other things, the ALLL, amounts of impairment of assets, intangibles, and valuation of income taxes. If our underlying estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security, and cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and\nsecurity systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us, our clients, or third parties with whom we interact and that may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of confidential information belonging to us or personal or confidential information belonging to our clients, misappropriation of assets, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Our industry has seen increases in electronic fraudulent activity, hacking, security breaches, sophisticated social engineering and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, including in the commercial banking sector, as cyber-criminals have been targeting commercial bank and brokerage accounts on an increasing basis.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. All of these factors increase our risks related to cyber-threats and electronic disruptions.\nIn addition to well-known risks related to fraudulent activity, which take many forms, such as check \"kiting\" or fraud, wire fraud, and other dishonest acts, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents have become a material risk in the financial services industry. These threats may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to data processing or data storage systems used by us or by our clients, electronic identity theft, \"phishing,\" account takeover, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. These electronic viruses or malicious code are typically designed to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nObtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to us or our clients and customers;\n\u00b7\nManipulate or destroy data;\n\u00b7\nDisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on a financial institution\u2019s systems; or\n\u00b7\nSteal money.\nIn recent periods, several governmental agencies and large corporations, including financial service organizations and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only their confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients or their employees or other third parties, and subjecting those agencies and corporations to potential fraudulent activity and their clients, employees and other third parties to identity theft and fraudulent activity in their credit card and banking accounts. Therefore, security breaches and cyber-attacks can cause significant increases in operating costs, including the costs of compensating clients and customers for any resulting losses they may incur and the costs and capital expenditures required to correct the deficiencies in and strengthen the security of data processing and storage systems.\nUnfortunately, it is not always possible to anticipate, detect, or recognize these threats to our systems, or to implement effective preventative measures against all breaches, whether those breaches are malicious or accidental. Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years and have been difficult to detect before they occur because of, among other reasons:\n\u00b7\nThe proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions;\n\u00b7\nThese threats arising from numerous sources, not all of which are in our control, including among others human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, natural disasters or severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts;\n\u00b7\nThe techniques used in cyber-attacks changing frequently and possibly not being recognized until launched or until well after the breach has occurred;\n\u00b7\nThe increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage;\n\u00b7\nThe vulnerability of systems to third parties seeking to gain access to such systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems; and\n\u00b7\nOur frequent transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including our vendors and regulators, and possible weaknesses that go undetected in our data systems notwithstanding the testing we conduct of those systems.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber-attacks or other information, we may suffer such losses or other consequences in the future. While we invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and we conduct periodic tests of our security systems and processes, we may not succeed in anticipating or adequately protecting against or preventing all security breaches and cyber-attacks from occurring. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. While we had insurance against losses related to cyber-attacks as of the filing date of this Form 10-K, we may not be able to insure against losses related to cyber-threats in the future and our insurance may not insure against all possible losses. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents.\nAs is the case with non-electronic fraudulent activity, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology and related services from third-party service providers and we may suffer an interruption in those systems.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities. In addition to customers and clients, the third parties with whom we interact and upon whom we rely include financial counterparties; financial intermediaries such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses; vendors; regulators; providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power; and other parties for whom we process transactions. Each of these third parties faces the risk of cyber-attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure. Any such cyber-attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure of a third party could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses. Additionally, interruptions in service and security breaches could damage our reputation, lead existing clients to terminate their business relationships with us, make it more difficult for us to attract new clients and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possibly financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve clients and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many national vendors provide turn-key services that allow smaller banks to compete with institutions that have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able, however, to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients and key associates could be adversely affected if our reputation is harmed.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients and key associates could be adversely affected if our reputation is harmed. Any actual or perceived failure to address various issues could cause reputational harm, including a failure to address any of the following types of issues: legal and regulatory requirements; the proper maintenance or protection of the privacy of client and employee financial or other personal information; record keeping deficiencies or errors; money-laundering; and potential conflicts of interest or ethical issues. Moreover, any failure to appropriately address any issues of this nature could give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, and legal risks, which could lead to costly litigation or subject us to enforcement actions, fines, or penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. In addition, our banking, investment advisory and wealth management businesses are dependent on the integrity of our banking personnel and our investment advisory and wealth managers. Lapses in integrity could cause reputational harm to our businesses that could lead to the loss of existing clients and make it more difficult for us to attract new clients and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may incur significant losses due to ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposures through a comprehensive risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, transactional, operational and compliance systems, and internal control and management testing and review processes. However, those systems and review processes and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and, as a result, we may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes, particularly in the event of the kinds of dislocations in market conditions experienced in recent years, which highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. If those systems and review processes prove to be ineffective in identifying and managing risks, or testing scenarios not reveal real-life failures of technology, we could be subjected to increased regulatory scrutiny and regulatory restrictions could be imposed on our business, including on our potential future business lines, as a result of which our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, such as coronavirus, or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme terrestrial or solar weather events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses. In particular, Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, and especially California, in which a substantial portion of our business is located, have been susceptible to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, and wildfires. The nature and level of such events cannot be predicted. These catastrophic events could harm our operations through interference with technology, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, telephone communications and other technology-dependent services which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. Additionally, natural disasters could negatively impact the values of collateral securing our borrowers\u2019 loans and interrupt our borrowers\u2019 abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, either of which could result in losses and increased provisions for loan losses for us.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties that we may acquire.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we acquire, by or in lieu of foreclosure, real properties which collateralize nonperforming loans. As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even if we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination and those activities took place prior to our ownership of the properties. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. We may invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new lines of business or new products and services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible or may be dependent on identifying and hiring a qualified person to lead the division. In addition, existing management personnel may not have the experience or capacity to provide effective oversight of new lines of business or new products and services.\nExternal factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service and result in consumer harm. Furthermore, any new line of business or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on customer and counterparty information, which subjects us to risks if that information is not accurate or is incomplete.\nWhen deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers or counterparties, we may rely on information provided by or on behalf of those customers and counterparties, including audited financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations made by customers and counterparties that the information they provide is accurate and complete. We conduct appropriate due diligence on such customer information and, where practical and economical, we engage valuation and other experts or sources of information to assist with assessing collateral and other customer risks. Our financial results could be adversely affected if the financial statements, collateral value or other financial information provided by customers or counterparties are incorrect.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, and legislative or regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily to protect clients, depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance fund, and the banking system as a whole, not our shareholders. We are subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the CDB. The banking laws, regulations and policies applicable to us govern matters ranging from the maintenance of adequate capital, safety and soundness, mergers and changes in control to the general business operations conducted by us, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, the amount of reserves held against deposits, restrictions on dividends, imposition of specific accounting requirements, establishment of new offices and the maximum interest rate that may be charged on loans.\nWe are subject to changes in federal and state banking statutes, regulations and governmental policies, or the interpretation or implementation of them, and are subject to changes and increased complexity in regulatory requirements\nas governments and regulators continue reforms intended to strengthen the stability of the financial system and protect key markets and participants. Any changes in any federal or state banking statute, regulation or governmental policy, including changes which occurred in 2019 and may occur in 2020 and beyond during the current and future administration, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. In addition, federal and state banking regulators have broad authority to supervise our banking business and that of our subsidiaries, including the authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices or constitute violations of statute, rule, regulation, or administrative order. Failure to comply with any such laws, regulations or regulatory policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, restrictions on our business activities, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions which we are, or may become, subject to as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, SEC, and the CDB may conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a result of an examination, regulatory agencies may determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentrations, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, or other aspects of any of our operations are unsatisfactory, or that we or our management are in violation of any law, regulation or guideline in effect from time to time. Regulatory agencies may take a number of different remedial actions, including the power to enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the composition of our concentrations in portfolio or balance sheet assets, to assess civil monetary penalties against officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, the FDIC may terminate our deposit insurance. A regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve, and on July 9, 2013, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \"OCC\"), adopted a final rule that implements the Basel III changes to the international regulatory capital framework and revises the U.S. risk-based and leverage capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations to strengthen identified areas of weakness in capital rules and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule established a stricter regulatory capital framework that requires banking organizations to hold more and higher-quality capital to act as a financial cushion to absorb losses and help banking organizations better withstand periods of financial stress. The final rule increased capital ratios for all banking organizations and introduced a \"capital conservation buffer\" which is in addition to each capital ratio. If a banking organization dips into its capital conservation buffer, it may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends and discretionary bonus payments to its executive officers. The final rule assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also required unrealized gains and losses on certain \"available-for-sale\" securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. We exercised this opt-out right in our March 31, 2015 quarterly financial filing. The final rule also included changes in what constitutes regulatory capital. These changes included the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock are required to be deducted from capital.\nThe final rule became effective for us on January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2019, we met all of these capital requirements, including the full capital conservation buffer.\nAlthough we currently cannot predict the specific impact and long-term effects that Basel III will have on our Company and the banking industry more generally, the Company will be required to maintain higher regulatory capital\nlevels which could impact our operations, net income and ability to grow. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against us which could restrict our future growth or operations.\nNew and future rulemaking by the CFPB and other regulators, as well as enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and operating costs.\nThe CFPB has the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing federal consumer protection statutes and to issue new regulations but, with respect to institutions of our size, does not have primary examination and enforcement authority with respect to such laws and regulations. The authority to examine depository institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets, like us, for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with our primary federal regulator, the FDIC. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of smaller institutions on a \"sampling basis\" and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. In some cases, regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice also retain certain rulemaking or enforcement authority, and we also remain subject to certain state consumer protection laws. As an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has placed significant emphasis on consumer complaint management and has established a public consumer complaint database to encourage consumers to file complaints they may have against financial institutions. We are expected to monitor and respond to these complaints, including those that we deem frivolous, and doing so may require management to reallocate resources away from more profitable endeavors.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC and the Federal Reserve have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify potential concentrations in commercial real estate lending. A financial institution may have such a concentration if, among other factors: (i) total outstanding loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital (\"CRE 1 Concentration\"); or (ii) total outstanding loans for construction, land development and other land and loans secured by multifamily and non-owner occupied non-farm, non-residential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital (\"CRE 2 Concentration\") and the institution\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. In such an instance, management should employ heightened risk management practices, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. As of December 31, 2019, our CRE 1 Concentration level was 54.5% and our CRE 2 Concentration level was 171.4%. We may, at some point, be considered to have a concentration in the future, or our risk management practices may be found to be deficient, which could result in increased reserves and capital costs as well as potential regulatory enforcement action.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, the CFPB and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of any financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the GLB Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share non-public personal information about our clients with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to clients about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford clients the right to \"opt out\" of any information sharing by us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of client information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states and foreign countries have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States and other countries are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting client or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe can be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to conduct risk.\nSuch legal and regulatory activities could result in significant penalties and other negative impacts on our businesses and results of operations. At any given time, we can be involved in defending legal and regulatory proceedings and are subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations and other inquiries. The frequency with which such proceedings, investigations and inquiries are initiated have increased over the last few years, and the global judicial, regulatory and political environment generally remains hostile to financial institutions. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, conditions the granting of cooperation credit in civil and criminal investigations\nof corporate wrongdoing on the company involved having provided to investigators all relevant facts relating to the individuals responsible for the alleged misconduct. The complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Moreover, U.S. authorities have been increasingly focused on \"conduct risk,\" a term that is used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents, including third-party vendors, that could harm clients, consumers, investors or the markets, such as failures to safeguard consumers\u2019 and investors\u2019 personal information, failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest and improperly creating, selling and marketing products and services. In addition to increasing compliance risks, this focus on conduct risk could lead to more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings and litigation, including for practices which historically were acceptable but are now receiving greater scrutiny. Further, while we take numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm customers, investors or the markets, such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented. Banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of financial services firms. In addition to regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result from perceived deficiencies in our culture, such focus could also lead to additional regulatory proceedings.\nFirst Western Capital Management Company\u2019s business is highly regulated, and the regulators have the ability to limit or restrict, and impose fines or other sanctions on, its business.\nFirst Western Capital Management Company, our wholly owned registered investment advisor subsidiary (\"FWCM\"), is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Advisers Act\"), and its business is highly regulated. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, trading, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. Moreover, the Investment Advisers Act grants broad administrative powers to regulatory agencies such as the SEC to regulate investment advisory businesses. If the SEC or other government agencies believe that FWCM has failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, these agencies have the power to impose fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions, which could include revocation of FWCM\u2019s registration under, which could be material, the Investment Advisers Act. We are also subject to the provisions and regulations of ERISA to the extent that we act as a \"fiduciary\" under ERISA with respect to certain of our clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws, impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. Additionally, like other investment advisory and wealth management companies, FWCM also faces the risks of lawsuits by clients. The outcome of regulatory proceedings and lawsuits is uncertain and difficult to predict. An adverse resolution of any regulatory proceeding or lawsuit against FWCM could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to FWCM and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on the ability of FWCM to retain key relationship and wealth managers, and to retain existing clients or attract new clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may affect the market price and trading volume of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u00b7\nChanges in economic or business conditions;\n\u00b7\nThe effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u00b7\nPublication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u00b7\nOperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nAdditional or anticipated sales of our common stock or other securities by us or our existing shareholders;\n\u00b7\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nPrevailing market conditions, including increased general market volatility associated with recent fears of pandemics;\n\u00b7\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors or us;\n\u00b7\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us;\n\u00b7\nOther economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and\n\u00b7\nOther news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our primary markets or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to actual or anticipated issuances or sales of our common stock in the future.\nActual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate. The issuance of any shares of our common stock in the future also would, and equity-related securities could, dilute the percentage ownership interest held by shareholders prior to such issuance.\nIn addition, we may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments and pursuant to compensation and incentive plans. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition or under a compensation or incentive plan), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of our securities.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than other larger financial institutions.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired\ncharacteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which will increase our costs of operations and may divert focus from our business operations.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we did not incur as a private company, particularly after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company.\nWe expect to incur substantial costs related to operating as a public company, and these costs may be higher when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the PCAOB and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, compliance with these reporting requirements and other SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market rules makes certain operating activities more time-consuming, and has caused us to incur significant new legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. Furthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our operating strategy, which could prevent us from successfully implementing our strategic initiatives and improving our results of operations. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will materially increase our general and administrative expenses and such increases will reduce our profitability.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As a public company, we are required to make annual assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, when we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nA significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company\u2019s financial reporting. We have implemented measures designed to address historical internal control significant deficiencies and will continue to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nWe will continue to periodically test and update, as necessary, our internal control systems, including our financial reporting controls. In addition, we hired additional accounting personnel as part of our transition from a private company to a public company. Our actions, however, may not be sufficient to result in an effective internal control environment and any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, impair our access to the capital markets, cause the price of our common stock to decline and subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and/or penalties, and higher risk of shareholder litigation.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate or continue coverage on us.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover us. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline. If we are covered by securities analysts and are the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur management and board of directors have significant control over our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,939,597 shares, or approximately 23.6% of our shares of common stock. Consequently, our management and board of directors may be able to significantly affect our affairs and policies, including the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. This influence may also have the effect of delaying or preventing changes of control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our Company. The interests of these insiders could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders, including you.\nWe may issue new debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have issued $6.6 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due 2026. In the future, we may increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or equity securities, which may include senior or additional subordinated notes, classes of preferred shares or common shares. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Preferred shares and debt, if issued, have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend or interest payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our common stock. Future issuances and sales of parity preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may also cause prevailing market prices for the series of preferred stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us. Further issuances of our common stock could be dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness, and is effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non-common equity claims against our subsidiaries.\nShares of our common stock represent equity interests in the Company and do not constitute indebtedness. Accordingly, the shares of our common stock rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on the Company with respect to assets available to satisfy such claims. Additionally, dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights any preferred stock we may issue.\nThe Company\u2019s right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise, and thus the ability of the Company\u2019s common shareholders to benefit indirectly from such distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. As a result, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of its subsidiaries, including claims of depositors.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10 million shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe are dependent upon the Bank for cash flow, and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted.\nOur primary tangible asset is the stock of the Bank. As such, we depend upon the Bank for cash distributions (through dividends on the Bank\u2019s common stock) that we use to pay our operating expenses, satisfy our obligations (including our preferred dividends, subordinated debentures, notes, and our other debt obligations) and to pay dividends on our common stock. Federal statutes, regulations and policies restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to us. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. In addition, there are certain restrictions imposed by federal banking laws, regulations and authorities on the payment of dividends by us and by the Bank. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we will not be able to satisfy our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends paid to us by the Bank, which we use as the principal source of funds to pay our expenses and to pay dividends to our shareholders, if any. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay us. If the Bank does not receive regulatory approval or does not maintain a level of capital sufficient to permit it to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, our ability to pay our expenses and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy in relation to the organization\u2019s overall asset quality, current and prospective earnings and level, composition and quality of capital. The guidance provides that we inform and consult with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to our capital structure, including interest on the subordinated debentures underlying our trust preferred securities and our other debt obligations. If required payments on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures, held by our unconsolidated subsidiary trusts, or our other debt obligations, are not made or are deferred, or dividends on any preferred stock we may issue are not paid, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.\nOur corporate organizational documents and provisions of federal and state law to which we are subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition that you may favor or an attempted replacement of our board of directors or management.\nOur articles of incorporation and our bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control or a replacement of our incumbent board of directors or management. Our governing documents include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nEmpower our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to issue our preferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are to be set by our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nProvide that directors may only be removed from office for cause;\n\u00b7\nEliminate cumulative voting in elections of directors;\n\u00b7\nPermit our board of directors to alter, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or to adopt new bylaws;\n\u00b7\nProhibit shareholder action by less than unanimous written consent, thereby requiring virtually all actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders;\n\u00b7\nRequire shareholders that wish to bring business before annual or special meetings of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of shareholders, to provide timely notice of their intent in writing; and\n\u00b7\nEnable our board of directors to increase, between annual meetings, the number of persons serving as directors and to fill the vacancies created as a result of the increase by a majority vote of the directors present at a meeting of directors.\nBanking laws also impose notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \"control\" of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company. These laws include the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, or the CBCA. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nFurthermore, our bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located in Denver County, Colorado, the county in which the city of Denver is located, will be the exclusive forum for: (i) any actual or purported derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty by any of our directors or officers; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or our directors or officers arising pursuant to the Colorado Business Corporations Act, our articles of incorporation, or our bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or our officers or directors that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a shareholder of our Company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our bylaws related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our bylaws may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nOur common stock is not a savings accounts, deposits or other obligations of any of our bank or nonbank subsidiaries and will not be insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Your investment in our common stock is subject to investment risk, and you must be capable of affording the loss of your entire investment.", "PERMNO": 17970, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MYFW"}
