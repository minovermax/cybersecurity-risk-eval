RISK FACTORS\nWe make written and oral statements from time to time, including statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our business and prospects, such as projections of future performance, statements of management\u2019s plans and objectives, forecasts of market trends and other matters that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements containing the words or phrases \u201cwill likely result,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201care expected to,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cis anticipated,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements which may appear in documents, reports, filings with the SEC, news releases, written or oral presentations made by our officers or other representatives to analysts, shareholders, investors, news organizations, and others, and discussions with our management and other representatives of our company. For such statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nOur future results, including results related to forward-looking statements, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. No assurance can be given that the results reflected in any forward-looking statements will be achieved. Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date on which such statement is made. Our forward-looking statements are based upon our management\u2019s current estimates and projections of future results or trends. Although we believe that our plans and objectives reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we may not achieve these plans or objectives. In addition, forward-looking statements may reflect assumptions that are sometimes based upon estimates, data, communications and other information from suppliers, government agencies and other sources that may be subject to revision. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or keep current either (i) any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of such statement, or (ii) the important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or which are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement which may be made by us or on our behalf.\nIn addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement that may be made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nHealth concerns arising from the recent global coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak or other diseases have and may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. As a result, public health measures were taken to minimize exposure to the virus. These measures, some of which are government-mandated, have been implemented globally resulting in a dramatic decrease in economic activity. During the first quarter of 2021, mandated restrictions began to ease in a number of the markets in which the Company operates. Although the Company has experienced some recovery from the initial impact of COVID-19, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy and on its business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. As new variants of COVID-19 are being discovered and cases in unvaccinated people rise throughout the markets in which the Company does business, the Company cannot predict the severity of another surge, what additional restrictions may be enacted, to what extent it can maintain off-premise sales volumes, whether it can maintain sufficient staffing levels, or if individuals will be comfortable returning to its dining rooms during or following social distancing protocols, and what long-lasting effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the restaurants industry as a whole. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer spending behavior, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses, will determine the significance of the impact to the Company\u2019s operating results and financial position.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this report. Despite the fact that vaccines are now widely available across the country, there were widespread increases in diagnosed cases reported since the end of the second quarter largely due to the spread of COVID-19 variants. The duration of the disruption on global, national, and local economies cannot be reasonably estimated at this time due to the ongoing effects of this situation. Management is continually evaluating the impact of this global crisis on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce and will take additional actions as necessary.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of other viruses, norovirus, Avian Flu or \u201cSARS,\u201d and H1N1 or \u201cswine flu,\u201d or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as \u201cmad cow disease.\u201d To the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products.\nThe complete integration of the operations of newly acquired restaurants may prove to be more difficult, costly and time consuming than expected, which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits and synergies of such acquisitions.\nThe acquisitions of various restaurants have involved substantial non-recurring costs, including significant transaction costs, regulatory costs and integration costs, such as facilities, systems and employment-related costs, and we may incur unanticipated costs or unknown liabilities which may be significant. Uncertainties associated with the manner in which the combined company following acquisitions will fare in the global economic environment may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business and operations. The operations of various concepts can lead us to incur unknown or new types of costs and liabilities, subject us to new regulatory and compliance frameworks, new market risks, involve operations in new geographies and challenging labor, regulatory and tax regimes as well as the execution and compliance costs and risks associated with such activities.\nUncertainties associated with restaurant acquisitions may adversely affect our brands\u2019 respective abilities to attract and retain management and other key employees during the integration periods, and may disrupt our businesses which could impact our ability to retain customers, adversely affecting each or all our concept\u2019s respective businesses and operations, which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.\nA failure to maintain continued compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities may result in termination of the credit facilities and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to accomplish our business objectives.\nOn November 23, 2021, we and certain of our affiliates entered into a credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. providing for a up to $5.0 million revolving line and $15.0 million term loan (collectively \u201cLoan\u201d). We are subject to various financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement. The Company\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of its assets, excluding real property.\nAs of January 2, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Loan; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of our financial and non-financial covenants in the future. A failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be in default of our credit agreement and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. would be within its rights to accelerate the maturity dates of any amount owed on the Loan. If we were unable to repay outstanding amounts, either using current cash reserves, a replacement facility or another source of capital, our lender would have the right to foreclose on our personal property, which serves as collateral for the Loan. Replacement financing may be unavailable to us on similar terms or at all. Termination of the Loan without adequate replacement, either through a similar facility or other sources of capital, would have a material and adverse impact on our ability to continue our business operations.\nOur future revenue, operating income, and cash flows are dependent on consumer preference and our ability to successfully execute our plan.\nOur company\u2019s future revenue and operating income will depend upon various factors, including continued and additional market acceptance of the BBQ Holdings brands and new operating platforms, the quality of our restaurant operations, our ability to grow our brands, our ability to successfully expand into new and existing markets, our ability to successfully execute our franchise program, our ability to raise additional financing as needed, discretionary consumer spending, the overall success of the venues where BBQ Holdings restaurants are or will be located, economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, general economic conditions and the continued popularity of the BBQ Holdings brands. An adverse change in any or all of these conditions would have a negative effect on our operations and the market value of our Common Stock.\nWe may choose not to open any more Company-owned restaurants and anticipate that most future restaurant growth will be through our franchisees. There is no guarantee that any of these franchise-operated restaurants will open when planned, or at all, due to many factors that may affect the development and construction of our restaurants, including landlord delays, weather interference, unforeseen engineering problems, environmental problems, construction or zoning problems, local government regulations, modifications in design to the size and scope of the project, and other unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays and cost overruns. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our growth plan for our Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants. In addition, we also face all of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the development of an expanding business.\nOur failure to execute our franchise program may negatively impact our revenue, operating income and cash flows.\nOur growth and success depend in part upon increasing the number of our franchised restaurants through execution of area development and franchise agreements with new and existing franchisees in new and existing markets. Our ability to successfully franchise additional restaurants or re-franchise existing Company-owned restaurants will depend on various factors, including our ability to attract, contract with and retain quality franchisees, the availability of suitable sites, the negotiation of acceptable leases or purchase terms for new locations, the negotiation of acceptable terms for the re-franchising of existing Company-owned restaurants, permitting and regulatory compliance, the ability to meet construction schedules, the financial and other capabilities of our franchisees, our ability to manage this anticipated expansion and general economic and business conditions. We may also be subject to additional impairment charges, lease termination and other charges, and increased financial statement disclosure requirements. Many of the foregoing factors are beyond our control or the control of our franchisees and there can be no assurance that we will be able to\nsuccessfully carry out our franchising and refranchising strategy on terms acceptable to our management and Board, or at all.\nOur growth and success also depend upon the ability of our franchisees to operate their restaurants successfully to our standards and promote the BBQ Holdings brands. Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees, and our franchise agreements include certain operating standards, each franchisee operates its restaurant independently. Various laws limit our ability to influence the day-to-day operation of our franchise restaurants. We cannot assure you that our franchisees will be able to successfully operate BBQ Holdings restaurants in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards, which could reduce their sales and, correspondingly, our franchise royalties, and could adversely affect our revenue, operating income and cash flows, and our ability to leverage the BBQ Holdings brands. In addition, there can be no assurance that our franchisees will have access to financial resources necessary to open the restaurants required by their respective area development agreements, which would negatively impact our growth plans.\nWe are subject to risks associated with long-term non-cancellable leases and the costs of exiting leases at restaurants we have closed or may close in the future may be greater than we estimate or could be greater than the funds we raise to address closure costs.\nPayments under our operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and we expect the new restaurants we open in the future will similarly be leased. Our leases generally have an initial term of 5 to 20 years and generally can be extended only in five-year increments (at increased rates). All of our leases require a fixed annual rent, although some require the payment of additional rent if restaurant sales exceed a negotiated amount. Generally, our leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. In connection with closing restaurants, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to pay increased occupancy costs or to close restaurants in desirable locations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have effected, and may continue to effect, acquisitions of and joint ventures with additional brands. Failure to find suitable candidates or successfully integrate any such brands could negatively impact our future growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired, and entered into joint ventures with, new brands. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition and joint venture candidates at acceptable prices, and we may not be able to complete these acquisitions.\nAdditionally, we may experience difficulties in integrating new brands, including coordinating and consolidating geographically separated systems and facilities, retraining and integrating the management and personnel of the acquired brands, combining financial accounting and reporting systems, establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and implementing operational procedures and disciplines to control costs and increase profitability. We may also be required to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nDevelopment initiatives outside our core business could result in adverse consequences.\nOur business expansion into non-traditional restaurant formats, including restaurants with a smaller footprint, restaurants located in non-traditional locations and restaurants that operate on a delivery-only and/or ghost kitchen basis, could create new operating and reputational risks.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our international footprint.\nOur current franchise program includes one restaurant in Manitoba, Canada, and six restaurants in the United Arab Emirates. Because there are a very limited number of international restaurants, we may not be completely aware of the development efforts involved and barriers to entry into new foreign markets. As a result, we may incur more expenses than originally anticipated and there is a risk that we may not be successful in expanding internationally. If we are successful in maintaining or expanding our international footprint, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors affecting international operations including, among others, regulatory, social, political or economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements, government spending patterns and changes in the laws and policies. Furthermore, by maintaining or expanding our international footprint, our brand value could be harmed by factors outside of our control, including, among other things, difficulties in achieving the consistency of product quality and service compared to our U.S. restaurants and an inability to obtain adequate and reliable supplies of ingredients and products.\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws and income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nIncreases in income tax rates in the United States or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Due tax law changes in December 2017, net interest expense deductions are limited to 30% of adjusted taxable income and the net operating loss deduction is limited to 80% of taxable income. With the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES\u201d) legislation, the net interest expense limitation increased from 30% to 50% for 2019 and 2020. If we fail to generate significant taxable income, we may not be able to fully deduct the interest expense on our debt, which could result in us having to pay increased federal income taxes. We have also generated substantial taxable losses in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Although the treatment of tax losses generated before December 31, 2017 has not changed, subsequent tax losses generated will only be able to offset 80% of taxable income, although the losses may be carried forward indefinitely. As such, we may have to pay federal income taxes in the future despite having significant net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.\nOur ability to exploit our brand depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, and if any third parties make unauthorized use of our intellectual property, our competitive position and business could suffer.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other intellectual proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. Accordingly, we have registered various trademarks and make use of various unregistered marks. However, the actions we have taken or may take in the future to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual proprietary rights may be inadequate to prevent others from imitating our products and concept or claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights by us. Although we intend to defend against any improper use of our marks to the fullest extent allowable by law, litigation related to such defense, regardless of the merit or resolution, may be costly and time consuming and divert the efforts and attention of our management.\nOur financial performance is affected by our ability to contract with reliable suppliers and food service distributors at competitive prices.\nIn order to maximize operating efficiencies, we have entered into arrangements with food manufacturers and distributors pursuant to which we obtain approximately 90% of the products used by our company, including, but not limited to, pork, poultry, beef and seafood. Although we may be able to obtain competitive products and prices from alternative suppliers, an interruption in the supply of products delivered by our food suppliers could adversely affect our operations in the short term. Due to the rising market price environment, our food costs may increase without the desire and/or ability to pass that price increase to our customers.\nOur suppliers have been disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, restrictions on employees\u2019 ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Furthermore, an extended duration of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant disruptions in our supply chain. For example, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, travel\nrestrictions and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could impact the availability or productivity of personnel at suppliers, distributors, freight carriers and other necessary components of our supply chain. These events could materially and adversely affect our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nAlthough we do contract for utilities in all available states, the costs of these energy-related items will fluctuate due to factors that may not be predictable, such as the economy, current political/international relations and weather conditions. Because we cannot control these types of factors, there is a risk that prices of energy/utility items will increase beyond our current projections and adversely affect our operations.\nIf there is a lack of sufficient labor or labor costs increase, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, because of increased competition for employees, a decrease in the labor supply to us or our key suppliers due to changes in immigration policy including barriers to immigrants entering, working in, or remaining in the United States, higher employee-turnover rates, unionization of restaurant workers, or changes in federal, state, or local laws, including those related to prevailing wages or in other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers' compensation insurance), this could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase. Potential changes in labor laws could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs.\nWe could be adversely impacted if our information technology and computer systems do not perform properly or if we fail to protect our customers\u2019 credit card information or our employees\u2019 personal data.\nWe rely heavily on information technology to conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants, online ordering and delivery, management of our supply chain, collection of cash and other receivables, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures, and any material failure or interruption of service could adversely affect our operations. Our ability to effectively and efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrades or the transition to replacement systems, inaccurate or fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations and negatively impact our business. Significant capital investment might be required to remediate any problems. In addition, we outsource certain essential technology-based business processes to third-party vendors and we may share sensitive financial and other information with third party vendors which subjects us to risks, including disruptions in business, increased costs and exposure to data breaches or privacy law compliance issues of our third-party vendors.\nRecently, retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been compromised, including several highly-publicized incidents. Although we take it very seriously and expend resources to ensure that our information technology operates securely and effectively, any security breaches could result in disruptions to operations or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our customers\u2019 consumer data or our team members\u2019 personal data are compromised, our operations could be adversely affected, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be subjected to litigation or the imposition of penalties and other remedial costs. In addition, as a franchisor, we are subject to additional reputation risk associated with data breaches that could occur at one of our franchise locations that could potentially harm the BBQ Holdings brand reputation.\nFailure to achieve our projected cost savings from our efficiency initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations and eliminate potential funding for growth opportunities.\nIn recent years, we have identified strategies and taken steps to reduce operating costs and free up resources to reinvest in our business. These strategies include supply chain efficiencies, reducing food waste, implementing labor\nscheduling tools and various information systems projects. We continue to evaluate and implement further cost-saving initiatives. However, the ability to reduce our operating costs through these initiatives is subject to risks and uncertainties, such as our ability to obtain improved supply pricing and the reliability of any new suppliers or technology, and we cannot assure you that these activities, or any other activities that we may undertake in the future, will achieve the desired cost savings and efficiencies. Failure to achieve such desired savings could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and curtail investment in growth opportunities.\nWe evaluate restaurant sites and long-lived assets for impairment and expenses recognized as a result of any impairment would negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nWe evaluate restaurant sites and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of restaurant sites to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant site to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis. If a restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant site exceeds its fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the best information available including estimated future cash flows, expected growth rates in comparable restaurant sales, remaining lease terms, discount rate and other factors. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to take additional impairment charges for the related assets, which would negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.\nChanges in consumer buying patterns, particularly e-commerce sites and off premise sales affect our revenues, operating results and liquidity.\nOur restaurants are primarily located near high consumer activity areas such as regional malls, lifestyle centers, \u201cbig box\u201d shopping centers and entertainment centers. We depend in large part on a high volume of visitors to these centers to attract customers to our restaurants. E-commerce or online shopping continues to increase and negatively impact consumer traffic at traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites located in regional malls, lifestyle centers, \u201cbig box\u201d shopping centers and entertainment centers. A decline in visitors to these centers near our restaurants may negatively affect our sales. Additionally, e-commerce or online shopping has caused some \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites to cease operations, and it may continue to cause future \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites to cease operations. These closures of traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites may lead to reduced customer traffic and a general deterioration in the surrounding retail centers in which our restaurants are located and may contribute to lower customer traffic at our restaurants.\nIn the last several years, off-premise sales, specifically delivery, have increased due to consumer demand for convenience. While we plan to continue to invest in the growth of our off-premise sales, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to increase our off-premise sales. Off-premise sales could also cannibalize dine in sales, or our systems and procedures may not be sufficient to handle off-premise sales, which require additional investments in technology or people. Additionally, a large percentage of delivery from our restaurants is through third-party delivery companies. These-third party delivery companies require us to pay them a commission, which lowers our profit margin on those sales; however, we believe that the majority of such sales are incremental. Any bad press, whether true or not, regarding third-party delivery companies or their business model may negatively impact our sales. If these third-party delivery companies cease doing business with us, or cannot make their scheduled deliveries, or do not continue their relationship with us on favorable terms, it will have a negative impact on sales or result in increased third-party delivery fees.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nLitigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters typically involve claims by consumers, employees and others regarding issues such as food borne illness, food safety, premises liability, \u201cdram shop\u201d statute liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, promotional advertising, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the\nfoodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nChallenging economic conditions may have a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nThe restaurant industry is affected by macro-economic factors, including changes in national, regional, and local economic conditions, employment levels and consumer spending patterns. Challenging economic conditions may negatively impact consumer spending and thus cause a decline in our financial results. For example, international, domestic and regional economic conditions, consumer income levels, financial market volatility, social unrest, governmental, political and budget matters, inflation and increased gasoline prices generally may have a negative effect on consumer confidence and discretionary spending. In recent years, we believe these factors and conditions have affected consumer traffic and comparable restaurant sales for us and throughout our industry and may continue to result in a challenging sales environment in the casual dining sector. A decline in economic conditions or negative developments with respect to any of the other factors mentioned above, generally or in particular markets in which we or our franchisees operate, and our guests\u2019 reactions to these trends could result in increased pressure with respect to our pricing, traffic levels, commodity and other costs and the continuation of our innovation and productivity initiatives, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. These factors could also cause us or our franchisees to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, impair the assets of or close restaurants as well as delay remodeling of existing restaurant locations. Further, poor economic conditions may force nearby businesses to shut down, which could cause our restaurant locations to be less attractive.\nCompetition may reduce our revenue, operating income, and cash flows.\nCompetition in the restaurant industry is intense. The restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer preferences, as well as by national, regional and local economic conditions, including real estate and demographic trends, traffic patterns, the cost and availability of qualified labor and product availability. Discretionary spending priorities, traffic patterns, tourist travel, weather conditions and the type, number and location of competing restaurants, among other factors, will also directly affect the performance of our restaurants. Changes in any of these factors in the markets where we currently operate our restaurants could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nIncreased competition by existing or future competitors may reduce our sales. Our restaurants compete with moderately-priced restaurants primarily on the basis of quality of food and service, atmosphere, location and value. We also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for quality sites.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Regional and national restaurant companies continue to expand their operations into our current and anticipated market areas. We believe our ability to compete effectively depends on our ongoing ability to promote our brand and offer high quality food and hospitality in a distinctive and comfortable environment. If we are unable to respond, or unable to respond in a timely manner, to the various competitive factors affecting the restaurant industry, our revenue, operating income and cash flows, as well as our growth plans, could be adversely affected.\nWe compete directly and indirectly for customer traffic with national and regional casual dining restaurant chains, as well as independently-owned restaurants. In addition, we face competition for customer traffic from fast casual and quick-service restaurants, home delivery services, mobile food service, grocery stores and meal kits that are increasing the quality and variety of their food products in response to customer demand. This increased competition, coupled with an oversupply of restaurants, has driven casual dining industry comparable traffic declines in recent years. This backdrop has made it even more challenging to improve customer traffic. We believe that many consumers remain focused on value and if our competitors, many of whom have significantly greater resources to market aggressively to customers, are able to promote and deliver a higher degree of perceived value, our customer traffic could suffer.\nNew information or attitudes regarding diet, health and the consumption of alcoholic beverages may materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nRegulations and consumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. Such changes may include regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of the food and beverages we offer. For example, several municipalities and states have approved restrictions on the use of trans-fats by restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in any consumer health regulations and our ability to adapt our menu offerings to trends in food consumption. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it may materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. The risks and costs associated with nutritional disclosures on our menus may also impact our operations, particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of nutritional information obtained from third-party suppliers.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive government regulation that could negatively impact our business.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, and local government regulation by various government agencies, including state and local licensing, zoning, land use, construction and environmental regulations and various regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, disposal of refuse and waste products, public health, safety and fire standards, adjustments to tip credits, minimum wage requirements, working conditions, hiring and employment practices, workers\u2019 compensation and citizenship requirements. Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible. Due to the fact that we offer and sell franchises, we are also subject to federal regulation and certain state laws which govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and termination or non-renewal of a franchise. We may also be subject in certain states to \u201cdram-shop\u201d statutes, which provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. In addition, our operating results would be adversely affected in the event we fail to maintain our food and liquor licenses.\nAny change in the current status of such regulations, including an increase in team member benefits costs, any and all insurance rates, or other costs associated with team members, could substantially increase our compliance and labor costs. Because we pay many of our restaurant-level team members rates based on either the federal or the state minimum wage, increases in the minimum wage would lead to increased labor costs. As a franchisor, we may be party to complaints naming us as a joint employer of workers at our franchisees. Such complaints or similar complaints could result in legal proceedings against us, based on the actions of our franchisees. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. Furthermore, restaurant operating costs are affected by increases in unemployment tax rates and similar costs over which we have no control.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. There is a risk that consumers\u2019 dining preferences may be impacted by such menu labeling. If we elect to alter our recipes in response to such a change in dining preferences, doing so could increase our costs and/or change the flavor profile of our menu offerings which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws relating to information security and privacy. As a merchant and service provider of point-of-sale services, we are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard issued by the Payment Card Industry Council (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d).\nWe are subject to the risks associated with the food services industry, including the risk that incidents of food-borne illnesses or food tampering could damage our reputation and reduce our restaurant sales.\nOur industry is susceptible to the risk of food-borne illnesses. As with any restaurant operation, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food-borne illnesses. Furthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by third-party food suppliers and distributors outside of our control and/or multiple locations being affected rather than a single restaurant. New illnesses resistant to any precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise that could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Reports in the media or on social media of one or more instances of food-borne illness in one of our Company-owned restaurants, one of our franchise-operated restaurants or in one of our competitor\u2019s restaurants could negatively affect our restaurant sales, force the closure of some of our restaurants and conceivably have a national impact if highly publicized. This risk exists even if it were later determined that the illness had been wrongly attributed to the restaurant. Furthermore, other illnesses could adversely affect the supply of some of our food products and significantly increase our costs. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant negative publicity event could have an adverse impact on our business or our relationships with customers, partners and franchisees.\nOur business and reputation could be adversely affected by a negative publicity event resulting from any key stakeholder\u2019s statements and actions. If we were unable to rebuild the trust of our customers, franchisees, business partners and suppliers, and if further negative publicity continued, we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business. We could also experience additional claims or litigation as a consequence of those events.\nSignificant adverse weather conditions and other disasters or unforeseen events could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters and other unforeseen events, such as winter storms, severe temperatures, thunderstorms, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, terror attacks, war and widespread/pandemic illness, and the effects of such events on economic conditions and consumer spending patterns, could negatively impact our results of operations. Temporary and prolonged restaurant closures may occur and consumer traffic may decline due to the actual or perceived effects from these events. Severe winter weather conditions have impacted our customer traffic and results of operations in the past.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nMinnesota law and our Articles protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits, which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit.\nMinnesota law provides that our directors will not be liable to our company or to our shareholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors. Our Articles require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require our company to use its assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.\nPursuant to its authority to designate and issue shares of our stock as it deems appropriate, our board of directors may assign rights and privileges to currently undesignated shares which could adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders.\nOur authorized capital consists of 100,000,000 shares of capital stock. Our Board of Directors, without any action by the shareholders, may designate and issue shares in such classes or series (including classes or series of preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights. The rights of holders of preferred stock and other classes of common stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights granted to the current holders of our common stock. Our Board\u2019s ability to designate and issue such undesignated shares could impede or deter an unsolicited tender offer or takeover proposal. Further, the issuance of additional shares having preferential rights could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Minnesota law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, which regulates business combinations. Section 302A.673 generally prohibits any business combination by an issuing public corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, with an interested shareholder, which means any shareholder that purchases 10% or more of our voting shares within four years following the date the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved by a committee composed solely of one or more disinterested members of our Board before the date the person became an interested shareholder.\nWe are also subject to Section 302A.675 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, which generally prohibits an offeror from acquiring our shares within two years following the offeror's last purchase of our shares pursuant to a takeover offer with respect to that class, unless our shareholders may sell their shares to the offeror upon substantially equivalent terms as those provided in the earlier takeover offer. This provision does not apply if the share acquisition is approved by a committee of disinterested members of our Board before the purchase of any shares by the offeror pursuant to the earlier takeover offer.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 84203, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BBQ"}
