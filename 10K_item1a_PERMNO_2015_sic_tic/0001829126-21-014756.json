RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition\nWe currently have no operations, and investors, therefore, have no basis on which to evaluate the Company\u2019s future prospects.\nWe currently have no operations and will be reliant upon a merger with or acquisition of an operating business to commence operations and generate revenue. Because we have no operations and have not generated revenues, investors have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of locating and completing a business combination with a target business. We have no current arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete a business combination in a reasonable timeframe, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to complete a business combination as planned, we will never generate any operating revenues.\nWe may face difficulties or delays in our search for a business combination, and we may not have access to sufficient capital to consummate a business combination.\nWe may face difficulty identifying a viable business opportunity or negotiating or paying for any resulting business combination. Economic factors that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic downturn, as well as increased competition for acquisitions of operating entities that we expect to encounter as a result thereof, may hinder our efforts to locate and/or obtain a business that is suitable for our business goals at a price we can afford and on terms that will enable us to sufficiently grow our business to generate value to our shareholders. We have limited capital, and we may not be able to take advantage of any available business opportunities on favorable terms or at all due to the limited availability of capital. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to provide us with the necessary funds to successfully develop and implement our plan of operation or acquire a business we deem to be appropriate or necessary to accomplish our objectives, in which case we may be forced to terminate our business plan and your investment in the Company could become worthless.\nIf we are not successful in acquiring a new business and generating material revenues, investors will likely lose their investment.\nIf we are not successful in developing a viable business plan and acquiring a new business through which to implement it, our investors\u2019 entire investment in the Company could become worthless. Even if we are successful in combining with or acquiring the assets of an operating entity, we can provide no assurances that the Company will be able to generate significant revenue therefrom in the short-term or at all or that investors will derive a profit from their investment. If we are not successful, our investors will likely lose their entire investment.\nIf we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not become profitable.\nBusinesses, including development-stage companies such as ours and/or any operating business or businesses we may acquire, often grow rapidly and tend to have difficulty managing their growth. If we are able to acquire an operating business, we will likely need to expand our management team and other key personnel by recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees and/or consultants capable of providing the necessary support.\nWe cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully. Our failure to meet these challenges could cause us to lose money, and your investment could be lost.\nBecause we have limited capital, we may need to raise additional capital in the future by issuing debt or equity securities, the terms of which may dilute our current investors and/or reduce or limit their liquidation or other rights.\nWe may require additional capital to acquire a business. We may not be able to obtain additional capital when required. Future business development activities, as well as administrative expenses such as salaries, insurance, general overhead, legal and compliance expenses, and accounting expenses, will require a substantial amount of additional capital. The terms of securities we issue in future capital raising transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include liquidation preferences, superior voting rights, or the issuance of other derivative securities, which could have a further dilutive effect on or subordinate the rights of our current investors. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity securities will likely dilute the ownership percentage of our shareholders. Additionally, any debt securities we issue would likely create a liquidation preference superior to that of our current investors and, if convertible into shares of Common Stock, would also pose the risk of dilution.\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary financing if and when required.\nOur ability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets (both in general and in the particular industry or industries in which we may choose to operate), our limited operating history, and current lack of operations, the national and global economies, and the condition of the market for microcap securities. Further, economic downturns such as the current global depression caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase our requirements for capital, particularly if such economic downturn persists for an extended period of time or after we have acquired an operating entity, and may limit or hinder our ability to obtain the funding we require. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with any revenues we may generate from future operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to discontinue our development or implementation of a business plan, cancel our search for business opportunities, cease our operations, divest our assets at unattractive prices or obtain financing on unattractive terms. If any of the foregoing should happen, our shareholders could lose some or all of their investment.\nBecause we are still developing our business plan, we do not have any agreement for a business combination.\nWe have no current arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a business combination with any specific entity. We may not be successful in identifying and evaluating a suitable acquisition candidate or in consummating a business combination. We are neutral as to what industry or segment for any target company. We have not established specific metrics and criteria we will look for in a target company, and if and when we do we may face difficulty reaching a mutual agreement with any such entity, including in light of market trends and forces beyond our control. Given our early-stage status, there is considerable uncertainty and therefore inherent risk to investors that we will not succeed in developing and implementing a viable business plan.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition, future plans and results of operations.\nThis COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse effect on the economy in the United States and on most businesses. The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business; however, if the pandemic and government action in response thereto impose limitations on our operations or result in a prolonged economic recession or depression, the Company\u2019s development and implementation of its business plan and our ability to commence and grow our operations, as well as our ability to generate material revenue therefrom, will be hindered, which would have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we are dependent upon Issamar Ginzberg, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director to manage and oversee our Company, the loss of him could adversely affect our plan and results of operations.\nWe currently have a sole director and officer, Issamar Ginzberg, who manages the Company and is presently evaluating a viable plan for our future operations. We will rely solely on his judgment in connection with selecting a target company and the terms and structure of any resulting business combination. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position. Further, because Mr. Ginzberg serves as Chief Executive Officer and sole director and also holds a controlling interest in the Company\u2019s Common Stock, our other shareholders will have limited ability to influence the Company\u2019s direction or management.\nIn addition, although not likely, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of a combination with their business. The departure of a target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and prospects of our post-combination business. The role of a target\u2019s key personnel upon the completion of the transaction cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain or all members of a target\u2019s management team may remain associated with the target following a change of control thereof, there can be no assurance that all of such target\u2019s management team will decide to remain in place. The loss of key personnel, either before or after a business combination and including management of either us or a combined entity could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business.\nRisks Related to a Potential Business Acquisition\nWe may encounter difficulty locating and consummating a business combination, including as a result of the competitive disadvantages we have.\nWe expect to face intense competition in our search for a revenue-producing business to combine with or acquire. Given the current economic climate, venture capital firms, larger companies, blank check companies such as special purpose acquisition companies and other investors are purchasing operating entities or the assets thereof in high volumes and at relatively discounted prices. These parties may have greater capital or human resources than we do and/or more experience in a particular industry within which we choose to search. Most of these competitors have a certain amount of liquid cash available to take advantage of favorable market conditions for prospective business purchaser such as those caused by the recent pandemic. Any delay or inability to locate, negotiate and enter into a business combination as a result of the relative illiquidity of our current asset or other disadvantages we have relative to our competitors could cause us to lose valuable business opportunities to our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may expend significant time and capital on a prospective business combination that is not ultimately consummated.\nThe investigation of each specific target business and any subsequent negotiation and drafting of related agreements, SEC disclosure and other documents will require substantial amounts of management\u2019s time and attention and material additional costs in connection with outsourced services from accountants, attorneys, and other professionals. We will likely expend significant time and resources searching for, conducting due diligence on, and negotiating transaction terms in connection with a proposed business combination that may not ultimately come to fruition. In such event, all of the time and capital resources expended by the Company in such a pursuit may be lost and unrecoverable by the Company or its shareholders. Unanticipated issues which may be beyond our control or that of the seller of the applicable business may arise that force us to terminate discussions with a target company, such as the target\u2019s failure or inability to provide adequate documentation to assist in our investigation, a party\u2019s failure to obtain required waivers or consents to consummate the transaction as required by the inability to obtain the required audits, applicable laws, charter documents and agreements, the appearance of a competitive bid from another prospective purchaser, or the seller\u2019s inability to maintain its operations for a sufficient time to allow the transaction to close. Such risks are inherent in any search for a new business and investors should be aware of them before investing in an enterprise such as ours.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and our shareholders, directors, or management, which may have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination or favorable terms or generate revenue.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ginzberg, is not required to commit his full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating his time between managing the Company and other businesses in which he is or may be involved. We do not intend to have any employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. Mr. Ginzberg is not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours to our affairs, and he may engage in other business endeavors while he provides consulting services to the Company. If any of his other business affairs require him to devote substantial amounts of time to such matters, it could materially limit his ability to devote his time and attention to our business which could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination or generate revenue.\nIt is possible that we obtain an operating company in which a director or officer of the Company has an ownership interest in or that he or she is an officer, director, or employee of. If we do obtain any business affiliated with an officer or director, such business combination may be on terms other than what would be arrived at in an arms-length transaction. If any conflict of interest arises, it could adversely affect a business combination or subsequent operations of the Company, in which case our shareholders may see diminished value relative to what would have been available through a transaction with an independent third party.\nWe may engage in a business combination that causes tax consequences to us and our shareholders.\nFederal and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be a significant factor in considering any business combination that we may undertake. Under current federal law, such transactions may be subject to significant taxation to the buyer and its shareholders under applicable federal and state tax laws. While we intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to the extent practicable in accordance with our business objectives, there can be no assurance that any business combination we undertake will meet the statutory or regulatory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or similar favorable treatment or that the parties to such a transaction will obtain the tax treatment intended or expected upon a transfer of equity interests or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization, combination or similar transaction could result in the imposition of significant taxation, both at the federal and state levels, which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction, including our shareholders.\nIt is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded any opportunity to evaluate or approve a business combination.\nIt is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded the opportunity to evaluate and approve a proposed business combination. In most cases, business combinations do not require shareholder approval under applicable law, and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not afford our shareholders with the right to approve such a transaction. Further, Mr. Ginzberg, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, owns a substantial portion of our outstanding Common Stock. Accordingly, our shareholders will be relying almost exclusively on the judgement of our board of directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) and Chief Executive Officer and any persons on whom they may rely with respect to a potential business combination. In order to develop and implement our business plan, may in the future hire lawyers, accountants, technical experts, appraisers, or other consultants to assist with determining the Company\u2019s direction and consummating any transactions contemplated thereby. We may rely on such persons in making difficult decisions in connection with the Company\u2019s future business and prospects. The selection of any such persons will be made by our Board, and any expenses incurred or decisions made based on any of the foregoing could prove to be adverse to the Company in hindsight, the result of which could be diminished value to our shareholders.\nBecause our search for a business combination is not presently limited to a particular industry, sector or any specific target businesses, prospective investors will be unable to evaluate the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations until such time as they are identified and disclosed.\nWe are still determining the Company\u2019s business plan, and we may seek to complete a business combination with an operating entity in any number of industries or sectors. Because we have not yet entered into any letter of intent or agreement to acquire a particular business, prospective investors currently have no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, prospects or other metrics or qualities they deem appropriate in considering to invest in the Company. Further, if we complete a business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business we acquire. For example, if we acquire a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established operating history, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a new business or a development stage entity. Although our management intends to evaluate and weigh the merits and risks inherent in a particular target business and make a decision based on the Company and its shareholders\u2019 interests, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all the significant risks inherent in a target business, that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence or that we will ultimately acquire a viable business and generate material revenue therefrom. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to reduce the likelihood that those risks will adversely impact a target business or mitigate any harm to the Company caused thereby. Should we select a course of action, or fail to select a course of action, that ultimately exposes us to unknown or unidentified risks, our business will be harmed and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nPast performance by our management and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\nWhile our Chief Executive Officer has prior experience in advising businesses, his past performance, the performance of other entities or persons with which he is involved, or the performance of any other personnel we may retain in the future will not necessarily be an indication of either (i) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) the future operating results of the Company including with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of him or any other of our personnel or their affiliates\u2019 performance as indicative of our future performance or that an investment in us will be profitable. In addition, an investment in the Company is not an investment in any entities affiliated with our management or other personnel. While management intends to endeavor to locate a viable business opportunity and generate shareholder value, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in this endeavor.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors that are outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise.\nWe will consider a business combination outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive opportunity for the Company. Although management intends to endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risks, or that we will accurately determine the actual value of a prospective operating entity to acquire. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s ability to evaluate and make decisions on behalf of the Company may be limited, or we may make material expenditures on additional personnel or consultants to assist management in the Company\u2019s operations. Investors should be aware that the information contained herein regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise will not necessarily be relevant to an understanding of the business that we ultimately elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risks or strategic opportunities that may arise. Accordingly, any shareholders in the Company following a business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares, and any resulting loss will likely not be recoverable.\nWe may attempt to complete a business combination with a private target company about which little information is available, and such target entity may not generate revenue as expected or otherwise by compatible with us as expected.\nIn pursuing our search for a business to acquire, we will likely seek to complete a business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and the only information available to us prior to making a decision may be from documents and information provided directly to us by the target company in connection with the transaction. Such documents or information or the conclusions we draw therefrom could prove to be inaccurate or misleading. As such, we may be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential business combination based on limited, incomplete, or faulty information, which may result in our subsequent operations generating less revenue than expected, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to assess the management of a prospective target business may be limited and, as a result, we may acquire a target business whose management does not have the skills, qualifications, or abilities to enable a seamless transition, which could, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations.\nWhen evaluating the desirability of a potential business combination, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources, or information. Our management\u2019s assessment of the capabilities of the target\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities expected. Further, in most cases the target\u2019s management may be expected to want to manage us and replace our Chief Executive Officer. Should the target\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to manage a public company or assist with their former entity\u2019s merger or combination into ours, the operations and profitability of the post-acquisition business may be negatively impacted and our shareholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares.\nAny business we acquire will likely lack diversity of operations or geographical reach, and in such case we will be subject to risks associated with dependence on a single industry or region.\nOur search for a business will likely be focused on entities with a single or limited business activity and/or that operate in a limited geographic area. While larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversifying their operations among different industries and regions, smaller companies such as ours and the entities we anticipate reviewing for a potential business combination generally lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of their business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by risks affecting the industry or the region in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified. In addition to general economic risks, we could be exposed to natural disasters, civil unrest, technological advances, and other uncontrollable developments that will threaten our viability if and to the extent our future operations are limited to a single industry or region. If we do not diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations will be at risk.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to us, may adversely affect our business, ability to negotiate and complete a business combination, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by federal, state, and local governments. In addition to SEC regulations, any business we acquire in the future may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory oversight and restrictions, which could hinder our growth and expend material amounts on compliance. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application by courts and administrative judges may also change from time to time, and any such changes could be unfavorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments, and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could result in material defense or remedial costs and/or damages have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nDue to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile.\nThere is currently a limited market for our Common Stock, and there can be no guarantee that an active market for our Common Stock will develop, even if we are successful in consummating a business combination. Recently, the price of our Common Stock has been volatile for no reason. Further, even if an active market for our Common Stock develops, it will likely be subject to by significant price volatility when compared to more seasoned issuers. We expect that the price of our Common Stock will continue to be more volatile than more seasoned issuers for the foreseeable future. Fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock can be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this Report, including:\n\u25cf General speculative fever;\n\u25cf A prospective business combination and the terms and conditions thereof;\n\u25cf The operating performance of any business we acquire, including any failure to achieve material revenues therefrom;\n\u25cf The performance of our competitors in the marketplace, both pre- and post-combination;\n\u25cf The public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, SEC filings, website content and other public announcements and information;\n\u25cf Changes in earnings estimates of any business that we acquire or recommendations by any research analysts who may follow us or other companies in the industry of a business that we acquire;\n\u25cf Variations in general economic conditions, including as may be caused by uncontrollable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting decline in the economy;\n\u25cf The public disclosure of the terms of any financing we disclose in the future;\n\u25cf The number of shares of our Common Stock that are publicly traded in the future;\n\u25cf Actions of our existing shareholders, including sales of Common Stock by our then directors and then executive officers or by significant investors; and\n\u25cf The employment or termination of key personnel.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of whether we can consummate a business combination and of our current or subsequent operating performance and financial condition. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business.\nBecause trading in our Common Stock is so limited, investors who purchase our Common Stock may depress the market if they sell Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock trades on the OTC Pink Market, the successor to the pink sheets. The OTC Pink Market generally is illiquid and most stocks traded there are of companies that are not required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Our Common Stock itself infrequently trades.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may decline if a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock are sold at once or in large blocks.\nPresently the market for our Common Stock is limited. If an active market for our shares develops in the future, some or all of our shareholders may sell their shares of our Common Stock which may depress the market price. Any sale of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or the perception that such a sale could occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, which could reduce the value of the shares held by our other shareholders.\nFuture issuance of our Common Stock could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, particularly in connection with an acquisition and any resulting financing.\nWe may issue additional shares of our Common Stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of our Common Stock could substantially dilute the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of Common Stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in a business combination which received our Common Stock as consideration or by investors who has previously acquired such Common Stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nDue to recent changes to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our Common Stock may become subject to limitations or reductions on stock price, liquidity, or volume.\nOn September 16, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). This Rule applies to broker-dealers who quote securities listed on over-the-counter markets such as our Common Stock. The Rule as amended prohibits broker-dealers from publishing quotations on OTC markets for an issuer\u2019s securities unless they are based on current publicly available information about the issuer. When it becomes effective, the amended Rule will also limit the Rule\u2019s \u201cpiggyback\u201d exception, which allows broker-dealers to publish quotations for a security in reliance on the quotations of a broker-dealer that initially performed the information review required by the Rule, to issuers with current publicly available information or issuers that are up-to-date in their Exchange Act reports. As of this date, we are uncertain as what actual effect the Rule may have on us.\nThe Rule changes could harm the liquidity and/or market price of our Common Stock by either preventing our shares from being quoted or driving up our costs of compliance. Because we are a voluntary filer under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and not a public reporting company, the practical impact of these changes is to require us to maintain a level of periodic disclosure we are not presently required to maintain, which would cause us to incur material additional expenses. Further, if we cannot or do not provide or maintain current public information about our company, our stockholders may face difficulties in selling their shares of our Common Stock at desired prices, quantities, or times, or at all, as a result of the amendments to the Rule.", "PERMNO": 12014, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CBPI"}
