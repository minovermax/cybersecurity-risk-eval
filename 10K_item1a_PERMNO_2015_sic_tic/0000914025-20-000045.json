RISK FACTORS\nYOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT WE ARE NOT PRESENTLY AWARE OF OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE ARE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY ANY OR ALL OF THESE RISKS. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. IN ASSESSING THESE RISKS, YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES.\n1. The recent global COVID-19 outbreak has harmed and could continue to harm our business and results of operations.\nThe novel strain of COVID-19 identified in late 2019 has spread globally, including within the United States, and has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. This outbreak has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and financial markets and has impacted, and will further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our end-customers, and those of our respective channel partners, vendors and suppliers. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of this virus and various government restrictions and guidelines, we have taken measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize the risk to our employees, channel partners, end-customers, and the communities in which we operate. These measures include transitioning our in-office employee population to work remotely from home and looking for alternative and/or dual sourcing options. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies and practices as more information and public health guidance become available, the precautionary measures that we have adopted could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, and create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, COVID-19 may disrupt the operations of our end-customers and channel partners for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows.\nThe impact of COVID-19 is fluid and uncertain, and it has caused, and may continue to cause, various negative effects, including difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for our products, shortages of labor to manufacture products, and temporary closures of the facilities of some of our suppliers, customers and our own production facilities; our inability to meet with our actual or potential customers or channel partners; our customers or channel partners deciding to delay or abandon their planned purchases; and our ability to meet production demands for our product lines. As a result, we may experience extended sales cycles; our demand generation activities, and our ability to close transactions with new and existing end-customers and partners may be negatively impacted. Although the Company continues to work with its supply chain and dual source partners to take the necessary steps to mitigate disruption of supply, there can be no assurance that the ongoing disruptions due to COVID-19 will be resolved in the near term. Further it has been and, until the COVID-19 outbreak is contained and global economic activity stabilizes, will continue to be more difficult for us to forecast our operating results as economic uncertainty puts further pressure on management judgments used to develop forward looking financial guidance and other prospective financial information.\nMore generally, COVID-19 has not only significantly and adversely increased economic and demand uncertainty, it has caused a global economic slowdown, which may decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations. Although the ultimate severity of the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain at this time, the pandemic has had, and will continue to have, adverse impacts on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company has experienced temporary disruptions in its supply chain and may continue to experience such disruptions as the outbreak has impacted sourcing of key component parts, and manufacturing and distribution networks throughout the world, including our own facility in Mexico, which shut down for approximately two weeks. The receipt of products or raw material sourced from impacted areas has been, and will continue to be, slowed or disrupted in the coming months, which could impact the manufacture and sale of our products to our channel partners and/or in turn their fulfillment to end-user customers.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply its significant accounting policies. The Company has assessed various accounting estimates and other matters, including those that require consideration of forecasted financial information, in context to the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 using information that is reasonably available at this time. The accounting estimates and other matters the Company has assessed include, but were not limited to, goodwill and other long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation allowances for tax assets, inventory and related reserves, and revenue recognition. As COVID-19 continues to develop, the Company may make changes to these estimates and judgments, which could result in meaningful impacts to its financial statements in future periods. In addition, judgments related to accounting estimates may require additional or different methods of evaluation. If complexity of the judgments increases, the Company may require changes in its internal controls over financial reporting. The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and\ndifficult to predict, as the response to the pandemic is in its incipient stages and information is rapidly evolving. As COVID-19 has impacted various regions in the world differently, we may in the future experience further business operation disruptions. Additionally, if a significant number of our workforce employed in any of our contract or our own manufacturing facilities or in our offices were to contract the virus, we may experience delays or the inability to develop, produce and deliver our products on a timely basis. Additionally, significant and abrupt changes in product supply and demand increases the complexity of management\u2019s evaluation of potential excess or obsolete inventory.\nAdditionally, our end-user customers and channel partners suffer from their own economic challenges. If global or regional economic conditions deteriorate further, whether in general or in specific markets, customers and/or partners may demand pricing accommodations, delay payments, delay or curtail prior deployment plans, or become insolvent. It is impossible to reliably determine if and to what extent our customers and/or partners may suffer, whether we will be required to adjust our prices or face collection issues and/or credit losses with customers and/or partners or if customer and/or partner bankruptcies will occur.\nIt is not possible at this time to foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 or other events beyond our control will be effectively contained, nor can we estimate the entirety of the impact that COVID-19 or such other pandemics or natural or manmade disaster will have on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners. As such, impacts from such events to the Company are highly uncertain and the Company will continue to assess the financial effects.\nDisruptions in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak also may adversely affect the Company if these impacts continue for a prolonged period and the Company needs additional liquidity. To further preserve financial flexibility, the Company\u2019s board of directors authorized the suspension of the quarterly dividend which the Company expects to utilize for de-leveraging and strengthening the balance sheet. For more detail, see risk factor \"We cannot guarantee we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs or that we will pay dividends at historic rates or at all. The repurchase of our common stock and the payment of dividends may require us to borrow against our credit agreement or incur indebtedness and may not achieve our objectives.\"\n2. We face risks related to COVID-19 related to our manufacturing facility in Mexico, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\nDisruptive activities from COVID-19 has caused, and may in the future cause, temporary closure of our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico, which may impair our ability to continue production at the capacity necessary to timely supply the number of products to fulfill current and future customer demand and ship our products worldwide. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations at this facility remains highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If workers become ill or are quarantined and are therefore unable to work, our operations could be subject to significant disruption. Further, we may incur higher supply costs in sourcing products from alternative manufacturers/suppliers. Such manufacturers/suppliers may be unable to produce and supply the products needed or may be required to reduce production levels, either of which may negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n3. The failure to successfully integrate the business and operations of Polycom in the expected time frame and achieve the expected synergies and may result in significant expenses and accounting charges that may adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nWe believe the Acquisition of Polycom, which was completed on July 2, 2018, will result in certain benefits, including acceleration and expansion of our market opportunities, creation of a broad portfolio of communications and collaboration endpoints, significant expansion of services offerings, accretion to diluted earnings per common share, and significant operational efficiencies and cost synergies. However, our ability to realize these anticipated benefits depends on the successful integration of the two businesses. The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to integrate the businesses in a timely and cost-efficient manner or do so without adversely impacting revenue, operations, including new product launches and cash flows;\n\u2022\nexpected synergies or operating efficiencies may fail to materialize in whole or part, or may not occur within expected time-frames;\n\u2022\nthat goodwill recorded at the time of the Acquisition has been and may in the future be further materially impaired (see Risk Factor: \"Impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill have resulted in charges that adversely impact our financial results\");\n\u2022\nthe failure to successfully manage relationships with each company\u2019s historic customers, resellers, end-users, suppliers and strategic partners and their operating results and businesses generally (including the diversion of management time to react to new and unforeseen issues);\n\u2022\nthe failure to appropriately assess optimal on hand, finished goods, order management and channel inventory levels to optimize supply chain and order fulfillment systems;\n\u2022\nthe failure or inability to timely and efficiently integrate network infrastructures including pricing and ordering systems without materially adversely impacting the timing and processing of orders which could harm our relationships with suppliers, vendors, customers and end users;\n\u2022\nthe failure to accurately estimate the potential markets and market shares for the combined company\u2019s products, the nature and extent of competitive responses to the Acquisition and the ability of the combined company to achieve or exceed projected market growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract key personnel or to retain key personnel with unique talents, expertise or background knowledge as a consequence of both voluntary and involuntary employment actions;\n\u2022\nthe failure to successfully advocate the benefits of the combined company for existing and potential end-users, customers, and resellers or general uncertainty regarding the value proposition of the combined entity or its products;\n\u2022\nthe failure to effectively compete against larger companies or companies with well-established market shares in the broader markets expected to be served by the combined company or the perceived threat by competitors that the combined company represents to their existing markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties forecasting financial results;\n\u2022\noutcomes or rulings in known or as yet to be discovered regulatory enforcement, litigation or other similar matters that are, alone or in the aggregate, materially adverse;\n\u2022\nnegative effects on the market price of our common stock as a result of the transaction, particularly in light of the amount of debt incurred, our ability to timely pay down such debt, restrictions placed on our operations as result of covenants related to the debt, as well as the number of shares of our stock issued in the transaction and any subsequent sales of that stock by the seller, and forecasts and expectations of analysts;\n\u2022\nfailures in our financial reporting including those resulting from system implementations in the context of the integration, our ability to report or forecast financial results of the combined company and our inability to successfully discover and assess and integrate into our reporting system, any of which may adversely impact our ability to make timely and accurate filings with the SEC and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating professional services revenue streams with historic hardware sales and subscription services without adversely impacting revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nthe potential impact of the transaction on our future tax rate and payments based on our global entity consolidation efforts and our ability to quickly and cost effectively integrate foreign operations;\n\u2022\nthe challenges of integrating the supply chains of the two companies; and\n\u2022\nthe potential that our due diligence did not fully uncover the risks and potential liabilities of Polycom.\nThe actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays, distract management from other revenue or acquisition opportunities, and increase the combined company\u2019s expenses and working capital requirements, particularly in the short-term. If we are unable to successfully integrate Polycom's business and operations in a timely manner, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be fully realized, or at all, or may take longer to realize than anticipated. Should any of the foregoing or other currently unanticipated risks arise, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted.\nIn addition, our financial results may be adversely affected by the resulting accounting charges incurred thereby and we expect to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of the companies, which may be substantial. Additional costs may include: costs of employee redeployment; accelerated amortization of deferred equity compensation and severance payments; reorganization or closure of facilities; taxes; advisor and professional fees; and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services. We may be required to account for these costs as expenses that decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made. For example, for the fiscal year ended March 28, 2020, we recorded $38.3 million integration costs, which consisted primarily of costs for consulting services and other professional fees. The price of our common stock could decline to the extent our financial results are materially or unexpectedly affected by the foregoing charges and costs, or if future charges and costs are larger than anticipated.\n4. Impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill have resulted in charges that adversely impact our financial results.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of March 28, 2020. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis and measurement requires significant judgment on the part of management and may be impacted by a wide variety of factors, both within and beyond our control. We are required to annually test goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred, either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Additionally, interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. Factors that may be considered when determining if the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization.\nIn March 2020, we identified a triggering event which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $180 million relating to the Company\u2019s intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment related to long-lived assets in the voice asset group, as well as a\nnon-cash impairment charge of $484 million to goodwill due to an overall decline in the Company\u2019s earnings and sustained decrease in our stock price. If the factors triggering the impairment noted herein continue or worsen due to COVID-19 and other factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, the Company may experience a further negative impact on its financial results as well as risks associated with our design and operation of internal controls.\n5. Adverse or uncertain global and regional economic conditions may negatively affect us.\nOur business and financial performance is subject to changes in macroeconomic and global conditions. Economic concerns, such as uncertain or inconsistent global or regional economic growth, stagnation or contraction, including the pace of economic growth in the United States and around the world, as well as actual or potential political unrest, natural disasters, armed conflict, and public health outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed above, may cause companies and governments to delay, reduce or cancel spending, increasing the uncertainty and predictability of our business with companies and governmental agencies. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, has resulted and could continue to result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate. A global economic downturn, changes in the industries in which we sell our products, or erratic or declining business or governmental spending or hiring have in the past and may again in the future reduce sales of our products, increase sales cycles, slow adoption of new technologies, increase price competition, and cause customers and suppliers to default on their financial obligations. Uncertainty regarding future economic conditions and the markets into which we sell make it challenging both in the near and long-term to forecast operating results, make business decisions, and identify risks that may affect our business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, to the extent governments implement general or specific reductions in spending, demand for our products by those governmental agencies subject to the measures and by customers who derive all or a portion of their revenues from these agencies, may decline. Similarly, to the extent uncertainty regarding public debt limits or governmental budgets hinder spending by retail consumers, businesses or governmental agencies, sales of our products may be materially harmed or delayed.\n6. Our failure to effectively enhance and develop our sales strategy and sales force, may harm our revenues and financial outcomes as a result.\nThe Company is substantially dependent on our sales force to effectively execute our sales, pricing and business strategies, to obtain new channel partners, and to drive additional opportunities with our existing channel partners. The Company believes that there is significant competition for skilled sales personnel with technical knowledge. Our ability to grow our business depends on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sales personnel to support the Company. We periodically adjust our sales organization and our compensation programs to optimize our sales operations, to increase revenue, and to support our business model. If we have not structured our sales organization or compensation for our sales personnel in a way that properly supports our Company\u2019s objectives, or if we fail to make changes in a timely fashion or do not effectively manage changes, the Company\u2019s performance could be adversely affected.\n7. Competition in each of our markets is strong, and our inability to compete effectively could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition in all of the markets worldwide for our products, solutions and services. Market leadership changes may occur as a result of numerous factors, including new product and technology introductions, new market participants, pricing pressure on average selling prices and sales terms and conditions, and related to product performance and functionality. For a further description of our competitors and the markets in which we compete, see Item 1, Business, in this Form 10-K.\nOur competitive landscape continues to rapidly evolve as the industry moves into new markets for collaboration such as mobile, browser-based, and cloud-delivered collaboration offerings. Competitors in these markets also continue to develop and introduce new technologies, sometimes proprietary or closed architectures, that may block or limit our ability to compete in certain markets. Many of our competitors are larger, offer broader product lines, may integrate their products and solutions with communications solutions, devices, and adapters manufactured or provided by them or others, offer products or solutions incompatible with our products, have established market positions, and have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources; all of which may increase pressure to reduce our pricing, increase our spending on sales and marketing, or both, which would correspondingly have a negative impact on our revenues and operating margins.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved performance. New product introductions by our current or future competitors, or our delay in bringing new products to market, could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products. We believe that ongoing competitive pressure may result in a reduction in the prices of our products and our competitors\u2019 products. In addition, the introduction of additional lower priced competitive products or of new products or product platforms could render our existing products or technologies\nobsolete. We also believe we will face increasing competition from alternative UC&C endpoint solutions that employ new technologies or new combinations of technologies.\nSimplification of certain product technology is leading to the availability of alternative, lower cost competitive products targeted to enterprises, consumers and small businesses, which could harm sales. If we do not distinguish our products, through distinctive, technologically advanced features and designs, as well as continue to build and strengthen our brand recognition, our products may become more difficult to sell or to sell at the desired prices and financial margins. In addition, failure to effectively market our products could lead to lower and more volatile revenue and earnings, excess inventory, and the inability to recover associated development costs, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe also face competition from companies, principally located in or originating from Asia, offering low cost products, including products modeled on, direct copies of, or counterfeits of our products. Online marketplaces make it easier for disreputable and fraudulent sellers to introduce their copies or counterfeit products into the stream of commerce by commingling legitimate products with copies and counterfeits; thereby making it extremely difficult to track and remove copies and counterfeits. The introduction of low-cost alternatives, copies and counterfeits has resulted in and will continue to cause market pricing pressure, customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation and brand name. If product prices are substantially reduced by new or existing market participants, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially negatively affected.\n8. Increased consolidation and the formation of strategic partnerships in our industry may lead to increased competition, which could negatively impact our business and future results of operations.\nStrategic partnerships and acquisitions are being formed and announced by our competitors on a regular basis, which increases competition and can result in increased downward pressure on our product prices. As a result, competition with larger combined companies with significantly greater financial, sales and marketing resources, a larger channel network and expanded product lines is a constant threat to our market share and revenues. Competitors can sell their communications solutions product lines in conjunction with proprietary network equipment or platform technology as a complete solution, making it more difficult to compete against them or to ascertain pricing on competitive products. In addition, some competitors may use their strengths in adjacent markets to foreclose competition in the UC&C solutions market. In some cases, proprietary solutions may also preclude our competitive products from being fully interoperable with our competitors' endpoints, infrastructure and/or network products. Acquisitions or partnerships made by one of our strategic partners could also limit the potential contribution of our strategic relationships to our business and restrict our ability to form strategic relationships with these companies in the future and, as a result, harm our business. Rumored or actual consolidation of our partners and competitors may cause uncertainty and disruption to our business and can cause our stock price to fluctuate.\n9. Our operating results are difficult to predict, they could fluctuate, and our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\nAll of the factors discussed in this section could affect our quarterly and annual operating results and our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Our operating quarterly and annual operating results have varied from period to period and may fluctuate in the future as a result of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which we may not foresee, or which we may foresee but not manage effectively, including changes in the economic environment, and the other factors identified below in this section. Our stock price is subject to speculation by analysts and in the press, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock, changes in or announcements regarding our forecasts and guidance, our credit ratings, market trends unrelated to our performance, and sales of our common stock by us, our officers or directors or unaffiliated third party investors, particularly considering the concentrated ownership of our common stock, that may limit the ability for investors to acquire or sell meaningful quantities of our stock or cause speculation as to the acquisition or sale of our stock. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our business.\nGiven the nature of the markets in which we compete, our revenues and profitability vary from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuating optimal inventory levels;\n\u2022\nvariations in the volume and timing of orders received during each quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute on our strategic and operating plans;\n\u2022\nshifts in the timing, size and types of products ordered, as well as the mix of products and services, and the geographic locations of the customers placing orders, any of which could impact gross margins depending on the various margins of the products and services ordered and foreign currency exchange rates on both revenues and expenses;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customers' sales promotions and campaigns or variations in sales rates by our channel partner customers to their customers;\n\u2022\nchanges to our channel partner programs, contracts, pricing and go to market strategies that could: (i) result in a reduction in the number of channel partners; (ii) adversely impact our revenues and gross margins as we realign our discount and rebate programs for our channels; or (iii) cause more of our channel partners to add our competitors\u2019 products to their portfolios;\n\u2022\nthe timing of large end customer deployments, including UC&C infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe timing and market acceptance of new product introductions by us and our competitors and obsolescence or discontinuance of existing products;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including pricing pressure, product features and functionality, by us, our competitors or our customers;\n\u2022\nthe level and mix of inventory that we hold to meet future demand;\n\u2022\nchanges to our global organization and retention of or changes in key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in effective tax rates which are difficult to predict due to, among other things, the timing and geographical mix of our earnings, the outcome of current or future tax audits and potential new rules and regulations;\n\u2022\nfailure to timely introduce new products within projected costs and reduce costs as production increases;\n\u2022\nchanges in technology and desired product features, including whether those changes occur as and when anticipated;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the U.S. and our international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncustomer cancellations and rescheduling;\n\u2022\nmisalignment between supply chain ordering and demand by customers and systems to forecast demand;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changing costs of freight and components used in the manufacturing of our products and the potential negative impact on our gross margins;\n\u2022\ninvestments in and the costs associated with strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\nchanges in the underlying factors and assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules or their interpretation; and\n\u2022\nother factors beyond our control, including popular uprisings, terrorism, war, natural disasters, and diseases, such as COVID-19.\nAs a result of these and potentially other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily a good predictor of our future performance. If our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market securities analysts or investors, or below any financial guidance we may provide to the market, our stock price may decline. Financial guidance beyond the current quarter is inherently subject to greater risk and uncertainty, and if the transitions in our markets accelerate, our ability to forecast becomes more difficult.\n10. We face risks related to our dependence on channel partners and strategic partners to sell our products.\nChanges to our channel partner programs or channel partner contracts may not be favorably received and as a result our channel partner relationships and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nOur channel partners are eligible to participate in various incentive programs, depending upon their contractual arrangements with us. As part of these arrangements, we have the right to make changes in our programs and launch new programs as business conditions warrant. Further, from time to time, we may make changes to our channel partner contracts or realign our discount and rebate programs. For instance, following the Acquisition of Polycom and partially as a consequence of the significant number of overlapping channel partners with inconsistent contractual terms between the two legacy Plantronics and Polycom entities, we embarked on a rationalization program designed to organize the channels serving our markets and harmonize the contractual terms under which we conduct business with these partners. These changes have disrupted our channel partners and may cause them to add competitive products to their portfolios, delay advertising or sales of our products, or shift their emphasis to selling our competitors\u2019 products. Our channel partners may not be receptive to future changes, and we may not receive the positive benefits that we anticipate in making any program and contractual changes.\nOur strategic partnerships with companies may not yield the desired results which could harm our business.\nWe are focusing on our strategic partnerships and alliances with traditional partners like Microsoft and new partners such as Zoom, Google and others. Defining, managing and developing these partnerships is expensive and time-consuming and may not yield the desired results, impacting our ability to effectively compete in the market and to take advantage of anticipated future market growth. Because our products are intended to perform across multiple platforms, certain of our channel partners and strategic alliance partners may perceive conflicts in our business placing one strategic alliance partner versus another.\nIn addition, as we enter into agreements with these strategic partners to enable us to continue to expand our relationships with these partners, we may undertake additional obligations, such as development efforts and product certifications to our partner\u2019s standards or requirements, which could trigger unintended penalty or other provisions in the event that we fail to fully perform our contractual commitments or could result in additional costs beyond those that are planned in order to meet these contractual\nobligations. We are reliant on certain strategic alliances to certify our products to work on their platform, which they withhold if we are unable to meet the time frames required, or if our competitors have certifications for competitive products for which we are not yet certified, our revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted.\nConflicts between our channel partners and strategic partners could arise which could harm our business.\nSome of our current and future products are directly competitive with the products sold by both our channel and strategic partners. As a result of these conflicts, there is the potential for our channel and strategic partners to compete head-to-head with us or to significantly reduce or eliminate their orders of our products or design our technology out of their products. Further, as a result of our increased efforts to sell through a direct sales model, we may alienate some of our channel partners or cause a shift in product sales from our traditional channel model. Due to these and other factors, channel conflicts could arise which cause channel partners to devote resources to the communications equipment of competitors, which would negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our products are reliant on strategic partnerships with call management providers and wireless UC&C platform providers. These partnerships result in interoperable features between products to deliver a total solution to our mutual end-user customers. Competition with our partners in all of the markets in which we operate is likely to increase, which would adversely affect our revenues and could potentially strain our existing relationships with these companies.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our channel partners\u2019 sales reporting, product inventories and product sell-through.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to channel partners who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to resellers and end-users. Our revenue forecasts associated with products stocked by some of our channel partners are based largely on point of sale information regarding their sales to resellers and end users that our channel partners provide to us. To the extent that this sales-out and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received timely, our revenue forecasts for future periods may be less reliable. Further, if these channel partners are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter or if channel partners decide to decrease their inventories for any reason, such as a recurrence of global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending, the volume of our sales to these channel partners and our revenues could be negatively affected. In addition, we also face the risk that some of our channel partners have inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales. If such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these channel partners for any reason, these channel partners may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods, or product returns may exceed historical or predicted levels, which would harm our business and create unexpected variations in our financial results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the success of the businesses of our channel partners.\nSome of our channel partners that carry our products, and from whom we derive significant revenues, are thinly capitalized. Although we perform ongoing evaluations of their creditworthiness, the failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability, obtain financing or adequately fund capital expenditures could have a significant negative effect on our future revenue levels and profitability and our ability to collect our receivables. In addition, global economic uncertainty, including uncertainty created by the impact of COVID-19. reductions in technology spending in the United States and other countries, and periodic ongoing challenges in the financial services industry have in the past restricted, and may again in the future restrict, the availability of capital, which may delay collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy, jeopardizing the collectability of our receivables from such channel partners and negatively impacting our future results.\nOur channel partner contracts are typically short-term and early termination of these contracts may harm our results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain as to future order levels from our channel partners. In the event of a termination of one of our major channel partners, we believe that the end-user customer would likely purchase from another one of our channel partners, but if this did not occur and we were unable to rapidly replace that revenue source, its loss would harm our results of operations.\nOur channel partners are impacted by changes in customer purchasing preferences which may negatively impact our traditional sales channels or the prices at which we may sell our products.\nIt is becoming easier for small online sellers of certain product categories to enter the market unburdened with physical locations, employees and support personnel which can force our larger traditional brick and mortar resellers to reduce their selling prices. In turn, our traditional resellers may demand lower selling prices from us, more cooperative and marketing incentives, reduce their sales support needed to maintain our premium brand image, discontinue carrying our products and other similar adverse actions. As we expand our service offerings, many of our historical channel partners may be unwilling or unable to market our services forcing us to establish new or different relationships. Further, increased competition among resellers may cause some of our resellers and partners to experience financial difficulties or force them to shut down, decreasing our channels to market. The inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors, OEMs, retailers, and telephony service providers or to maintain quality distribution channels and sales models could negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf our channel partners fail to comply with laws or standards, our business could be harmed.\nWe expect our channel partners to meet certain standards of conduct and to comply with applicable laws, such as global anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and import and export control laws. Noncompliance with standards or laws could harm our reputation and could result in fines, penalties, injunctions, or other harm to our business and results of operations were we to become involved in an investigation due to non-compliance by a channel partner.\n11. If we fail to accurately forecast demand we may under or overestimate production requirements resulting in lost business or write offs of excess inventory which may materially harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short-term customer commitments, decreasing product life cycles, and changes in demand. Production levels are generally forecasted based on customer forecasts and historic product demand and we often place orders with suppliers for materials, components and sub-assemblies (\u201cmaterials and components\u201d) as well as finished products many weeks in advance of projected customer orders. Actual customer demand depends on many factors and may vary significantly from forecasts. We may lose opportunities to increase revenues and profits and may incur increased costs and penalties including expedited shipping fees and late delivery penalties if we underestimate customer demand.\nConversely, overestimating demand may result in higher inventories of materials and components and finished products, which may later require us to write off all or a material portion of our inventories. We routinely review inventory for usage potential, including fulfillment of customer warranty obligations and spare part requirements, and we write down to the lower of cost or market value the excess and obsolete inventory, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nFor instance, periodically, we or our competitors announce new products, capabilities, or technologies that replace or shorten the life cycles of legacy products or cause customers to defer or stop purchasing legacy products until new products become available. Additionally, new product announcements may incite customers to increase purchases of successful legacy products as part of a last-time buy strategy, thereby increasing sales in the short-term while decreasing future sales and delaying new product adoption. These risks increase the difficulty of accurately forecasting demand for discontinued and new products as well as the likelihood of inventory obsolescence, loss of revenue and associated gross profit. If any of the above occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\n12. We have a number of large customers with substantial market power whose ability to demand pricing and promotion concessions as well as other unfavorable terms makes sales forecasting difficult which can harm our profitability.\nMany customers with whom we conduct business are quite large with substantial buying power or who have strategic importance to our product marketing objectives. Many use their buying power or strategic importance to mandate terms and conditions favorable to them to conduct business, including unfavorable payment terms. If our compliance with these or similar future provisions are incorrect or inadequate, we could be liable for breach of contract damages or our reputation with one or more key customers could be harmed, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n13. Business interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition to the impact of COVID-19 discussed above, other factors or events outside of our control including, without limitation, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters, or other business interruptions, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused or could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, us, and our suppliers or customers. Our major business operations and those of many of our vendors and their sub-suppliers are subject to interruption by disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes,\nfloods, and volcanic eruptions or other natural or manmade disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, public health issues, flu or similar epidemics or pandemics, and other events beyond our control and the control of our suppliers. Our corporate headquarters, information technology, manufacturing, certain research and development activities, and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults or flood zones. While we are partially insured for earthquake-related losses or floods, our operating results and financial condition could be materially affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.\nIn the case of our managed services business, any circuit failure or downtime could affect a significant portion of our customers. Since our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions could harm our reputation, require that we incur additional expense to acquire alternative telecommunications capacity, or cause us to miss contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our business.\nShould any of the events above arise we could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production, and disruptions in the operations of our suppliers. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by these events.\n14. Our corporate values has contributed to our success, and if we are unable to maintain them, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate values, which we believe fosters innovation, operational excellence, focus on our customers, teamwork, and integrity. As we evolve and change as an organization, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate values, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Any failure to preserve our values could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\n15. The increased use of software in our products could impact the way we recognize revenue which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are increasingly incorporating advanced software features and functionalities into our products, offering firmware and software fixes, updates, and upgrades and developing Internet based software-as-a-service offerings that provide additional value that complements our products. As the nature and extent of software integration in our products increases or if sales of standalone software applications or services become material, the way we report revenue related to our products and services could be significantly affected. For example, we are increasingly required to evaluate whether our revenue transactions include multiple deliverables and, as such, whether the revenue generated by each transaction should be recognized upon delivery, over a period of time or apportioned and recognized based on a combination of the two. Moreover, the software and services revenue recognition rules are complex and dynamic. If we fail to accurately apply these complex rules and policies, particularly to new and unique products or services offerings, we may incorrectly report revenues in one or more reporting periods, which could materially and adversely impact our results for the affected periods, cause our stock price to decline, and result in securities class actions or other similar litigation.\n16. We operate in multiple tax jurisdictions globally and our corporate tax rate may increase or we may incur additional income tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in various tax jurisdictions throughout the world, and a substantial portion of our taxable income has historically been generated in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Should there be changes in foreign tax laws that seek to impose withholding taxes on the repatriation of cash or increase foreign tax rates on overseas earnings our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nVarious governmental tax authorities have recently increased their scrutiny of tax strategies employed by corporations and individuals. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued guidelines and proposals during fiscal year 2016 that may change how our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results.\nWe are also subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other tax authorities, including state revenue agencies and foreign governments. While we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from examinations by the IRS and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the actual outcome resulting from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n17. Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions that could negatively impact our financial results. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. As rule making bodies and new legislation is enacted to interpret the Tax Act, these changes may adjust the estimates provided in this report. The changes may possibly be material, due to, among other things, the Treasury Department\u2019s promulgation of regulations and guidance that interpret the Tax Act, corrective technical legislative amendments that may change the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries. Another example is on November 12, 2019, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Altera Corporation\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc following the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision against Altera issued on June 7, 2019 (the \u201c2019 Opinion\u201d). Consistent with the 2019 Opinion and in conjunction with an IRS audit for the fiscal year ended March 2017, the Company has taken a charge for the Altera case and is fully reserved resulting in a higher year over year tax expense in fiscal year 2020.\nIn addition, it is uncertain how each country where we do business may react to the Tax Act. Moreover, the evolving global tax landscape accompanying the adoption and guidance associated with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements (\u201cBEPS\") recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") may require us to make adjustments to our financial results. As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is difficult to assess whether the overall effect of these potential tax changes would be positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.\n18. We may not be able to utilize our deferred tax assets.\nAs a global enterprise, we cannot be certain of the tax outcome related to many transactions and calculations. Uncertainties arise as a consequence of positions taken regarding valuation of deferred tax assets, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that maybe used in certain tax jurisdictions to offset future taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. Each quarter, we determine the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized. This determination involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including historical operating results, expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Realization of net deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income. If unfavorable changes in the financial outlook of our operations continue or increase, our financial position could be negatively impacted. As of March 28, 2020, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance of $72 million against our U.S. deferred tax assets based on the Company's results for Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020, together with our Fiscal Year 2021 forecast.\n19. We face risks associated with developing and marketing our products, including new product development and new product lines.\nOur success depends on our ability to assimilate new technologies in our products and to properly train our channel partners, sales force and end-user customers in the use of those products.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, such as the demand for HD video technology and lower cost video infrastructure products, the shift from on premise-based equipment to a mix of solutions that includes hardware and software and the option for customers to have video delivered as a service from the cloud or through a browser, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, including an increased emphasis on software products, new, lower cost hardware products, development of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions that may make all or a portion of our products or their functionality obsolete or unnecessary. Historically, our focus has been on premise-based solutions for the enterprise and public sector, targeted at vertical markets, including finance, manufacturing, government, education and healthcare. In addition, in response to emerging market trends, and the network effect driven by business-to-business and business-to-consumer adoption of UC&C, we are expanding our focus to capture opportunities within emerging markets including mobile, small and medium businesses (\u201cSMBs\u201d), and cloud-based delivery. If we are unable to successfully capture these markets to the extent anticipated, or to develop the new technologies and partnerships required to successfully compete in these markets, then our revenues may not grow as anticipated and our business may ultimately be harmed. Given the competitive nature of the mobile industry, changing end user behaviors and other industry dynamics, these relationships may not evolve into fully-developed product offerings or translate into any future revenues.\nThe success of our new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, product cost, infrastructure for services and cloud delivery, timely completion and introduction of new products, proper positioning and pricing of new products in relation to our total product portfolio and their relative pricing, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and other products in our own portfolio, market acceptance of these products and the ability to sell our products to customers as comprehensive UC&C solutions. Other factors that may affect our success include properly addressing the complexities associated with compatibility issues, channel partner and sales strategies, sales force integration and training, technical and sales support, and field support. As a result, it is possible that investments that we are making in developing new products and technologies may not yield the planned financial results.\nWe also need to continually educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion as to the desirability of new product offerings and solutions compared to our existing product offerings and to be able to articulate and differentiate the value of new offerings over those of our competitors. As the market evolves, our distribution model and channel partners may change as well. During the last few years, we have announced and launched several new product offerings, both independently and jointly with our strategic partners, including new software, hardware and cloud-based solutions, and these new products could cause confusion among our channel partners and end-users, thereby causing them to delay purchases of our new products until they determine their market acceptance, or as they consider a more comprehensive UC&C strategy versus point product or endpoint only deployments. Any delays in future purchases could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and operating results in the period of the delay.\nThe communications market shift to fully integrated solutions, cloud-based/hybrid offerings and new business models over time may require us to add new channel partners, enter new markets and gain new core technological competencies. We are attempting to address these needs and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts, through joint developments with other companies and through acquisitions. However, we may not identify successful new product opportunities and develop and bring products to market in a timely manner. Further, as we introduce new products, these product transition cycles may not go smoothly, causing an increased risk of inventory obsolescence and relationship issues with our end-user customers and channel partners. The failure of our new product development efforts, any inability to service or maintain the necessary third-party interoperability licenses, our inability to properly manage product transitions or to anticipate new product demand, or our inability to enter new markets would harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to develop new products or enhance the capabilities of our existing products to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and customer requirements or successfully manage the transition to new product offerings as enterprises shift to a remote workforce as a result of COVID-19.\nFor the past several months, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses around the world to shift their employees to remote work due to shelter-in-place orders. As a result, we believe that businesses may be shifting to permanent remote work for some or all of their workforce and we have experienced downward pressure on the sales of our audio and video solutions which typically are used in office environments. A continuation of the movement towards these remote and/or flexible work practices could over time erode the overall demand for office equipment and further erode sales of our voice and video product lines. While we are taking actions to develop new and/or increase the manufacturing of our existing collaboration tools that enable both in office and remote work, our failure to timely accommodate this rapidly shifting market demand could negatively impact on our financial\nresults. For additional risks related to COVID-19, see the risk factor \"The recent global COVID-19 outbreak has harmed and could continue to harm our business and results of operations.\"\nWe may experience delays in product introductions and availability, and our products may contain defects which could seriously harm our results of operations.\nWe have experienced delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements in the past. The delays in product release dates that we experienced in the past have been due to factors such as unforeseen technology issues, third party changes to technology, manufacturing ramping issues and other factors, which we believe negatively impacted our revenue in the relevant periods. In addition, we have experienced delays in product certifications required with respect to our new product releases. Any of these or other factors may occur again and delay our future product releases. As such, disruption due to geopolitical conflicts, public health, or natural disasters could create an increased risk of delays in new product introductions.\nWe produce highly complex communications equipment, which includes both hardware and software and incorporates new technologies and component parts from different suppliers. Resolving product defect and technology and quality issues could cause delays in new product introduction. Component part shortages, availability, and changes could also cause delays in product delivery and lead to increased costs. Further, some defects may not be detected or cured prior to a new product launch or may be detected after a product has already been launched and may be incurable or result in a product recall. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the failure of a partial or entire product line or a withdrawal of a product from the market. We may also have to invest significant capital and other resources to correct these problems, including product re-engineering expenses and inventory, warranty and replacement costs. These problems might also result in claims against us by our customers or others and could harm our reputation and adversely affect future sales of our products.\nAny delays for new product offerings recently announced or currently under development, including product offerings for mobile, cloud-based delivery, software delivery or any product quality issues, product defect issues or product recalls could adversely affect the market acceptance of these products, our ability to compete effectively in the market, and our reputation with our customers, and therefore could lead to decreased product sales and could harm our business. We may also experience cancellation of orders, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increased service and warranty costs in excess of our estimates, diversion of resources and increased insurance costs and other losses to our business or to end-user customers.\nProduct obsolescence or discontinuance and excess inventory can negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe pace of change in technology and in the release of new products has increased and is expected to continue to increase, which can often render existing or developing technologies obsolete more quickly. In addition, the introduction of new products and any related actions to discontinue existing products can cause existing inventory to become obsolete. These obsolescence issues, or any failure by us to properly anticipate product life cycles, can require write-downs in inventory value. For each of our products, the potential exists for new products to render existing products obsolete, cause inventories of existing products to increase, cause us to discontinue a product or reduce the demand for existing products.\nFurther, we continually evaluate our product lines both strategically and in terms of potential growth rates and margins. Such evaluations could result in the discontinuance or divestiture of those products in the future, which could be disruptive and costly and may not yield the intended benefits.\nWe face risks related to building platforms dependent upon adoption of third-party providers.\nWe have invested significant resources developing products that are dependent on the adoption of third-party unified communication as a service (UCaaS) and video conferencing as a service (VCaaS) software applications. We made the decision to be agnostic in our approach to offer customers greater choice and flexibility, while expanding our ecosystem partners and enhancing their unique value differentiation through our products. If these partners\u2019 solutions do not gain adoption and growth, it could impact the sales of our endpoint devices. If other hardware manufacturers follow the Company\u2019s strategy and enter into the market, thereby increasing competition, we could see less market demand or revenue for our products. Lastly, the third-party partners could decide to build their own hardware platforms to provide further differentiated features and choose not to work with us. We believe though that customers want the ability of choice and quality that Poly products provides.\nIn addition, we develop these products or make product enhancements based upon anticipated demand for new features and functionality. Our business and revenues may be harmed if: (i) the use of our agnostic platform does not occur; (ii) we do not anticipate shifts in technology appropriately or rapidly enough; (iii) the development of suitable sales channels does not occur, or occurs more slowly than expected; (iv) our products are not priced competitively or are not readily adopted; or (v) the adoption rates of the third-party software applications do not drive demand for our products as we anticipate. Although we believe increased sales of these remote working solutions will drive increased demand for our hardware and software platform products, such\nincreased demand may not occur, or we may not benefit to the same extent as our competitors. We also may not be successful in creating demand in our installed customer base for products that we develop that incorporate these new partner platforms.\nLower than expected market acceptance of our products, price competition and other price changes would negatively impact our business.\nIf the market does not accept our products, particularly our new product offerings on which we are relying on for future revenues, such as product offerings for platform software, new hardware products and cloud-based delivery, our business and operating results could be harmed. Further, revenues relating to new product offerings are unpredictable and new products typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction and higher marketing and sales costs. As we introduce new products, they could increasingly become a higher percentage of our revenues. Our profitability could also be negatively affected in the future as a result of continuing competitive price pressures in the sale of UC&C solutions equipment and UC platform products. Further, in the past we have reduced prices in order to expand the market for our products, and in the future, we may further reduce prices, introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to expand the market or stimulate demand for our products, or discontinue existing products as a means of stimulating growth in a new product.\nFinally, if we do not fully anticipate, understand and fulfill the needs of end-user customers in the vertical markets that we serve, we may not be able to fully capitalize on product sales into those vertical markets and our revenues may, accordingly, fail to grow as anticipated or may be adversely impacted. We face similar risks as we expand and focus our business on the SMB and service provider markets. In light of the COVID-19 there are shifts in end user needs, including for example increased work from home, tele-medicine, tele-education, and other remote services that are exacerbated in a pandemic, which may present opportunities for growth. However, if we fail to take advantage of such changes and they impact our products, we may risk missing a critical market shift.\nFailure to adequately service and support our product offerings could harm our results of operations.\nThe increasing complexity of our products and associated technologies has increased the need for enhanced product warranty and service capabilities, including integration services, which may require us to develop or acquire additional advanced service capabilities and make additional investments. If we cannot adequately develop and train our internal support organization or maintain our relationships with our outside technical support providers, it could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, sales of our immersive telepresence solutions are complex sales transactions, and the end-user customer may purchase an enhanced level of support service from us to ensure that its significant investment can be fully operational and realized. This requires us to provide advanced services and project management in terms of resources and technical knowledge of the customer\u2019s telecommunication network. If we are unable to provide the proper level of support on a cost-efficient basis, it may cause damage to our reputation in this market and may harm our business and results of operations.\n20. Delays or loss of government contracts or failure to obtain or maintain required government certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe sell our products both directly and indirectly and provide services to governmental entities in accordance with certain regulated contractual arrangements. While reporting and compliance with government contracts is both our responsibility and the responsibility of our partner, a lack of reporting or compliance by us or our partners could have an impact on the sales of our products to government agencies. Further, the United States Federal government has certain certification and product requirements for products sold to them. For instance, the United States Federal government remains focused on risks specific to products and applications designed, developed, or manufactured in other countries and the potential for security vulnerabilities to be inadvertently or intentionally embedded in such products and applications. If we are unable to meet or maintain applicable certification or other requirements specified by the United States Federal government or to do so within the time frames required, or if our competitors have certifications for competitive products for which we are not yet certified, our revenues and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\n21. We have incurred significant indebtedness to finance the Acquisition of Polycom, which will decrease our business flexibility and increase borrowing costs, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nPrior to the Acquisition of Polycom, we had $500 million in 5.50% senior unsecured notes outstanding and the ability to draw up to $100.0 million against a revolving line of credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. In connection with the Acquisition of Polycom, the Company (i) borrowed an additional $1.275 billion from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which was financed through a senior secured term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% maturing in July 2025 and (ii) replaced our existing revolving line of credit agreement with a secured credit facility (collectively the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) . As a result, upon completion of the Acquisition, we increased our indebtedness to an amount materially greater than historical levels. Our increased indebtedness and our higher debt-to-equity ratio have the effect, among other things, of:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our currently existing or future indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate including, without limitation, restricting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to grant liens or enter into certain types of transactions such as sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates and terms we find acceptable; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to repay or refinance the then-outstanding principal balance of any debt on maturity or to repay or refinance other future indebtedness.\nThe results from our operations may not allow us to comply with the covenants in the debt agreements or may require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act contrary to our business objectives. A breach of our debt covenants could result in a default. This could permit the holders of such debt to accelerate such debt or demand payment in exchange for a waiver of such default. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay all or any portion of it when due. On February 20, 2020 the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d), by and among the Company and the financial institutions party thereto as lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to modify the covenants associated with the revolving line of credit to increase the maximum secured net leverage ratio and decrease the minimum interest coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as distressed and volatile financial and/or consumer markets, including due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement are for the benefit of the revolving credit lenders only, and the Company is able to terminate the revolving credit facility without premium or penalty on three business days\u2019 notice under the terms of the Credit Agreement. For further details see \"Item 7. Liquidity and Capital Resource.\"\nOur current debt under the Credit Agreement has a floating interest rate that is based on variable and unpredictable U.S. and international economic risks and uncertainties and an increase in interest rates may negatively impact our financial results. We enter into interest rate hedging transactions that reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates. There is no guarantee that our hedging efforts will be effective or, if effective in one period will continue to remain effective in future periods.\nOur Credit Agreement utilizes LIBOR to calculate the amount of accrued interest on any borrowings. Regulators in certain jurisdictions including the United Kingdom and the United States have announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The transition from LIBOR to a new replacement benchmark is uncertain at this time and the consequences of such developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could result in an increase in the cost of our borrowings under our existing credit facility and any future borrowings.\nIn addition, the mandatory debt repayment schedule of the Credit Agreement and the maturity of our existing 5.50% Senior Notes in 2023 may negatively impact our cash position, further reduce our financial flexibility, and cause concerns with analysts and investors. Furthermore, any changes by rating agencies to our credit rating in connection with such indebtedness may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our debt and equity securities.\nShould any of the risks referenced above or related risks occur, our operations and financial results may be materially negatively impacted.\n22. If our own manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, suppliers and sub-suppliers are unable or unwilling to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components and finished products, our ability to fulfill customer demand may be adversely impacted and our growth, business, reputation and financial condition may be materially negatively affected.\nWe depend on manufacturing operations conducted in our own facility in Tijuana, Mexico and through contract manufacturers, original design manufactures, and suppliers to manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with contract manufacturers, original design manufactures, and suppliers, we depend on these relationships and parties to timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials and components as well as finished products of acceptable quality at acceptable prices. The Company and our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers procure materials, components and sub-components from a long and often complex chains of sub-suppliers to assemble them into finished products. The cost, quality, and availability of the services, materials and components and finished products that our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties provide are essential to our business. It is time consuming and costly to qualify parties into our supply chain, which if we fail to manage could cause delays, quality control issues, and disruption in our manufacturing. With more suppliers and locations to manage in our supply chain the complexity increases. We have in the past and may in the future continue to experience delays and increases in time to manufacture and ship our products.\nWe have significant reliance upon our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico which may cause disruption to the supply chain and change established supply chain relationships. We believe that a flexible supply chain allows us to effectively respond to customer demands, but it also requires continuous improvement efforts involving management, production employees, and suppliers. If we are unable to consistently execute on our strategy, our ability to respond to customer demand profitability and timely may be harmed.\nOur reliance on our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico, contract manufacturers, ODMs, suppliers and other third parties involve significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nRisk of disruption by earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, geopolitical unrest, war, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, public health issues, epidemics or pandemics and other events beyond our control and the control of the third parties on which we depend. During the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020, concerns related to the spread of COVID-19 began to create global business disruptions, including disruptions in our operations and creating potential negative impacts on our revenue. Disruptions include interruption in product supply, restrictions on the export or shipment of our products, temporary closure of supplier and manufacturing facilities as well as our own manufacturing facility. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our financial results and operations is uncertain. There can be no assurance that the disruptions due to COVID-19 will be resolved in the near term at our facility in Tijuana, Mexico or in our supply chain partners. Other risks that may result from interruptions to our business due to COVID-19 are discussed in the risk factor entitled \"The recent global COVID-19 outbreak has harmed and could continue to harm our business and results of operations.\"\n\u2022\nWe rely on a significant portion of our manufacturing operations outside of the United States, which subjects us to increased risk associated with importing, tariffs, pandemics, labor regulations and regional conflicts. For example, certain products of ours have been subject to import tariffs associated with our manufacturing in Mexico and China. We have incurred increased costs to mitigate the impact of these tariffs. With the outbreak and spread of COVID 19, the temporary closure of factories, businesses, and restrictions on public movement of people and goods, resulted in a delay in production for certain components and finished goods products and may result in further delays in the future.\n\u2022\nCertain suppliers may become financially unstable or unwilling or unable to provide materials or components to us, resulting in us having to find new suppliers. It may take months to find and on board a new supplier and may require a redesign of our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. The Company may experience significant delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products to customers. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components in a reasonable time and affordable cost, if at all. The current coronavirus outbreak known as COVID 19, may result in longer periods of commercial and government restrictions, that have impacted our ability to obtain certain materials and components and to manufacture our products at our facility and our manufacturing partners.\n23. We are dependent on certain sole source and limited source suppliers, including for key components, which makes us susceptible to shortages, quality issues or price fluctuations in our supply chain, and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future.\nWe rely on suppliers for critical aspects of our business to obtain hardware components, subsystems and systems from a limited group of suppliers. Suppliers may choose not to renew their contracts with the company or to discontinue supplying materials and components or finished products to us for a variety of reasons, including conflicting demands from their other customers, availability, price, and discontinuing production of such product. A lack of viable alternative sources of materials and components or the high development costs associated with existing and emerging wireless and other technologies may require us to work with a single source of supply for certain components. We currently purchase certain integrated circuits from single or limited sources. Moreover, lead times can be particularly long, are subject to change, and availability for such components can be constrained or in limited supply. With consolidation there are also fewer components available to us. This consolidation can negatively impact our ability to access certain parts and at the prices that impact our gross margin. Companies may also elect not to continue their business relationship with us for reasons beyond our control or impose price increases that negatively impact our ability to sell our product.\nTo develop alternative sources for manufacturing and component supply is costly, time consuming and difficult. If we are unable to procure the components in a timely basis, we may not be able to meet our customer demands and thereby materially and adversely affect our business and operations, and as a result impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n24. Managing the supply of products and component inventory is complex. Insufficient inventories may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may impact our gross margin.\nThe Company, contract manufacturers, and original design manufacturers purchase components to build products based upon our forecasts and demand for our products. In order to reduce manufacturing lead-times and plan for sufficient component supply,\nfrom time to time we will purchase components and product that are non-cancelable and non-returnable, or commit to purchase certain volumes of products.\nCertain materials and components used in our products are periodically subject to supply shortages and our business is subject to delays in delivery and the risk of higher prices. During periods of high demand and supply shortages from our suppliers we may experience component shortages. We have experienced some supply shortages for components and finished goods as COVID 19 has spread as factories and businesses temporarily closed and restrictions on public movement of people and goods resulted in a delay in production for certain components and finished goods products. Any failure to obtain key components to meet our product roadmaps or customer demand may (i) require us to obtain a replacement supply of satisfactory quality which may be difficult, time-consuming, or costly, (ii) force us to redesign or end-of-life certain products, (iii) delay manufacturing, (iv) require us to make large last-time buys based on speculative long-term forecasts in excess of our short-term needs, holding materials and components or finished products in inventory for extended periods of time, or (v) being unable to meet customer demand. If we are unable to obtain components from third party suppliers in the quantities and quality that we require, on a timely basis, and at the prices required, then we may not be able to deliver our products on time, in a cost effective manner, which would harm our business.\nRapid increases in production levels to meet product demand, whether or not forecasted, could result in shipment delays, higher costs for materials and components, increased expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of required materials, late delivery penalties, and higher overtime costs and other expenses, any of which could materially negatively impact our revenues, reduce profit margins, and harm relationships with affected customers. If constraints were to occur in existing or future product lines our ability to meet demand and our corresponding ability to sell affected products may be materially reduced. Moreover, our failure to timely deliver desirable products to meet demand may harm relationships with our customers. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing yields may decrease, which may also reduce our revenues or margins.\nOur inventory management systems and supply chain visibility tools may not enable us to accurately forecast and manage the supply of our products and components. If we determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce prices or write down inventory. Alternatively, insufficient supply levels may lead to a shortage of products to sell and less revenue.\nA portion of the materials and components used in our products are provided by our suppliers on consignment. As such, we do not take title to, or risk of loss of, these materials and components until they are consumed in the production process. Our consignment agreements generally allow us to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities at the suppliers\u2019 expense. Returns for other reasons are negotiated with suppliers on a case-by-case basis and are generally immaterial. If we are required or choose to purchase all or a material portion of the consigned materials and components or if a material number of our suppliers refuse to accept orders on consignment, our inventory turn rate may decline or we could incur material unanticipated expenses, including write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in prices from our suppliers, particularly in light of price fluctuations for oil, gold, copper, and other materials and components in the U.S. and around the world, which could negatively affect our profitability or market share. If we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers or achieve operating efficiencies that offset any increases, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially negatively affected.\n25. Our financial performance may be impacted if we fail to manage our channel inventory.\nOur channel inventory management is complex, as we sell products through our global channel network which includes distributors, direct and indirect resellers, network and systems integrators, service providers, wireless carriers, and mass merchants. The Company must manage both Company owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand, pricing challenges, and analyzing point of sales information regarding sales to resellers and end users that our channel partners provide. Our forecasts may not accurately predict demand, and distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, or in limited cases, may cancel orders or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. The Company\u2019s reliance upon our global channel network may reduce our visibility into inventory quantities, demand and pricing trends, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may need to reduce our prices and write down inventory. In addition, factors in different markets may cause differential discounting between the geographies where our products are sold, which makes it difficult to achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey market sales.\n26. Our new and evolving service offerings are strategically important to our future growth and profitability and our business may be harmed or our revenues and profitability materially hurt if we fail to successfully bring new offerings to market.\nOur future growth and profitability are tied to our ability to successfully bring to market new and innovative services offerings like Poly Lens, our cloud management and insights solution. We are investing significant time, resources and money into our\nservices offerings without expectation that they will provide material revenue in the near term and without any assurance they will succeed. Moreover, we expect that as we continue to explore, develop and refine new offerings they will continue to evolve, may not generate sufficient interest by end customers, may create channel conflicts with our existing hardware distribution partners, and we may be unable to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or achieve or maintain acceptable levels of profitability.\nAdditionally, our experience with cloud services offerings is limited. We are also substantively reliant on third party service providers for significant aspects of our offerings and over whom we have little or no market power regarding pricing, support, service levels and compliance. If we do not successfully execute our cloud strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers, our credibility as a cloud services provider could be questioned and our prospects for future revenue growth and profitability may never materialize.\nMoreover, if our new and evolving business model offerings achieve market acceptance, differences in revenue recognition treatment may cause short-term revenue declines or increase expenditures for operational, administrative and technical support.\nAccordingly, if we fail to successfully launch, manage and maintain our new and evolving services offerings future revenue growth and profitability may be limited and our business significantly harmed.\n27. Our business could be negatively impacted if we lose the benefit of the services of key personnel or if we fail to attract, motivate and retain talented new personnel.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the services of a limited number of executive officers and other key employees. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, whether or not anticipated, could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled technical, management, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and the salary, benefits and other costs to employ the right personnel may make it difficult to achieve our financial goals. Consequently, we may not be successful in attracting, motivating and retaining such personnel, and our failure to do so could have a negative effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\n28. Our ability to process purchase orders and ship products in a timely manner depends on our information technology (IT) systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our suppliers, manufacturers, customers or other partners, as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties.\nSome of our business processes depend upon our IT systems, the systems and processes of third parties, and the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties. For example, our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our manufacturing systems, which enables us and our supply chain to build and ship products. If these systems fail or are interrupted, our processes may operate at a diminished level or not at all. This could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business, and our financial results could be harmed. Any systems failure or interruptions during the transition may impair communications with our manufacturers and customers, and, therefore, adversely affect our ability to build and ship our products. If our systems, the systems and processes of those third parties, or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail, our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted, and our financial results could be harmed.\n29. As we focus on growth opportunities, we are divesting or discontinuing non-strategic product categories and pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe continue to review our product portfolio and address our non-strategic product categories and products through various options including divestiture and cessation of operations like the sale of our consumer gaming assets under the RIG brand in 2020 and our Clarity division in 2017. If we are unable to execute divestitures on favorable terms or if realignment is costlier or more distracting than we expect or has a negative effect on our organization, employees and retention, then our business and operating results may be adversely affected. Discontinuing products with service components may also cause us to continue to incur expenses to maintain services within the product life cycle or to adversely affect our customer and consumer relationships and brand. Divestitures may also involve warranties, indemnification or covenants that could restrict our business or result in litigation, additional expenses or liabilities. In addition, discontinuing product categories, even categories that we consider non-strategic, reduces the size and diversification of our business and causes us to be more dependent on a smaller number of product categories.\nAs we attempt to grow our business in strategic product categories and emerging market geographies, we will continue to consider growth through acquisitions or investments like the Acquisition of Polycom as well as joint ventures. We will evaluate acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or service offerings or with additional industry expertise, assets and capabilities. Such endeavors and acquisitions will involve significant risks and uncertainties which may include:\n\u2022\ndistraction of management from current operations;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected liabilities and expenses;\n\u2022\ninadequate return on capital;\n\u2022\ninsufficient sales and marketing expertise requiring costly and time-consuming development and training of internal sales and marketing personnel as well as new and existing distribution channels;\n\u2022\ncertain structures such as joint ventures may limit management or operational control because of the nature of their organizational structures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, products, technology, internal controls, personnel and management teams;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of our equity securities and incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nprohibitive or ineffective intellectual property rights or protections;\n\u2022\nunknown market expectations regarding pricing, branding and operational and logistical levels of support;\n\u2022\nuncertain tax, legal and other regulatory compliance obligations and consequences;\n\u2022\nnew and complex data collection, maintenance, privacy and security requirements; and\n\u2022\nother unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations.\nMoreover, any acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic, product, financial or other objectives or expectations, which would also cause our business to suffer. Opposition to one of more acquisitions could lead to negative ratings by analysts or investors, give rise objections by one or more stockholders or result in shareholder activism, any of which could harm our stock price. (See the risk factor, \u201cOur business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, and such stockholder activism could impact the trading price and volatility of our common stock\u201d below). Acquisitions can also lead to large non-cash charges that can have a negative impact on our results of operations as a result of write-offs for items such as future impairments of intangible assets and goodwill or the recording of stock-based compensation.\n30. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, and such stockholder activism could impact the trading price and volatility of our common stock.\nWe may be the target of strategic or competitive buyers, private equity investors and activist stockholders from time to time. Responding to actions by potential buyers, investors and activist stockholders, such as public proposals and requests for special meetings, potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction, or other special requests, is costly and time-consuming, disrupts our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction or changes to the composition of our board may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers and partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Such uncertainties may adversely impact our business and future financial results. In addition, our stock price may experience periods of increased volatility as a result of stockholder activism, that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\n31. We are regularly subject to a wide variety of litigation including commercial and employment litigation as well as claims related to alleged defects in the design and use of our products.\nWe are regularly subject to a wide variety of litigation including claims, lawsuits, and other similar proceedings involving our business practices and products including product liability claims, labor and employment claims, and commercial disputes. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as we have grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity.\nFor instance, we have been sued by employees regarding our employment practices and business partners regarding contractual rights and obligations. Efforts to consolidate operations subsequent to the acquisitions such as our Acquisition of Polycom in July 2018 through reductions in force, rationalization of sales channels, and vendor and supplier reductions increase the likelihood of litigation and the diversion of management time and energy. We have also been sued by a competitor, GN Netcom, Inc., regarding alleged violations of certain laws regulating competition and business practices, which lawsuit is more specifically described in Part II, Item 8, Note 9 (Commitments and Contingencies) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should GN's appeal be successful, in whole or in part, we could be required to incur additional litigation fees and expenses, be subject to material damages and penalties and management's attention could be diverted, all of which could materially harm our results of operations.\nFrequently, the outcome and impact of any claims, lawsuits, and other similar proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, regardless of the outcome such proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business.\n32. Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others, and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims or lawsuits. Even if we prevail, claims and lawsuits are costly and time consuming to pursue or defend and may divert management's time from our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, and other intellectual property, including our rights to certain domain names. We rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. Effective protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights may not be available in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed to customers. The process of seeking intellectual property protection can be lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Patents may not be issued in response to our applications, and any that may be issued may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged by others. If we are required to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation, the costs and diversion of management's attention could be substantial. Furthermore, we may be countersued by an actual or alleged infringer if we attempt to enforce our intellectual property rights, which may materially increase our costs, divert management attention, and result in injunctive or financial damages being awarded against us. In addition, existing patents, copyright registrations, trademarks, trade secrets and domain names may not provide competitive advantages or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our rights. If it is not feasible or possible to obtain, enforce, or protect our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nPatents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets are owned by third parties that may make claims or commence litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. These claims or allegations may relate to intellectual property that we develop or that is incorporated in the materials or components provided by one or more suppliers. As we have grown, intellectual property rights claims against us and our suppliers have increased. There has also been a general trend of increasing intellectual property infringement claims against corporations that make and sell products. Our products, technologies and the components and materials contained in our products may be subject to certain third-party claims and, regardless of the merits of the claim, intellectual property claims are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate, settle, or otherwise resolve. Many of our agreements with our distributors and resellers require us to indemnify them for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims. To the extent claims against us or our suppliers are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue the manufacture and distribution of products that are found to be in violation of another party's rights. We also may have to obtain, or renew on less favorable terms, licenses to manufacture and distribute our products or materials or components included in those products, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. Discharging our indemnity obligations may involve time-consuming and expensive litigation and result in substantial settlements or damages awards, our products being enjoined, and the loss of a distribution channel or retail partner, any of which may have a negative impact on our operating results.\n33. We are subject to other legal and compliance risks that could have a material impact on our business.\nIn foreign countries where we have operations, there are risks that our employees, contractors or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to require compliance with, and uncover violations of, these laws and regulations. Nonetheless, we remain subject to risk that one or more of our employees, contractors or agents, including those located in or from countries where practices that may violate U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\n34. We must comply with various regulatory requirements, and changes in or new regulatory requirements that may adversely impact our gross margins, reduce our ability to generate revenues if we are unable to comply, or decrease demand for our products if the actual or perceived technical quality of our products are negatively impacted.\nOur products must meet existing and new requirements set by regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which we sell them. For example, certain of our products must meet local phone system standards and certain of our wireless products must work within existing permitted radio frequency ranges.\nAs regulations and local laws change, new regulations are enacted, and competition increases, we may need to modify our products to address those changes, increasing the costs to design, manufacture, and sell our products, and thereby decreasing our margins or demand for our products if we attempt to pass along the costs. Regulations may also negatively affect our ability to procure or manufacture raw materials and components necessary for our products. Compliance with regulatory restrictions may impact the actual or perceived technical quality and capabilities of our products, reducing their marketability. In addition, if the products we supply to various jurisdictions fail to comply with the applicable local or regional regulations, if our customers or merchants transfer products into unauthorized jurisdictions or our products interfere with the proper operation of other devices, we or end\nusers purchasing our products may be responsible for the damages that our products cause; thereby causing us to alter the performance of our products, pay substantial monetary damages or penalties, cause harm to our reputation, or cause other adverse consequences.\n35. Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan, manage our resources and restructure our business through fluctuating economic and market conditions, and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market and requires effective planning, forecasting, and management to enable us to scale effectively and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. We could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization.\nFrom time to time, we increase investment in our business by, for example, increasing headcount, acquiring companies, and investing more into R&D, sales and marketing, and other parts of our business. Conversely, the Company may restructure our organization to align our workforce and increase operational efficiencies. This includes workforce reductions and contract terminations. For example, we assess our operating performance against our operating goals, evaluate opportunities for improvement, and ability to further align our workforce. Some of our expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to business fluctuations. Changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including sales account coverage, have adversely affected our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. Further, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n36. We are exposed to differences and frequent fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our revenues, gross profit, and profitability.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenues and profitability because we report our financial statements in U.S. Dollars (\u201cUSD\") and purchase a majority of our component parts from our supply chain in USD, whereas a significant portion of our sales are transacted in other currencies, particularly the Euro and the British Pound Sterling (\"GBP\"). If the USD strengthens further, it could further harm our financial condition and operating results in the future. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency rates impact our global pricing strategy, which may result in our lowering or raising selling prices in one or more currencies to minimize disparities with USD prices and to respond to currency-driven competitive pricing actions. Should the dollar remain strong or strengthen further against foreign currencies, principally the Euro and the GBP, we may be compelled to raise prices for customers in the affected regions. Price increases may be unacceptable to our customers who could choose to replace our products with less costly alternatives in which case our sales and market share could be adversely impacted. If we reduce prices to stay competitive in the affected regions, our profitability may be harmed.\nLarge or frequent fluctuations in foreign currency rates, coupled with the ease of identifying global price differences for our products via the Internet, increases pricing pressure and allows unauthorized third party \u201cgrey market\u201d resellers to take advantage of price disparities, thereby undermining our premium brand image, established sales channels, and support and operations infrastructure. We also have significant manufacturing operations in Mexico and fluctuations in the Mexican Peso exchange rate can impact our gross profit and profitability. Additionally, the majority of our suppliers are located internationally, principally in Asia, and volatile or sustained increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Asian currencies may result in increased costs or reductions in the number of suppliers qualified to meet our standards.\nAlthough we hedge currency exchange rate exposures we deem material, changes in exchange rates may nonetheless still have a negative impact on our financial results. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, decisions and actions of central banks and political developments.\nWe hedge a portion of our Euro and GBP forecasted revenue exposures for the future, typically over 12-month periods. In addition, we hedge a portion of our Mexican Peso forecasted cost of revenues and maintain foreign currency forward contracts denominated in Euros, GBP, Australian and Canadian Dollars that hedge against a portion of our foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities. Our foreign currency hedging contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, particularly if the fluctuations are significant or sustained, and we do not execute hedging contracts in all currencies in which we conduct business. There is no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective. Additionally, even if our hedging techniques are successful in the periods during which the rates are hedged, our future revenues, gross profit, and profitability may be negatively\naffected both at current rates and by adverse fluctuations in currencies against the USD. See Item 7A for further quantitative information regarding potential foreign currency fluctuations.\n37. Our corporate re-branding could cause confusion and harm our reputation, harming our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2019 we announced the re-branding of our company as \u201cPoly.\u201d As part of the effort, we adopted a new corporate brand identity and began efforts to promote the relaunch of the combined company. As we adopt and advertise our new brand, our customers, suppliers and the marketplace in general may not embrace the change, or it may cause confusion or it may take time to rebuild our reputation, name recognition and goodwill with our customers, suppliers and end users. Moreover, our re-branding may adversely impact our ability to import and export products into one of more jurisdictions or create uncertainty with our customers (particularly with their ordering and accounts payable processes), which could harm our sales or delay our collections, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n38. The success of our business depends heavily on our ability to effectively market our products, and our business could be materially adversely affected if markets do not develop as expected or we are unable to compete successfully.\nWe regard the markets for UC&C video and audio products as significant long-term opportunities. We believe the implementation of UC&C technologies by large enterprises will be a significant long-term driver of UC&C product adoption, and, as a result, a key long-term driver of our revenue and profit growth. Accordingly, we continue to invest in the development of new products and enhance existing products to be more appealing in functionality and design for the UC&C market; however, there is no guarantee significant UC&C growth will occur, when it might occur, how competitors and partners may impact the development of the markets for UC&C products as they evolve or that we will successfully take advantage of opportunities in the UC&C markets if they do occur.\nOur ability to realize and achieve positive financial results from Enterprise product sales, and UC&C sales in particular, could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nas UC&C becomes more widely adopted, competitors may offer solutions that effectively commoditize our headsets, which, in turn, may pressure us to reduce the prices of one or more of our products;\n\u2022\nmajor platform providers may increase certification programs that drive certain software services and endpoint management towards their products and services, thereby limiting our ability to compete in certain markets;\n\u2022\nthe market success of major platform providers and strategic partners such as Microsoft and Zoom, and our influence over such providers with respect to the functionality of their platforms and product offerings, their rate of deployment, their certification requirements, and their willingness to integrate their platforms and product offerings with our solutions, is limited. For example, Microsoft\u2019s decision to transition from Lync to Skype for Business in early fiscal year 2016, and most recently from Skype for Business to Teams has proved to be a significant market transition that caused end customers to pause their deployment schemes or schedules while they assessed the implications of Microsoft\u2019s decision;\n\u2022\nfailure to timely introduce solutions that are cost effective, feature-rich, stable, durable, and attractive to customers within forecasted development budgets;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully implement and execute new and different processes involving the design, development, and manufacturing of complex electronic systems composed of hardware, firmware, and software that works seamlessly and continuously in a wide variety of environments with multiple devices;\n\u2022\nfailure of UC&C solutions generally, or our solutions in particular, to be adopted with the breadth and speed we anticipate. For example, concerns about data privacy and the security of information and data stored over the Internet and wireless security in general, each of which is further enabled by UC&C solutions, including our products, have caused entities in various markets to reassess the data protection compliance and security safeguards of our devices;\n\u2022\nfailure of our sales model and expertise to support complex integration of hardware and software with UC&C infrastructure consistent with changing customer expectations;\n\u2022\nincreased competition for market share, particularly given that some competitors have superior technical and economic resources enabling them to take greater advantage of market opportunities;\n\u2022\nsales cycles for more complex UC&C deployments are longer as compared to our traditional products;\n\u2022\nour inability to timely and cost-effectively adapt to changes and future business requirements may impact our profitability in this market and our overall margins; and\n\u2022\nfailure to expand our technical support capabilities to support the complex and proprietary platforms in which our products are and will be integrated as well as increases in our support expenditures over time.\nIf our investments in, and strategic focus on, enterprise products and UC&C products in particular, do not generate incremental revenue, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n39. A significant amount of our revenues are generated, and the majority of our product manufacturing and packaging occurs internationally, which subjects our business to risks of international sales, operations and trade.\nInternational sales and manufacturing, marketing and sales expenses represent a significant portion of our revenues and operating expenses. In fiscal year 2020, international revenues represented 52% of our total revenues. International sales and operations are subject to certain inherent risks, which would be amplified if our international business grows as anticipated, including the following:\n\u2022\nrecent economic sanctions imposed, and the potential for additional economic sanctions, by the United States as well as the actual and threatened retaliatory responses by impacted nations, some of which may affect or materially delay our ability to import or sell all or a portion of our products into impacted countries;\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions in international markets, such as the restricted credit environment and sovereign credit concerns in E&A and reduced government spending and elongated sales cycles;\n\u2022\ninformation technology security, environmental and trade protection measures and other legal, regulatory and compliance obligations, some of which may result in fines, penalties and other legal sanctions or affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries where we are deemed to be in violation of our legal or contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of government-led initiatives to encourage the purchase of products from domestic vendors or discourage relationships with certain entities, which can affect the willingness of customers or partners to purchase products from, or collaborate to promote interoperability of products with, companies headquartered in the United States;\n\u2022\nunstable or uncertain political and economic situations such as the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union commonly referred to as Brexit;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changes in our international operations, including changes in key personnel;\n\u2022\ncompliance with global anti-corruption laws such at the United States\u2019 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act, which may be exacerbated by cultural differences in the conduct of business in various regions;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the recent volatility of the U.S. dollar, and the impact of our underlying hedging programs;\n\u2022\nreduced intellectual property rights protections in some countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles, greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax law or interpretations thereof that could lead to potentially adverse tax consequences, such as legislation on revenue and expense allocations and transfer pricing among the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can delay or prohibit the import or export of our products, affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitiveness of our products or prevent us from manufacturing or selling products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, the imposition of more restrictive trade compliance measures, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the U.S. or by countries where we sell our products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including in connection with the U.S. and Mexico border crisis, the increasing trade tensions and tariffs with China and Chinese threats of retaliation, and the U.K.'s pending withdrawal from the EU, could negatively impact our business.\nFurthermore, international revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future as we introduce new products. These fluctuations are primarily the result of our practice of introducing new products in North America first and the additional time and costs required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets. To the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. We may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products.\n40. Cyber attacks on our networks, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, physical intrusion into our facilities, and loss of critical data and proprietary information could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the current environment, there are numerous and evolving security risks including cybersecurity and privacy, criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems such as ours, and those of customers, partners, third-parties\u2019 contractors and vendors, and some of those attempts may be successful. We are not immune to these types of intrusions.\nOur products, services, network systems, and servers may store, process or transmit proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal information, of ours and of our employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Our customers rely on our technologies for the secure transmission of such sensitive and confidential\ninformation in the conduct of their business. We are also subject to existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices, related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection worldwide.\nAlthough we take physical and cybersecurity seriously and devote significant resources and deploy protective network security tools and devices, data encryption and other security measures to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect our systems, products and data, we have and will continue to experience attacks of varying degrees in the conduct of our business. Cyber attackers tend to target the most popular products, services and technology companies, which can include our products, services or networks. As a result, our network is subject to unauthorized access, viruses, embedded malware and other malicious software programs. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose information in order to gain access to our employee, vendor or customer data. Unauthorized access to our network, data or systems could result in disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, employee, customer, or other third party data or systems, the theft of sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property and business and personal information, system disruptions, access to our financial reporting systems, operational interruptions, product or shipment disruptions or delays, and delays in or cessation of the services we offer.\nAny breaches or unauthorized access could ultimately result in significant legal and financial exposure, litigation, regulatory and enforcement action, and loss of valuable company intellectual property. Affected parties or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such breaches could also cause damage to our reputation, impact the market\u2019s perception of us and of the products and services that we offer, and cause an overall loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, resulting in a negative impact on our business, revenues and results of operations, as well as customer attrition.\nIn addition, the cost and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional information technology tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from such a breach, could be significant and impact margins. Further, due to the growing sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage networks, systems, or our products, which change frequently and often are not detected immediately by existing anti-virus and other detection tools, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address or mitigate such cyber attacks or security breaches.\nOther risks that may result from interruptions to our business due to cyber attacks are discussed in the risk factor entitled \u201cBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\u201d\n41. Regulation and unauthorized disclosure of customer, end-user, business partner and employee data could materially harm our business and subject us to significant reputational, legal and operational liabilities.\nWe are subject to an innumerable and ever-increasing number of global laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers, end-users of our products, business partners and employees globally. Data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and often impose requirements that are inconsistent with one another. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information internally and by and between us and other parties with whom we have commercial relations. These laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and may materially increase our cost of doing business, particularly as we expand the nature and types of products and services we offer including, without limitation, our software-as-a-service.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant damages, fines and penalties. For instance, in Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) was adopted in 2016 and became fully effective on May 25, 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act was enacted on June 28, 2018 and became fully effective on January 1, 2020.\nPrivacy laws may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction, and deletion of their personal information), and to implement our business models cost effectively.\nComplying with privacy laws, regulations, or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security have caused and will continue to cause us to incur substantial operational costs and may require us to periodically modify our data handling practices. Moreover, compliance may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, could result in substantial fines or other liability, and may otherwise impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provide services our customers, business partners and employees find valuable. A determination that there have been violations of privacy laws relating to our practices could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and subject us to reputational, legal and operational liabilities.\nWe post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other domestic or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If customers or end users were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.\n42. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing processes or the recycling of all or a portion of the components of our products. It is possible that future environmental legislation may be enacted or current environmental legislation may be interpreted in any given country in a manner that creates environmental liability with respect to our facilities, operations, or products. We may also be required to implement new or modify existing policies, processes and procedures to meet such environmental laws. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. To the extent any new or modified policies, processes or procedures are difficult, time-consuming or costly to implement. we may incur claims for environmental matters exceeding reserves or insurance for environmental liability, our operating results could be negatively impacted\n43. Our largest stockholder has interests which may differ from those of our other stockholders, and sales by that shareholder into the market could impact the price of our common stock.\nAs a consequence of our Acquisition of Polycom, we issued approximately 6.352 million shares of our common stock to Triangle Private Holdings II, LLC (\"Triangle\"), an entity indirectly controlled by Siris Capital Group, LLC (\"Siris\"), which, at such time, was equivalent to approximately 16% of our issued and outstanding shares. In addition, we entered into a Stockholder Agreement on July 2, 2018 (the \u201cStockholder Agreement\u201d) with Triangle pursuant to which we appointed two individuals selected by Triangle to our board of directors. On February 10, 2020, the board of directors of the Company approved an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Stockholder Agreement that provides that Siris and its affiliates may purchase additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in open market transactions, including broker transactions or block trades, so long as immediately following any such purchase, Siris\u2019 percentage ownership interest in the Company does not exceed 19.99%. Any shares so purchased will be deemed \u201cShares\u201d under the Stockholder Agreement and Siris may request that the Company register such shares. The Amendment also provides that any such shares purchased shall be subject to a restriction on sale until the two (2) year anniversary of the date of the Stockholder Agreement. As a result of various open market and broker transactions made on February 24 and 25, 2020, Triangle purchased an additional 750,000 shares of the Company's common stock, increasing the beneficial ownership to 17.8% (based on the number of outstanding shares at such time).\nThe shares of our common stock issued to Triangle as a result of the Polycom Acquisition and the additional purchases made in February 2020 has and will continue to dilute our earnings per share and has made Triangle our largest single stockholder. The interests of Triangle, Siris and its other affiliated entities and individuals may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock. Siris also holds, or in the future may hold, interests in other companies, that may compete with us, and the director representatives of Triangle are generally not required to present to us corporate opportunities such as potential acquisitions or new clients.\nTriangle is permitted to sell up to one-third of our shares issued pursuant to the Acquisition on July 2, 2019, up to two-thirds of their shares as of January 2, 2020 and all of the shares after July 2, 2020. The average daily trading volume of our stock is limited, and any resale of the shares held by Triangle will increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading, which may depress the price of our stock. Additionally, the sale by Triangle or their successors of all or a substantial portion of the shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could impact the price of our common stock.\n44. We cannot guarantee we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs or that we will pay dividends at historic rates or at all.\nWe have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs and payment of quarterly dividends. On April 15, 2020, the board of directors of the Company voted to suspend payment of quarterly dividends. Any determination to resume payments of pay cash dividends at recent rates or at all, or authorization or continuance of any share repurchase programs is contingent on a variety of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our board of directors' continuing determination that such dividends or share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements.\nFailure to repurchase stock or pay cash dividends, or defer debt repayments could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The discontinuance of, or lack of activity to repurchase stock or pay a dividend could also result in a lower market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 80185, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "PLT"}
