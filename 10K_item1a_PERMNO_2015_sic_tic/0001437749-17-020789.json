{"cik": "1002037", "company": "LEARNING TREE INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties, keeping in mind that they are not the only ones that affect us. Additional risks that we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on us.\nGoing Concern; Limited Liquidity and Negative Cash Flows\nWe have had negative cash flows from operations, have not achieved a net profit on an annual basis for the past three years and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are not able to generate positive cash flow, our business operations may not be able to continue.\nOver the past three years we have experienced net losses and declining revenues. In fiscal year 2017, our worldwide revenues from continuing operations decreased to $70.7 million from $81.6 million in fiscal year 2016, or 13.4%. In fiscal year 2016, our worldwide revenues from continuing operations decreased to $81.6 million from $94.9 million in fiscal year 2015, or 14.0%. These conditions raised substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern as reported in the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2016. While we initiated several business strategies and initiatives to stabilize and increase revenue and implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program that reduced both cost of revenues and operating expenses, there is no assurance we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow, improve our profitability or increase our liquidity for fiscal year 2018 and beyond. As a result, the report the Company received from its independent registered public accounting firm on its consolidated financial statements as of September 29, 2017 again contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and may realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern and do not reflect any adjustment that might result if we were not able to continue operations.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017 that accompany this Form 10-K were prepared under the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern. Although our consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustment or impact that might result if we were not unable to continue ongoing operations.\nOur Financing Agreement requires there to be acceptable Company accounts receivable in order to receive advances from our lender, which amounts may not be available in the amounts or at the times that we may need them.\nWe entered into a Financing and Security Agreement dated January 12, 2017 (\u201cFinancing Agreement\u201d) with Action Capital Corporation (\u201cAction Capital\u201d), which provides us with potential access to borrow up to $3.0 million. Amounts advanced to us under this Financing Agreement are subject to the prior approval of Action Capital and the availability of accounts receivable acceptable to Action Capital. Accordingly, there is no assurance that advances will be made to us in the amounts and at the times when they are requested by us, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and ability to operate the business. In addition, we may not have the requisite amount of acceptable accounts receivable in order to borrow up to the maximum principal amount under the Financing Agreement.\nThe loss of available credit under the Financing Agreement or termination of the Financing Agreement could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to operate our business.\nWe are currently in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Financing Agreement. If, however, events were to occur which result in either a termination of the Financing Agreement, us losing all or a substantial portion of our available credit under the Financing Agreement, or if we are otherwise prevented from accessing such funds, and we did not have an alternative line of credit or other additional sources of capital available, then we would need to rely upon our cash and cash equivalents for our working capital needs, which may not be sufficient. In addition, because the Financing Agreement has no set term and may be terminated by either party at any time, we cannot be certain that access to capital sourced through this lending arrangement will be available when needed. If we were unable to replace this source of liquidity, then our ability to fund our operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot be certain that any additional financing will be available to us or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe currently have limited sources of liquidity and may need to obtain another credit facility and/or raise new capital to provide additional liquidity. If we fail to obtain additional liquidity as needed, then we will continue to rely on our balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations to finance our operating cash needs to the extent that our operating cash flows will allow and amounts available under any existing lending arrangements.\nPrior to entering into the Financing Agreement, we primarily relied upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations to finance our operating cash needs. Our working capital needs have exceeded, and are anticipated to continue to exceed for the near future, our cash flows from operations. If we do not generate positive cash flow from operations or have access to advances under the Financing Agreement at the amounts we need or obtain access to capital from additional sources that may or may not be available to us, or even if available, may not be on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts, then our cash and cash equivalents will continue to decline. Consequently, any adverse impact on our operating results would impact our cash flows from operations and our ability to continue to meet our operating cash needs which would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our stock price.\nPrice Fluctuations and Limited Market for Our Common Stock\nHistorically, our common stock price has fluctuated, and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future.\nGeneral Factors. We believe some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of our stock related to factors such as:\n\u2022\nvariations in our revenues, gross margins, cash flows, earnings or other financial results;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business, including recent announcements regarding the Company\u2019s going concern, potential strategic initiatives and cost cutting measures;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning new products, strategies or enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions of new means of delivering training;\n\u2022\nintroductions of new technologies both by our customers and technology vendors; and\n\u2022\nlimited public float and low daily trading volume.\nIn addition, prices in the stock market, particularly for technology-related stocks, have been volatile in recent years. In some cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance.\nFuture Sales of Our Common Stock and Securities.\nSales of our common stock by our founders, officers, directors and employees could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of shares of our common stock. Additionally, the price could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons. In addition to the 13,224,349 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 1, 2017, as of that date, we are authorized to issue up to 650,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options. We cannot predict the effect that any such future sales of our common stock, or the potential for those sales, will have on our share price.\nIn addition, the Company is looking at different strategic options available to it to increase its capital and improve its liquidity, which may include raising capital through the sale of equity or debt securities. If the Company completes the sale of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company, such sales may adversely impact the stock price of the Company\u2019s common stock and also result in potential dilution of existing stockholders.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX US Market (OTCQX) and has a limited trading market.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is quoted on the OTCQX, and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX does not assure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX marketplace generally have limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our securities. This significantly limits the liquidity of the common stock, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. A limited market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using common stock as consideration.\nWe do not currently, and are not expected to in the foreseeable future, meet the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national securities exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which may adversely impact the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is, and is expected to continue to be in the near term, less than $5.00 per share and, therefore, a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Brokers and dealers effecting transactions in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d must disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. Those rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell the Company\u2019s common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock. In addition, if our common stock continues to be quoted on the OTCQX as we expect, then our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations for our stock, and may find few buyers to purchase our stock and few market makers to support its price.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. These FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nWe may be unable to realize our business strategy of improving operating performance, growing our business and generating savings and improvements. Over the past five years the Company has been experiencing a decline in course attendance and revenue generated from our operations. As a result, we have been implementing new strategic initiatives, including those described in this Form 10K, which include offering and expanding the services provided through Workforce Optimization Solutions, adjusting the duration of some of our courses to be more competitive, the comprehensive cost reduction program, Guaranteed to Run (\u201cGTR\u201d) courses, and pricing promotions that are designed to improve our operating performance, stabilize and increase revenue and grow our business. The failure to achieve the goals of some or all of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our business as a whole. There is no assurance that we will be able to pursue, successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any initiative or that we will be able to sustain improvements made to date.\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated, and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future. Fluctuations in our historical operating results have resulted from many factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the future, these or other factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause our stock price to decrease. For example:\nTiming of Course Development, and Sales and Marketing Expenditures. We try to adjust our expenditures for course development and sales and marketing to maintain our long-term profitability, including our assessment of the potential to influence future customer demand, market conditions, and other factors. This may mean accepting reduced margins in poor economic periods, as we must commit too much of our spending before our attendees enroll in our courses. If revenues fall short of our expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures quickly enough to compensate for lower than anticipated revenues. This could compound the impact of any revenue shortfall and further affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.\nMany of the new titles now being offered are not developed or taught by Learning Tree, but rather were obtained from other providers. As we are reselling other providers courses, our ability to ensure a quality customer experience is limited. While we do review and approve partner courses before offering them to our customers, our revenues could be negatively impacted if our customer is not satisfied with their course.\nCourse Scheduling and Marketing Activities. The timing and content of our courses and our marketing activities can affect the number of participants who attend our courses. Some of the activities that can contribute to fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe frequency of our course events;\n\u2022\nthe number of weeks during which our courses can be conducted in a quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing, timely delivery, frequency and size of, and the response to, our marketing and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introduction of new course titles;\n\u2022\nthe average length of courses, based on the current mix of course titles, which affects the average revenue per attendee; and\n\u2022\nthe mix between course events held at customer locations and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins.\nSeasonal Factors. Our quarterly revenues and income fluctuate due to the seasonal spending patterns of our customers, which are affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ncyclic or one-time budgetary considerations;\n\u2022\ngovernment spending and budget cycles;\n\u2022\nfactors specific to their business or industry; and\n\u2022\nweather, holiday and vacation considerations.\nUse of Accounting Estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires us to make estimates and assumptions in calculating our financial results. As one example, we currently offer our customers a multiple-course sales discount referred to as a Training Passport, which allows an individual Passport holder to attend up to a specified number of Learning Tree courses over a one- to two-year period for a fixed price. For a Training Passport, the amount of revenue we recognize for each attendance in one of our courses is based upon the selling price of the Training Passport, the list price of the course taken, the average list price of all courses taken, and our estimate of the average number of courses a Passport holder will actually attend. After expiration of a Training Passport, we record the difference, if any, between the revenue previously recognized and the Training Passport selling price. We base our estimate of the average number of course events that a Training Passport holder will attend based on historical trends. However, these historical trends may not accurately predict the actual number of course events that a Training Passport holder will attend in the future. If average Training Passport attendance rates were to increase, for example, we would have to make negative adjustments to our revenue, which could be significant. For a summary of some of our key accounting estimates, please see our \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets and changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial position. In fiscal year 2012, we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the United States due to current year and projected future pre-tax book losses. We continue to maintain this valuation allowance throughout fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether any deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part, primarily with respect to projected taxable income. The estimate of future taxable income can never be predicted with certainty as it is dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. Substantial variance of actual results from estimated future taxable profits, or changes in our estimate of future taxable profits, could lead to changes in deferred tax assets being realizable, and would require a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance. Our income tax provision could be significantly impacted by estimates surrounding our uncertain tax positions, decisions on repatriation of foreign earnings, and changes to our valuation allowance in future periods. As a result, we may not be able to use the full amount of our deferred tax assets and may be exposed to elevated tax rates or additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial position.\nChanging Regulation of Corporate Governance and Public Disclosure. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs incurred with ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed.\nIntroductions and Adoption of New Technology. Our customers tend to increase their training at times when new technology is being introduced. During periods when fewer new technologies are being introduced, demand for our training courses may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOther Factors. Other factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\ncompetitive forces within our current and anticipated future markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract customers and meet their expectations;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndifferences in the timing of our spending on the marketing of our courses, as well as the timing of our spending on the development of our courses and other areas; and\n\u2022\nexcess capacity and/or unused space in our education centers and/or administrative office facilities, and our ability to sublease or find other uses for it.\nAll or any of these and similar factors could cause our operating results to differ substantially from the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price.\nRisks Associated with Technology Changes\nIf we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price. Changes in technology can affect our business in at least two principal ways. First, we must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and other information technologies and develop courses that effectively train customers in the technologies they use now and will use in the future. Second, we must adapt to changes in the technologies by which we can deliver training to our customers\u2019 employees. As a result of technology developments, we may have to make substantial and unanticipated expenditures to develop new course titles, buy new equipment, or invest in further course development software and processes to deliver our courses. Our liquidity and cash flow situation could negatively impact our ability to accomplish this. Further, we may not adequately anticipate or respond successfully to technology changes for many reasons, including misjudging the impact of technology changes, as well as financial, technological or other constraints. A lack of adequate response on our part to changes in information technology platforms, customer preferences or software technology could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nCompetition\nIf our customers decide that they prefer training offered by new or existing competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price. The IT and management training markets are highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry. No single competitor holds a dominant market share. We face intense competition from both established entities and new entries in the market. Our primary competitors include:\n\u2022\ninternal training departments within our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\ncomputer hardware and software vendors and their Authorized Training and Education Center partners;\n\u2022\nindependent education and training companies;\n\u2022\nacademic providers; and\n\u2022\nsoftware systems integrators.\nSome of our competitors offer course titles and programs similar to ours at lower prices. In addition, some competitors have greater financial and other resources than us. Additionally, hardware and software vendors, as well as software systems integrators, may combine IT education and training with sales of their products or other services, which could allow them to offer training at lower prices than we do. Furthermore, future consolidation of IT vendors or training companies could have a material impact on our future operations.\nThe risk of outsourcing of corporate IT administration and software development overseas to countries or firms not currently served by us could have a material adverse impact on our future operations.\nAlthough instructor-led classroom training continues to dominate the worldwide IT and management training markets, technology-based education and training formats, such as Internet-based distance learning, have gained some acceptance. Accordingly, our future results may also depend on the extent to which the market will continue to accept instructor-led IT and management training and on our ability to develop and market instructor-led courses that compete effectively against technology-based courses offered by our competitors.\nRisks Associated with International Operations\nApproximately 37% of our annual revenue is generated by courses conducted outside the United States. Therefore, if we do not adequately anticipate and respond to the risks inherent in international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars, while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies. Consequently, changes in exchange rates can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results and could result in exchange losses. We do not hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates. Even if we were to use hedging techniques in the future, we might not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of currency fluctuations. Thus, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nOur operations in the United Kingdom pose additional risks to our profitability and operating results. Following a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\"), it is expected that the U.K. government will initiate a process to leave the EU (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Such an exit from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the U.K.\u2019s access to the EU Single Market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. operations and customers. Our U.K. operations service customers in the U.K. as well as in other countries in the EU, and these operations could be disrupted by Brexit, particularly if there is a change in the U.K.\u2019s relationship to the EU Single Market. While the full scope of implementation of the referendum decision is still unclear, companies exposed to or with operations in the U.K., such as ours, may face significant regulatory changes as a result of Brexit implementation, and complying with such new regulatory mandates may prove challenging and costly. In particular, significant portions of the U.K.\u2019s regulatory regime related to intellectual property and data protection are derived from or harmonized with wider EU directives, and significant change is possible should the U.K. withdraw from the EU. Even prior to any change to the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU, the announcement of Brexit may create economic uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit and its consequences could adversely impact customer confidence resulting in customers reducing their spending budgets on our products and services, which would adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nChanges in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as \u201cprivacy laws\u201d) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as \u201cprocess\u201d) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as \u201cpersonal data\u201d) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.\nIn Europe, we are subject to the 1995 European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Directive on Data Protection (\u201c1995 Data Protection Directive\u201d), which requires EU member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. The EU member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. On December 15, 2015, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (Council) reached a political agreement on the future EU data protection legal framework referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which will replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive. The GDPR will have significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. The GDPR will become effective in May 2018. The Company is undertaking measures to seek to comply with the GDPR by the effective date. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions, alter the way we conduct business and/or could otherwise have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOther Risks Associated with International Operations. Additionally, our results of operations may be adversely affected by other international risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in translating our courses into foreign languages;\n\u2022\ninternational political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in and/or compliance with government regulation in various countries;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing our foreign offices, and in training and retaining foreign instructors;\n\u2022\nadverse income tax and transfer pricing consequences; and\n\u2022\npotential costs associated with expansion into new territories or withdrawing from a territory.\nWe expect that international revenues will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenues. A lack of anticipation and response to the risks associated with international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price. Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers, our senior managers and other key personnel. The loss of these people, especially without advance notice, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. It is also very important that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including course instructors, to accommodate growth, new course titles and to replace personnel who leave. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, especially in information technology industries and/or in certain geographic areas, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions as well as our recent operating performance, we may be unable to recruit, train and retain qualified instructors and employees. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nOur business depends largely on our ability to utilize knowledgeable instructors at our various locations. Our business is based on successfully attracting and utilizing professional instructors with the knowledge and ability to effectively deliver our course materials to participants. Because we deliver course events at multiple locations throughout the world, we rely on some of our instructors to travel to such locations to teach our courses. If we are not able to timely send our instructors to locations due to restrictive immigration laws or otherwise, then we may incur additional costs in delivering the course event or face limitations in the local and number of course events we present internationally.\nRisks Associated with Intellectual Property\nEvents outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products and services. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our courses are delivered. We cannot be certain that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar course titles or delivery methods unencumbered by our proprietary rights. If substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. We may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others, or have to pursue claims to protect our proprietary rights. Defending against and prosecuting these claims is costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf substantial unauthorized use of our courses occurs or if we must defend against infringement claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and confidential information. Our course development process and course titles are predominately proprietary and we rely primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, customer licensing agreements, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights. Our course materials generally do not include any mechanisms to prohibit or prevent unauthorized use. As a result, someone could copy or otherwise obtain and use our course materials without authorization, either for educational use or to develop competing courses. In addition, we operate in countries that do not provide protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States. Finally, our intellectual property rights will not prevent competitors from independently developing similar course titles or delivery methods. If substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur, our results of operations and price of our common stock could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others. If such a claim succeeded, we might have to change or eliminate courses and could be required to pay damages or royalties. In addition, litigation over intellectual property rights, whether brought by us or by someone else, could be time-consuming and expensive, even if we were ultimately to succeed. Accordingly, defending and prosecuting these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Changes in patent law, foreign or domestic, may have an impact on our ability to obtain patent protections. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees or former employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nRisks Associated with Laws and Regulations\nChanges to laws and regulations can affect our operations and may limit our ability to operate in certain states and foreign jurisdictions or adversely impact our operating results. Providers of educational programs to the public must comply with many laws and regulations of Federal, state and international governments. Generally, we are exempt from this type of regulation because we contract with the employer of the participants in our courses, and we do not participate in any Federal, state or foreign student aid or loan programs. However, changes to state and foreign laws and regulations targeting educational providers could affect our operations in the future and could limit our ability to obtain authorization to operate in certain states. If we were found in violation of a state\u2019s or foreign jurisdiction\u2019s current or future licensing or regulatory requirements, then we could be subject to civil or criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, and we could also be barred from providing educational services in that state or foreign jurisdiction. In addition, laws and regulatory decisions in many areas other than education could also adversely affect our operations. Complying with current or future legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nWe are subject to tax audits by state, Federal and foreign jurisdictions. Such audits are to be expected and may result in adjustments as a result of the accretion of tax jurisdiction interpretations and changes in operational practices. Any such audits may result in additional taxes being assessed or in the refund of taxes previously paid. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nRisks Associated with Cyber Security\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personal identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nDependence on Key Vendors\nInterruptions of services or support from our key vendors could result in an adverse impact to our operations and financial results. Our business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nControl by Certain Stockholders\nOur Chairman and Founder beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding shares, and therefore could have significant influence over our policies and affairs and is in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions. As of December 1, 2017, Dr. Collins, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, beneficially owned (including shares owned with his wife, Mary Collins, a director of the Company) approximately 56.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Consequently, Dr. Collins and Mary Collins have significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of certain corporate actions and transactions requiring stockholder approval. These may include, for example, the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our corporate governing documents and the approval of business combination transactions, including the sale of the Company, whether by merger or sale of our assets.\nDr. Collins and Mary Collins have made, and may make in the future, statements through amendments to the Schedule 13D filed by them with the SEC with respect to their beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock and any plans or proposals they may have with respect to the matters required by Schedule 13D. Any such statements may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock.\nRisks Associated with Possible Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions\nIf we cannot successfully implement any future acquisitions or other strategic transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price. On occasion, we evaluate business opportunities and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. We could decide to pursue one or more of these opportunities by acquisition or internal development. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve many risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention as a result of evaluating, negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures;\n\u2022\nour exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees of an acquired operation.\nIn addition, an acquisition or other strategic transactions could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute stockholder interests, for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ncharges to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022\nwrite-offs for the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022\ninterest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture; and\n\u2022\nany issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or other strategic transactions that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current common stockholders.\nWe have had limited experience in executing and implementing strategic transactions. Although we have implemented other strategic transactions, those ventures have not always been successful, and we may not succeed in the future. The risks associated with acquisitions and other strategic transactions could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nRisks Associated with Changing Economic Conditions\nGeneral domestic and international economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and common stock price. As a result of the current economic uncertainty and macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world, some of our customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases of courses from us until the economy and their businesses strengthen.\nThe United States government\u2019s inability to agree on a federal budget may adversely impact our operations and financial results. We derive a significant amount of our revenues from the U.S. federal government. We believe the implementation by the U.S. federal government of the automatic spending cuts commonly referred to as \u201cSequestration\u201d in 2013 had a significant negative impact on our North American operations as our government customers faced uncertainty over whether the amount of funds allotted for training was actually available. We believe that this uncertainty then and in the years that have followed led to lower enrollments and cancellation of existing enrollments from the government sector and to some degree from those of our commercial customers that rely heavily on government contracts. Currently the U.S. federal government is operating under a Continuing Resolution and is under the first year of a new Presidential administration, both of which can lead to government agencies using our services not being allocated sufficient funds. Such agencies may then not be able to continue using our services, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nUnited States government action or inaction with respect to the continuing budget deficit could adversely impact our operations and financial results. The inability of the United States Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal year, another sequestration, and/or another shutdown of the United States Government could adversely impact demand for our services by limiting the funding available to many of our customers, particularly those in the government sector. Various entities of the United States government and United States government contractors, on a combined basis, account for more than fifteen percent of our business. Implementation of major legislative reductions to the federal budget could reduce, delay or cancel funding used by our government and government contractor customers to purchase our services, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.\nDomestic and/or International Economic Downturns. A significant part of our revenues comes from Fortune 1000-level companies, their international equivalents, and government organizations. During weak economic conditions, our sales grow more slowly or can even diminish. If the domestic and/or international economy were to continue to weaken, the demand for our services could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nIndustry-Specific Slowdowns. Our customers generally operate in the finance, computer, communications, electronics, systems integration, aerospace, government and military, manufacturing, and energy sectors. When one or more of these industries experiences a slowdown, it can have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nGlobalization Issues. Our operations are concentrated in Europe and North America, which have traditionally been the centers of IT development and implementation. In recent years, there has been increasing IT activity in other parts of the world, such as China and India. If this trend adversely affects IT jobs in regions in which we have our principal operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law could adversely impact the interests of our stockholders. Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, our Bylaws, as amended, and Delaware law could, together or separately, discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so might benefit our stockholders. These provisions may also affect the price investors would receive for their shares of our common stock. Some examples of these provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, as amended, are:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are senior to the common stock, without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations of the rights of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of stockholder actions by written consent.\nNatural Disasters, External Strikes, Acts of War or Terrorism and Other External Events\nSince our founding in 1974, various natural disasters, external labor disruptions, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external factors have from time to time impaired our ability to conduct our business, resulted in the loss of revenue or otherwise affected our operating results. When these or other external events occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nNatural Disasters. Natural disasters can affect our business. For example, severe weather has at times prevented our course participants from traveling to our courses. In these situations, we try to transfer the course participants to later courses, but we may still lose some revenue.\nExternal Strikes. We have had to react to postal, transportation, and other strikes in the countries where we operate. Transportation strikes can make it difficult for our course participants or our instructors to reach course facilities. Although we try to employ strategies to mitigate the impact of external strikes, these alternative means are rarely completely effective and generally increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nActs of War or Terrorism. Threats or acts of war or terrorism can adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks in the United States, Europe and in other countries and continuing hostilities in the Middle East and elsewhere have created significant instability and uncertainty in the world. These and future events may have a material adverse effect on world financial markets, including financial markets in the United States. In addition, threats or acts of war or terrorism can cause course participants to be reluctant regarding or prevented from traveling to our course facilities, thereby resulting in lower attendance rates. Additionally, our suppliers and service providers may be unable to provide required services or materials. These impacts could happen after we have committed to all the costs of our course, so that we would be unable to quickly adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues caused by these events, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price.\nOther External Factors. Other factors outside our control can affect our operations, including those related to our suppliers and service providers. For example, disruptions of telephone networks can prevent customers from enrolling in our courses; disruptions in transportation services can prevent customers from reaching our facilities, and power outages can prevent us from delivering courses.", "PERMNO": 82720, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "LTRE"}
