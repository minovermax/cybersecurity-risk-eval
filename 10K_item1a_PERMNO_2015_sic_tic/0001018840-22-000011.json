Except as may be required by applicable law, we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to COVID-19, certain governments imposed travel restrictions and local statutory quarantines and the Company experienced widespread temporary store closures.The Company has seen a direct, material adverse impact to sales and operations as a result of COVID-19. COVID-19 poses various risks to the Company, certain of which are detailed throughout this \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d. Any one of these risks, or a combination of risks, could result in further adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the following factors, categorized by the primary nature of the associated risk, could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward-looking statements.\nMacroeconomic and industry risks include:\n\u2022COVID-19 has and may continue to materially adversely impact and cause disruption to our business;\n\u2022Changes in global economic and financial conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as other changes in consumer discretionary spending habits could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Failure to engage our customers, anticipate customer demand and changing fashion trends, and manage our inventory commensurately could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Our failure to operate effectively in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Our ability to attract customers to our stores depends, in part, on the success of the shopping malls or area attractions that our stores are located in or around;\n\u2022The impact of war, acts of terrorism, mass casualty events, social unrest, civil disturbance or disobedience could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022The impact of extreme weather, infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, and other unexpected events could result in an interruption to our business, as well as to the operations of our third-party partners, and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nStrategic risks include:\n\u2022Failure to successfully develop an omnichannel shopping experience, a significant component of our growth strategy, or failure to successfully invest in customer, digital and omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Our failure to optimize our global store network could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Our failure to execute our international growth strategy successfully and our inability to conduct business in international markets as a result of legal, tax, regulatory, political and economic risks could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022Our failure to appropriately address emerging environmental, social and governance matters could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and, as a result, our business.\nOperational risks include:\n\u2022Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022If our information technology systems are disrupted or cease to operate effectively, it could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022We may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber-attacks, data protection, credit card fraud and identity theft that could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Our reliance on our distribution centers makes us susceptible to disruptions or adverse conditions affecting our supply chain;\n\u2022Changes in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, labor, transportation, and trade relations could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022We depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture and delivery of all our merchandise, and a disruption of the manufacture or delivery of our merchandise could have a material adverse impact on our business;\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 12\n2021 Form 10-K\n\u2022We rely on the experience and skills of our executive officers and associates, and the failure to attract or retain this talent, effectively manage succession, and establish a diverse workforce could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, fail to remediate a material weaknesses, or fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nLegal, tax, regulatory and compliance risks include:\n\u2022Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Our litigation and stockholder activism, could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Failure to adequately protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022Changes in the regulatory or compliance landscape could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022The agreements related to our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured notes include restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business and our inability to obtain credit on reasonable terms in the future could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe factors listed above are not our only risks. Additional risks may arise, and current evaluations of risks may change, which could lead to material, adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition. The following sets forth a description of the preceding risk factors that we believe may be relevant to an understanding of our business. These risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of our forward-looking statements.\nMACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS.\nCOVID-19 has and may continue to materially adversely impact and cause disruption to our business.\nCOVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows, and may continue to materially adversely impact and cause disruption to our business in the future.\nAs a result of COVID-19, numerous state and local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders or restrictions have resulted in temporary store closures, modified store operating hours, a decrease in customer traffic, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects, thereby negatively impacting our operations. The impact of regulations imposed in the future in response to the pandemic, could, among other things, require that we close our stores or distribution centers or otherwise make it difficult or impossible to operate our business.\nOther factors that would negatively impact our ability to successfully operate during the current COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Our ability to keep our stores open if there is a re-emergence or increase in infection rate;\n\u2022Our ability to attract customers to our stores, given the risks, or perceived risks, of gathering in public places;\n\u2022Our ability to incentivize and retain associates and to reinstate any furloughed store associates;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain rent abatements or enter into rent deferral arrangements with our landlords;\n\u2022Our ability to react to changes in anticipated customer demand and manage inventories, which may result in excess inventories;\n\u2022Our ability to rely on our distribution centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of our merchandise as the distribution centers are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as system failures, accidents, labor disputes, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes;\n\u2022Supply chain delays due to closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny, as well as carrier constraints due to an increase in digital sales;\n\u2022Fluctuations in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, as well as costs of labor and transportation;\n\u2022A more promotional retail environment or our ability to move existing inventory, may cause us to lower our prices, sell existing inventory at larger discounts than in the past, or write down the value of inventory, and increase the costs and expenses of updating and replacing inventory, negatively impacting our margins;\n\u2022Delays in, or our ability to complete, planned store openings on the expected terms or timing, or at all based on shortages in labor and materials and delays in the production and delivery of materials ;\n\u2022The deterioration or fluctuations in the economic conditions in the U.S. or international markets, which could have an impact on consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending;\n\u2022Our ability to attract, retain and manage our associates during periods of extended work from home arrangements;\n\u2022Associates, whether our own or those of our third-party vendors, working offsite through work from home arrangements may rely on residential communication networks and internet providers and may be more susceptible to service interruptions and cyberattacks, and, this period of uncertainty could result in an increase in phishing and other scams, fraud, money laundering, theft and other criminal activity;\n\u2022\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 13\n2021 Form 10-K\n\u2022Our ability to successfully execute against our international expansion plans;\n\u2022Our ability to preserve liquidity to be able to take advantage of market conditions during periods of temporary store closures; and\n\u2022Difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities.\nFactors and uncertainties related to future impacts of COVID-19 on our business, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022The severity and duration of the pandemic, including additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or variants of the virus in areas in which we operate;\n\u2022The availability and acceptance of effective vaccines or medical treatments;\n\u2022The nature and size of federal economic stimulus and other governmental efforts;\n\u2022The impact of the pandemic on overall customer demand and consumer behaviors as well as its impact on macroeconomic factors such as general economic uncertainty, inflation, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; and\n\u2022Any unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response.\nIt is uncertain if and when we will see in-store traffic return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the future. In addition, customers have increasingly relied on technology to shop and to interact with our brands during this unprecedented period and our inability to continue to connect with our customers in this manner going forward could affect our ability to compete and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe factors described above may exacerbate other risks within this section of \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d. Any future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious disease could also have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe impact of war, acts of terrorism, mass casualty events, social unrest, civil disturbance or disobedience could have a material adverse impact on our business\nIn the past, the impact of war, acts of terrorism, mass casualty events, social unrest, civil disturbance or disobedience and the associated heightened security measures in response to these events have disrupted commerce. Further events of this nature, domestic or abroad, including international and domestic unrest, the on-going hostilities in Ukraine, and in China\u2019s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (\u201cSAR\u201d), may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence and consumer spending by causing a decline in traffic, store closures and a decrease in digital demand adversely affecting our operating results.\nFurthermore, the existence or threat of any other unforeseen interruption of commerce, could negatively impact our business by interfering with the availability of raw materials or our ability to obtain merchandise from foreign manufacturers. With a substantial portion of our merchandise being imported from foreign countries, failure to obtain merchandise from our foreign manufacturers or substitute other manufacturers, at similar costs and in a timely manner, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in global economic and financial conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as other changes in consumer discretionary spending habits could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business depends on consumer demand for our merchandise. Consumer preferences and discretionary spending habits, including purchases of our merchandise, can be adversely impacted by recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. Our performance is subject to factors that affect worldwide economic conditions including unemployment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on declines in the financial, residential real estate and mortgage markets, sales and personal income tax rates, fuel and energy prices, global food supplies, interest rates, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security, the value of the U.S. Dollar versus foreign currencies and other macroeconomic factors.\nGlobal uncertainty, including the on-going hostilities in Ukraine, has in the past, and could in the future, cause changes in consumer confidence and in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits globally, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.\nThe economic conditions and factors described above could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and may exacerbate other risks within this section of \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d. Changes in economic conditions could also impact our ability to fund growth and/or result in our becoming reliant on external financing, the availability and cost of which may be uncertain.\nFailure to engage our customers, anticipate customer demand and changing fashion trends, and manage our inventory commensurately could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to anticipate and gauge the fashion preferences of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies constantly shifting demands in a timely manner. Because we may enter into agreements for the\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 14\n2021 Form 10-K\nmanufacture and purchase of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand, pricing shifts, and the sub-optimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases.\nMoreover, there can be no assurance that we will continue to anticipate consumer demands and accurately plan inventory successfully in the future. Changing consumer preferences and fashion trends, whether we are able to anticipate, identify and respond to them or not, could adversely impact our sales. Inventory levels for certain merchandise styles no longer considered to be \u201con trend\u201d may increase, leading to higher markdowns to sell through excess inventory and, therefore, lower than planned margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our merchandise, or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales.\nWe could also be at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to leverage data analytics to retrieve timely, customer insights to appropriately respond to customer demands and improve customer engagement. Any of these events could significantly harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to our own execution, we also need to react to factors affecting inventory flow that are outside our control, such as natural disasters or other unforeseen events that may significantly impact anticipated customer demand as we have seen with COVID-19. If we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors, our inventory management may be affected, which could adversely impact our performance and our reputation.\nOur failure to operate effectively in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe sale of apparel, personal care products and accessories for men, women and kids is a highly competitive business with numerous participants, including individual and chain specialty apparel retailers, local, regional, national and international department stores, discount stores and online-exclusive businesses. Proliferation of the digital channel within the last few years has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies. These increases in competition could reduce our ability to retain and grow sales, resulting in an adverse impact to our operating results and business.\nWe also face a variety of challenges in the highly competitive and constantly evolving retail industry, including:\n\u2022anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer shopping preferences better than our competitors;\n\u2022maintaining favorable brand recognition;\n\u2022marketing our products to consumers in several diverse demographic markets effectively, including through social media platforms which have become increasingly more important in order to stay connected to our customers; as our digital sales penetration has increased.\n\u2022retaining customers, including our loyalty club members, and the resulting increased marketing costs to acquire new customers;\n\u2022developing innovative, high-quality merchandise in styles that appeal to consumers and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors;\n\u2022countering the aggressive pricing and promotional activities of many of our competitors without diminishing the aspirational nature of our brands and brand equity; and\n\u2022identifying and assessing disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors, that could alter the competitive landscape by: improving the customer experience and heightening customer expectations; transforming supply chain and corporate operations through digital technologies and artificial intelligence; and enhancing management decision-making through use of data analytics to develop new, consumer insights.\nIn addition, in order to compete in this highly competitive and constantly evolving industry, at times, we may launch and/or acquire new brands to expand our portfolio. This could result in significant financial and operational investments that do not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return and there can be no guarantee that pursuing these investments will result in improved operating results.\nIn light of the competitive challenges we face, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nDue to our international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries transact in currencies other than their functional currency, including intercompany transactions, which results in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Furthermore, we purchase substantially all of our inventory in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our sales, gross profit and gross profit rate from international operations will be negatively impacted during periods of a strengthened U.S. dollar relative to the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries.Additionally, changes in the effectiveness of our hedging instruments may negatively impact our ability to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 15\n2021 Form 10-K\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact consumer spending, delay or prevent successful penetration into new markets or adversely affect the profitability of our international operations. Certain events, such as the uncertainty as to the on-going hostilities in Ukraine, the ultimate scope and duration of COVID-19, and uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, have increased global economic and political uncertainty in recent years and could result in volatility of foreign currency exchange rates as these events develop. For example, changes in sales assumptions have resulted in changes in the effectiveness to certain of our hedging instruments, and we could see similar impacts in future periods.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends, in part, on the success of the shopping malls or area attractions that our stores are located in or around.\nOur stores are primarily located in shopping malls and other shopping centers, certain of which had been experiencing declines in customer traffic prior to COVID-19. Our sales at these stores, as well as sales at our flagship locations, are partially dependent upon the volume of traffic in those shopping centers and the surrounding area. Our stores may benefit from the ability of a shopping center\u2019s other tenants and area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of the shopping center. We cannot control the loss of a significant tenant in a shopping mall or area attraction, the development of new shopping malls in the U.S. or around the world, the availability or cost of appropriate locations or the success of individual shopping malls and there is competition with other retailers for prominent locations.\nIf the popularity of shopping malls declines among our customers, our sales may decline, and it may be appropriate to exit leases earlier than originally anticipated. In addition, COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as shopping malls, and caused us to enact widespread temporary store closures and our landlords to temporarily close certain of the malls in which our stores operate.\nWhile U.S. Company-operated stores were fully open for in-store service, we continue to see temporary reclosures in certain geographic areas as outbreaks of COVID-19 cases continue to occur and localized responses remain unpredictable. Furthermore, declines in traffic beyond our current expectations could result in additional impairment charges. While were successful in obtaining certain rent abatements and landlord concessions of rent payable as a result of COVID-19 store closures, we may be limited in our ability to obtain rent abatements or landlord concessions of rent otherwise payable going forward.\nAll of these factors may impact our ability to meet our productivity or our growth objectives for our stores and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Part of our future growth is dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations, with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs.\nThe impact of extreme weather, infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, and other unexpected events could result in an interruption to our business, as well as to the operations of our third-party partners, and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur retail stores, corporate offices, distribution centers, infrastructure projects and digital operations, as well as the operations of our vendors and manufacturers, are vulnerable to disruption from natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and other unexpected events, such as COVID-19. These events could disrupt the operations of our corporate offices, global stores and supply chain and those of our third-party partners, including our vendors and manufacturers. In addition to impacts on global operations, these events could result in the potential loss of customers and revenues due to store closures, delay in merchandise deliveries, reduced consumer confidence or changes in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits.\nThese events could reduce the availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise, which could result in delays in responding to consumer demand leading to the potential loss of customers and revenues or we may incur increased costs to meet demand and may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our gross margin and results of our operations.\nOur business has been materially, adversely impacted by COVID-19. Refer to risk factor \u201cCOVID-19 has and may continue to materially adversely impact and cause disruption to our business,\u201d included within this section for further discussion of the ongoing impacts and risks related to COVID-19.\nHistorically, our operations have been seasonal, and extreme weather conditions, including natural disasters, unseasonable weather or changes in weather patterns, may diminish demand for our seasonal merchandise and could also influence consumer preferences and fashion trends, consumer traffic and shopping habits. In addition, to the extent extreme weather causes a physical loss to our stores, distribution centers or offices,we may incur costs that exceed our applicable insurance coverage for any necessary repairs to damages or business disruption.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 16\n2021 Form 10-K\nSTRATEGIC RISKS.\nFailure to successfully develop an omnichannel shopping experience, a significant component of our growth strategy, or failure to successfully invest in customer, digital and omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAs omnichannel retailing continues to grow and evolve, our customers increasingly interact with our brands through a variety of media including smart phones and tablets, and expect seamless integration across all touchpoints. As our success depends on our ability to respond to shifting consumer traffic patterns and engage our customers, we have made significant investments and operational changes to develop our digital and omnichannel capabilities globally, including the development of localized fulfillment, shipping and customer service operations, investments in digital media to attract new customers and the rollout of omnichannel capabilities listed in \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS.\u201d\nWhile we must keep up to date with emerging technology trends in the retail environment in order to develop a successful omnichannel shopping experience, it is possible these initiatives may not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. For example, we could be at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to leverage data analytics to retrieve timely, customer insights to appropriately respond to customer demands and improve customer engagement across channels.\nIn addition, digital operations are subject to numerous risks, including reliance on third-party computer hardware/software and service providers, data breaches, violations of laws, including those relating to online privacy, credit card fraud, telecommunication failures, electronic break-ins and similar compromises, and disruption of internet service. Changes in foreign governmental regulations may also negatively impact our ability to deliver product to our customers. Failure to successfully respond to these risks may adversely affect sales as well as damage the reputation of our brands.\nOur failure to optimize our global store network could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWith the evolution of digital and omnichannel capabilities, customer expectations have shifted and there has been greater pressure for a seamless omnichannel experience across all channels. As a result, global store network optimization is an important part of our business and failure to optimize our global store network could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOpportunities to open new stores experiences and modify existing leases requires partnership with our landlords. If our partnerships with our landlords were to deteriorate, this could adversely affect the pace of opening new store experiences and/or lead to an increase in store closures. In addition, if there is an increase in events such as landlord bankruptcies, or mall foreclosures, competition between retailers could increase for remaining suitable store locations. Pursuing the wrong opportunities and any delays, cost increases, disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations. If our investments in new stores or remodeling and right-sizing existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we attempt to open new stores in prominent locations, it is possible that prominent locations when we opened our stores lose favor. For example, our flagship stores, large-format stores in tourist locations with higher than average construction and operating costs, were initially successful upon opening, but are now outdated and, in the aggregate, have a disproportionate adverse impact on operating results. The cost involved to modernize many of these flagship stores is significant and oftentimes without promise of a return. As a result, we may elect to exit these leases and other of our store leases earlier than originally anticipated, or modify the leases, which could result in material incremental charges.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 17\n2021 Form 10-K\nOur failure to execute our international growth strategy successfully and our inability to conduct business in international markets as a result of legal, tax, regulatory, political and economic risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nInternational expansion is a significant component of our growth strategy and may require significant investment, which could strain our resources and adversely impact current store performance, while adding complexity to our current operations.\nOperational issues that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations if we fail to address them include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022address the different operational characteristics present in each country in which we operate, including employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, lease provisions and local reporting or legal requirements;\n\u2022support global growth by successfully implementing local customer and product-facing teams and certain corporate support functions at our regional headquarters located in Shanghai, China and London, United Kingdom;\n\u2022hire, train and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022maintain good relations with individual associates and groups of associates;\n\u2022avoid work stoppages or other labor-related issues in our European stores where associates are represented by workers\u2019 councils and unions;\n\u2022retain acceptance from foreign customers;\n\u2022manage inventory effectively to meet the needs of existing stores on a timely basis; and\n\u2022manage foreign currency exchange rate risks effectively.\nWe are subject to domestic laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. If any of our overseas operations, or our associates or agents, violate such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn addition, there continues to be global uncertainty, such as the uncertainty as to the on-going hostilities in Ukraine, and uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, and similar events of global unrest. These events have increased global economic and political uncertainty in recent years and could affect our international expansion plans.\nOur failure to appropriately address emerging environmental, social and governance matters could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and, as a result, our business.\nThere is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, associates, business partners and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance matters.\nThe expectations related to environmental, social and governance matters are rapidly evolving, and from time to time, we announce certain initiatives and goals, related to environmental, social or governmental matters, such as those through our participation in the United Nations Global Compact. We could fail, or be perceived to fail to act responsibly, in our environmental, social and governance efforts, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. As a result, we could suffer negative publicity and our reputation could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a negative impact on investor perception and our products' acceptance by consumers. This may also impact our ability to attract and retain talent to compete in the marketplace.\nThere is also uncertainty regarding potential policies related to global environmental sustainability matters. Changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, or environmental protection, among others, including regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or to impose additional costs on commercial water use may result in increased compliance costs for us and our business partners, all of which may negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nFailure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical and public perception about our products or operations, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brands and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEvents that could jeopardize our reputation, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity;\n\u2022We fall victim to a cyber-attack, resulting in customer data being compromised;\n\u2022We fail to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, legal, accounting or environmental standards, or related political considerations;\n\u2022Our associates\u2019 actions don\u2019t align with our values and fail to comply with our Associate Code of Conduct;\n\u2022Third parties with which we have a business relationship, including our brand representatives and influencer network, fail to represent our brands in a manner consistent with our brand image or act in a way that harms their reputation; and\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 18\n2021 Form 10-K\n\u2022Third-party vendors fail to comply with our Vendor Code of Conduct or any third parties with which we have a business relationship with fail to represent our brands in a manner consistent with our brand image.\nOur position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social, governance, public policy or other similar issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could also harm our reputation with consumers or investors.\nIn addition, in recent years there has been increase in media platforms, and in particular, social media and our use of social media platforms is an important element of our omnichannel marketing efforts. For example, we maintain various social media accounts for our brands, including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest accounts. Negative publicity or actions taken by individuals that we partner with, such as brand representatives, influencers or our associates, that fail to represent our brands in a manner consistent with our brand image or act in a way that harms their reputation, whether through our social media platforms or their own, could harm our brand reputation and materially impact our business. Social media also allows for anyone to provide public feedback that could influence perceptions of our brands and reduce demand for our merchandise.\nDamage to our reputation and loss of consumer confidence for these or any other reasons could lead to adverse consumer actions, including boycotts, negative impacts on investor perception and could impact our ability to attract and retain the talent necessary to compete in the marketplace, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIf our information technology systems are disrupted or cease to operate effectively, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems in both our customer-facing and corporate operations to: operate our websites and mobile apps; record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; manage inventory; purchase, sell and ship merchandise on a timely basis; maintain cost-efficient operations; create a customer relationship management database through our loyalty programs; and complete other customer-facing and business objectives. Given the significant number of transactions that are completed annually, it is vital to maintain constant operation of our computer hardware, telecommunication systems and software systems, and maintain data security. Despite efforts to prevent such an occurrence, our information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from computer viruses, power system failures, third-party intrusions, inadvertent or intentional breach by our associates or third-party service providers, and other technical malfunctions. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly, or are obsolete in comparison to those of our competition, we may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems and we could endure delays in our operations. We have made and expect to continue to make significant monetary investments and devote significant attention to modernizing our core systems, and the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than others and may fail to provide the expected benefits.\nWhile we regularly evaluate our information technology systems and requirements, we are aware of the inherent risks associated with replacing and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information, system disruptions and user acceptance and understanding. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems could cause information to be lost or delayed, including data related to customer orders. Such a loss or delay, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during our peak selling seasons, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber-attacks, data protection, credit card fraud and identity theft that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn the standard course of business, we receive and maintain confidential information about customers, associates and other third parties. In addition, third parties also receive and maintain certain confidential information. The protection of this information is critical to our business and subjects us to numerous laws, rules and regulations domestically and in foreign jurisdictions. The retail industry in particular has been the target of many cyber-attacks and it is possible that an individual or group could defeat our security measures, or those of a third-party service provider, and access confidential information about our business, customers and associates. Further, like other companies in the retail industry, during the ordinary course of business, we and our vendors have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks of varying degrees and types, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. In addition, recent sanctions issued by the U.S. government related to the on-going hostilities in Ukraine, could increase the risk of retaliatory state-sponsored cyber-attacks, phishing and other scams, fraud, money laundering, theft and other criminal activity. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that cyber attacks will not have a material impact in the future.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience increased costs associated with protecting confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, including training programs for associates to raise awareness about phishing, malware and other cyber risks, especially as we implement new technologies, such as new payment capabilities or updates to our mobile apps and websites. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems change frequently and increase in complexity and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, or immediately identify and remediate cyber-attacks.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 19\n2021 Form 10-K\nFurthermore, the global regulatory environment is increasingly complex and demanding with frequent new and changing requirements surrounding , information security and privacy, including the China Cybersecurity Law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. We may incur significant costs related to compliance with these laws and failure to comply with these regulatory standards, and others, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, as a result of COVID-19, a portion of our corporate associate population continues to work-from-home on a full or part-time basis. We have also implemented a flexible work policy allowing all of our corporate associates to work remotely from time to time, as have certain of our third-party vendors. Offsite working by associates, increased use of public Wi-Fi, and use of office equipment off premises may be necessary, and may make our business more vulnerable to cybersecurity breach attempts,. phishing and other scams, fraud, money laundering, theft and other criminal activity.\nIf we, or a third-party partner, were to fall victim to a successful cyber-attack, suffer intentional or unintentional data and security breaches by associates or third-parties, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, especially an event that compromises customer data or results in the unauthorized release of confidential business or customer information. In addition, if we are unable to avert a denial of service attack that renders our site inoperable, it could result in negative consequences, such as lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. Additional negative consequences that could result from these and similar events may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, potential legal settlements to affected parties, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or business partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack;\n\u2022increased cybersecurity protection costs, which may include the costs of making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training associates, and engaging third party experts and consultants;\n\u2022lost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack;\n\u2022litigation and legal risks, including costs of litigation and regulatory, fines, penalties or actions by domestic or international governmental authorities;\n\u2022increased insurance premiums;\n\u2022reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and\n\u2022damage to the Company\u2019s competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value.\nAlthough we maintain cybersecurity insurance, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient for a specific cyber incident, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely fashion.\nOur reliance on our distribution centers makes us susceptible to disruptions or adverse conditions affecting our supply chain.\nOur distribution center operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as system failures, accidents, labor disputes, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, as well as other unforeseen events and circumstances, such as COVID-19. We rely on our distribution centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of our merchandise. If our distribution centers are not adequate to support our operations, including as a result of capacity constraints in response to an increase in digital sales, we could experience adverse impacts such as shipping delays and customer dissatisfaction. In addition, if our distribution operations were disrupted, and we were unable to relocate operations or find other property adequate for conducting business, our ability to replace inventory in our stores and process digital and third-party orders could be interrupted, potentially resulting in adverse impacts to sales or increased costs. Refer to \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS,\u201d for a listing of certain distribution centers on which we utilize.\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, labor, transportation, and trade relations could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise and fluctuations in the cost of transportation could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales, or our ability to meet customer demand. The prices for such fabrics depend largely on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton, as well as the cost of compliance with sourcing laws. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields, weather patterns and other unforeseen events.\nIn addition, we have experienced increasing wage pressures in recent years related to the cost of labor at our third-party manufacturers, at our distribution centers and at our stores. For example, recent government initiatives in the U.S. or changes to existing laws, such as the adoption and implementation of national, state, or local government proposals relating to increases in minimum wage rates, may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations. We may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher labor costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations.\nWe primarily used four contract carriers to ship merchandise and related materials to our North American customers, and several contract carriers for our international customers. If the shipping operations of these third-parties were disrupted, and we are\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 20\n2021 Form 10-K\nunable to respond in a quick and efficient manner, our ability to replace inventory in our stores and process digital and third-party orders could be interrupted, potentially resulting in adverse impacts to sales or increased costs.\nIn addition, there continues to be global uncertainty, such as to the on-going hostilities in Ukraine, the ultimate impact of uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, and similar events of global, political unrest. These events have increased global uncertainty and have impacted and may in the future impact the cost, availability and quality of merchandise, as well as the cost, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise.\nIn addition, compliance with the recent sanctions and customs trade orders issued by the U.S. government related to the on-going hostilities in Ukraine, entities and individuals who are connected to the China\u2019s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, could affect the global supply chain and the price of cotton in the marketplace. We may face regulatory challenges in complying with applicable sanctions and trade regulations and reputational challenges with our consumers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the material sourced.\nWe may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher raw materials prices or labor or transportation costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations. Such factors listed above may be exacerbated by legislation and regulations associated with global trade policies and climate change.\nWe depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture and delivery of all our merchandise, and a disruption of the manufacture or delivery of our merchandise could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. As a result, the continued success of our operations is tied to our timely receipt of quality merchandise from third-party manufacturers. We source the majority of our merchandise outside of the U.S. through arrangements with approximately 114 vendors, primarily located in southeast Asia. Political, social or economic instability in the regions in which our manufacturers are located could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the U.S. In addition, the inability of vendors to access liquidity, or the insolvency of vendors, could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise to us. A manufacturer\u2019s inability to ship orders in a timely manner or meet our quality standards could cause delays in responding to consumer demand and negatively affect consumer confidence or negatively impact our competitive position, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAll factories that we partner with are contractually required to adhere to the Company\u2019s Vendor Code of Conduct, go through social audits which include on-site walk-throughs to appraise the physical working conditions and health and safety practices, and review payroll and age documentation. If our factories are unwilling or not able to meet the standards set forth within the Company\u2019s Vendor Code of Conduct, it could limit the options available to us and could result in an increase of costs of manufacturing, which we may not able to pass on to our customers.\nOther events that could disrupt the timely delivery of our merchandise include new trade law provisions or regulations, reliance on a limited number of shipping carriers and associated alliances, weather events, significant labor disputes, port congestion and other unexpected events, such as COVID-19. Furthermore, we are susceptible to increases in fuel costs which may increase the cost of distribution. If we are not able to pass this cost on to our customers, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the experience and skills of our executive officers and associates, and the failure to attract or retain this talent, effectively manage succession, and establish a diverse workforce could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to succeed may be adversely impacted if we are not able to attract, retain and develop talent and future leaders, including our executive officers. We believe that the attraction,\u202fretention\u202fand management of qualified talent is integral to our success in advancing our strategies and key business priorities and avoiding disruptions in our business. We rely on our associates across the organization, including those at\u202four\u202fcorporate offices,\u202fstores\u202fand distribution centers, as well as their experience and expertise in the retail business.\u202f\u202f\nOur executive officers closely supervise all aspects of our operations, including the design of our merchandise, have substantial experience and expertise in the retail business and have an integral role in the growth and success of our brands. If we were to lose the benefit of the involvement of executives or other personnel, without adequate succession plans, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if we are unable to attract and retain talent at the associate level without adequate succession plans, our business could be adversely impacted as competition for such qualified talent is intense, and we cannot be sure we will be able to attract, retain and develop a sufficient number of qualified individuals in future periods. For example, as automation, artificial intelligence and similar technological advancements continue to evolve, we may need to compete for talent that is familiar with these advancements in technologies in order to compete effectively with our industry peers. If we are not successful in these efforts, our business may be adversely affected.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 21\n2021 Form 10-K\nIf we are not successful in these efforts or fail to successfully execute against the key initiatives that are focused on attracting, retaining and managing our human capital resources listed in \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS,\u201d our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, fail to remediate a material weaknesses, or fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe effectiveness of any controls or procedures is subject to certain inherent limitations, and as a result, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent or detect misstatements. Even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIf we fail to remediate a material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, management could be required to expend significant resources and we could fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, and be subject to fines, penalties, investigations or judgements, all of which could negatively affect investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nLEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales, consumption or value-added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d) in many jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits. At any time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or losses by taxing jurisdictions or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Fluctuations in duties could also have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn some international markets, we are required to hold and submit VAT to the appropriate local tax authorities. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the appropriate amounts could subject us to substantial fines and penalties that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, along with members of its inclusive framework, have through the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These proposals, if finalized and adopted by the associated countries, will likely increase tax complexity, and may both create uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nIn the U.S. the Administration along with some members in Congress have made various tax proposals including an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, an increase in the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a minimum tax on worldwide book income, changes to the deductibility of interest, among other proposals. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact to our effective tax rate.\nIn the past, tax law has been enacted, domestically and abroad, impacting our current or future tax structure and effective tax rate, such as the Swiss Tax Reform discussed further in Note 12, \u201cINCOME TAXES.\u201d Tax law may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that impacts our current or future tax structure and effective tax rate.\nOur litigation and stockholder activism, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe, along with third parties we do business with, are involved, from time to time, in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters may include, but are not limited to, contract disputes, employment-related actions, labor relations, commercial litigation, intellectual property rights, product safety, environmental matters and shareholder actions.\nLitigation, in general, may be expensive and disruptive. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations and, depending on the nature of the allegations, could negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, defending against these legal proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 22\n2021 Form 10-K\nStockholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, remains popular with many public investors. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or stockholder activism. Responding to stockholder activists campaigns may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources without yielding any improvement in our results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe our core trademarks, Abercrombie & Fitch\u00ae, abercrombie\u00ae, Hollister\u00ae, Gilly Hicks\u00ae, Social Tourist\u00ae and the \u201cMoose\u201d and \u201cSeagull\u201d logos, are essential to the effective implementation of our strategy. We have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the registries of countries in key markets within the Company\u2019s sales and distribution channels. In addition, these trademarks are either registered, or the Company has applications for registration pending, with the registries of many of the foreign countries in which the manufacturers of the Company\u2019s products are located. There can be no assurance that we will obtain registrations that have been applied for or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. Although brand security initiatives are in place, we cannot guarantee that our efforts against the counterfeiting of our brands will be successful. If a third party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand image could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we source or offer our merchandise now, or may in the future, our international expansion and our merchandising of products using these marks could be limited. The pending applications for international registration of various trademarks could be challenged or rejected in those countries because third parties of whom we are not currently aware have already registered similar marks in those countries. Accordingly, it may be possible, in those foreign countries where the status of various applications is pending or unclear, for a third-party owner of the national trademark registration for a similar mark to prohibit the manufacture, sale or exportation of branded goods in or from that country. Failure to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use our trademarks or logos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to obtain supplies from, or manufacture in, less costly markets or penetrate new markets should our business plan include selling our merchandise in those non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, if a third party claims to have licensing rights with respect to merchandise we have produced or purchased from a vendor, we may be obligated to remove this merchandise from our inventory offering and incur related costs, and could be subject to liability under various civil and criminal causes of action, including actions to recover unpaid royalties and other damages.\nChanges in the regulatory or compliance landscape could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including customs, truth-in-advertising, securities laws, consumer protection, general privacy, health information privacy, identity theft, online privacy, general employment laws, employee health and safety, minimum wage laws, unsolicited commercial communication and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, intellectual property, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores, digital operations and distribution centers. If these laws and regulations were to change, or were violated by our management, associates, suppliers, vendors or other parties with whom we do business, the costs of certain merchandise could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our merchandise, be subject to fines or penalties, temporary or permanent store closures, increased regulatory scrutiny or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation including the areas referenced above, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations at the local, state, federal and various international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. Changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, or environmental protection, among others, may result in increased compliance costs for us and our business partners.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of regulatory, reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, those related to corporate governance and public disclosure. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, financial reform legislation, government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations. New requirements or changes in current regulatory reporting requirements may introduce additional complexities, lead to additional compliance costs, divert management\u2019s time and attention from strategic business activities, and could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in fines, penalties, or lawsuits and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 23\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe agreements related to our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured notes include restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business and our inability to obtain credit on reasonable terms in the future could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement, as amended (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d), expires on April 29, 2026 and our senior secured notes, which have a fixed 8.75% interest rate, will mature on July 15, 2025 (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d). Both our ABL Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes contain restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exemptions, restrict, among other things, the following: our ability to incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; grant or incur liens; sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; make investments in certain subsidiaries; pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock; redeem or repurchase capital stock; change the nature of our business; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity.\nIf an event of default occurs, any outstanding obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Facility could be declared immediately due and payable or the lenders could foreclose on or exercise other remedies with respect to the assets securing the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Facility. In addition, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes and ABL Facility are secured by certain of our real property, inventory, intellectual property, general intangibles and receivables, among other things, and lenders may exercise remedies against the collateral in the event of our default.\nWe have, and expect to continue to have, a level of indebtedness. In addition, we may, from time to time, incur additional indebtedness. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness before maturity, including the Senior Secured Notes, and any indebtedness under the ABL Facility. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Changes in market conditions could potentially impact the size and terms of a replacement facility or facilities in the future. The inability to obtain credit on commercially reasonable terms in the future could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations as well as limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. 24\n2021 Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 83976, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "ANF"}
