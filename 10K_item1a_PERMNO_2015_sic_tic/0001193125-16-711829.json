RISK FACTORS\nBecause we intend to continue to originate commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans, our credit risk may increase, and continued downturns in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe intend to continue originating commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans. At June 30, 2016, $119.6 million, or 26.6%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans, $84.2 million, or 18.8%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of multi-family loans, and $57.8 million, or 12.9%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans. These categories of loans have increased significantly since June 30, 2009, when $23.8 million, or 10.5%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans, $14.8 million, or 6.6%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of multi-family loans, and $9.3 million, or 4.1%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans. We expect each of these loan categories to continue to increase as a percentage of our total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, a downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. As our commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nIf our non-performing loans and other non-performing assets increase, our earnings will decrease.\nAt June 30, 2016, our non-performing assets (which consist of non-accrual loans, loans 90 days or more delinquent, and real estate owned) totaled $2.5 million. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans, and we must establish reserves or take charge-offs for probable losses on non-performing loans. Reserves are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses. There are also legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets. Additionally, our real estate owned results in carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance fees. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract us from the overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of Iroquois Federal. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly by recording a provision for loan losses.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nOur customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral, if any, securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We may experience significant loan losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable losses in our loan portfolio, requiring us to make additions to our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses was 1.19% of total loans at June 30, 2016. Additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted Accounting Standard Update 2016-13, which will be effective for IF Bancorp and Iroquois Federal for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. This standard, often referred to as \u201cCECL\u201d (reflecting a current expected credit loss model), will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of losses expected to be realized over the contractual lives of the loans. Under current U.S. GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses only when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date. This new standard will require us to collect and review increased types and amounts of data for us to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits.\nOur profitability largely depends on our net interest income, which can be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between:\n\u2022\nthe interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\nthe interest expense we incur on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe interest rates on our loans are generally fixed for a longer period of time than the interest rates on our deposits. Like many savings institutions, our focus on deposits as a source of funds, which either have no stated maturity or shorter contractual maturities than mortgage loans, results in our liabilities having a shorter average duration than our assets. For example, as of June 30, 2016, 39.1% of our loans had remaining maturities of, or reprice after, 5 years or longer, while 59.5% of our certificates of deposit had remaining maturities of, or reprice in, one year or less. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest we earn on our assets, such as loans and investments, may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities, such as deposits. In a period of declining market interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest expense we incur on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called or prepaid, thereby requiring us to reinvest these cash flows at lower interest rates. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A decline in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity using a model that estimates the change in our net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios, also known as a \u201crate shock\u201d analysis. Net portfolio value is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nDuring the past several years it has been the policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at lower levels than as available prior to 2009. Consequently, the average yield on our\ninterest earning assets has decreased to 3.71% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 5.29% for the year ended June 30, 2009. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets. This has resulted in increases in net interest income in the short term. However, our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. Accordingly, our net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) may decrease, which may have an adverse affect on our profitability.\nThe State of Illinois has significant financial difficulties, and this could adversely impact certain of our borrowers and the economic vitality of the state, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nThe State of Illinois has significant financial difficulties, including material pension funding shortfalls. The State of Illinois\u2019 debt rating has been downgraded and its executive and legislative branches of government have been unable to reach agreement on a budget for the current fiscal year. These issues could impact the economic vitality of the state and the businesses operating there, encourage businesses to leave the State of Illinois, discourage new employers from starting or moving businesses to the state, and could result in an increase in the Illinois state income tax rate. In addition, population outflow from the State of Illinois could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nSome of the markets we are in include significant university and healthcare presence, which rely heavily on state funding and contracts. Payment delays by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have significant, negative effects on our markets, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, adverse changes in agribusiness and capital goods exports could materially adversely affect downstate Illinois markets, which are heavily reliant upon these industries. Delays in the payment of accounts receivable owed to borrowers that are employed by or who do business with these industries or the State of Illinois could impair their ability to repay their loans when due and negatively impact our business.\nIncreased interest rates and changes in secondary mortgage market conditions could reduce our earnings from our mortgage banking operations.\nOur mortgage banking income varies with movements in interest rates, and increases in interest rates could negatively affect our ability to originate loans in the same volume as we have in past years. In addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. In light of current conditions, there is greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce our loan mortgage production volume and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our loan portfolio consists of loan participations secured by properties outside of our primary market area. Loan participations may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we are not the lead lender and we have limited control over credit monitoring.\nWe occasionally purchase loan participations secured by properties outside of our primary market area in which we are not the lead lender. Although we underwrite these loan participations consistent with our general underwriting criteria, loan participations may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we rely on the lead lender to monitor the performance of the loan. Moreover, our decision regarding the classification of a loan participation and loan loss provisions associated with a loan participation is made in part based upon information provided by the lead lender. A lead lender also may not monitor a participation loan in the same manner as we would for loans that we originate. At June 30, 2016, our loan participations totaled $47.7 million, or 10.6% of our gross loans, most of which are within 100 miles of our primary lending market and consist primarily of multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial loans.\nAdditionally, we expect to continue to use loan participations as a way to effectively deploy our capital. If our underwriting of these participation loans is not sufficient, our non-performing loans may increase and our earnings may decrease.\nWe have in the past purchased loans originated by other banks and mortgage companies, some of which have experienced a higher rate of losses than loans that we originate. If we continue to experience losses on these loans, our earnings will decrease.\nIn addition to loans that we originate, at June 30, 2016, our loan portfolio included $9.8 million of purchased loans. These loans were primarily purchased from three vendors: Irwin Mortgage Corporation (now serviced by the Association); Mid America Bank (now serviced by PNC Bank); and Countrywide Financial (now serviced by Bank of America). Of these loans, $2.6 million were purchased from Countrywide and have experienced a significantly higher rate of losses than loans that we originate. As of June 30, 2016, the loans purchased from Countrywide consisted of 6 loans secured by one- to four-family residential loans, primarily in the Chicago market area. Of these 6 loans, 3 are classified as substandard and have specific allowances of $4,000. The other 3 loans are performing in accordance with their original terms. If we experience additional losses on these loans, our earnings will decrease.\nGovernment responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for savings associations and savings and loan holding companies, subject to a transition period. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. Ongoing uncertainty and adverse developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets, and the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulatory actions, may adversely affect our operations by restricting our business activities, including our ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Federal regulations govern the activities in which we may engage, and are primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operations of a savings association, the classification of assets by a savings association, and the adequacy of a savings association\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations or legislation, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. Any legislative, regulatory or policy changes adopted in the future could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects. Further, we expect any such new laws, rules or regulations will add to our compliance costs and place additional demands on our management team.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and capital rules is uncertain.\nIn July, 2013, the federal banking agencies approved a rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Iroquois Federal and If Bancorp. The rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe amended capital requirements include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective for Iroquois Federal and IF Bancorp on January 1, 2015, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The new rule also\nestablished a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Iroquois Federal and IF Bancorp could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions such as the inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage brokerage firms, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and/or suffer damage to our reputation.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nWe regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial and other transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of popular financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses.\nIf this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss.\nAlthough we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of information does occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to confirm the third party\u2019s compliance with the terms of the agreement. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failures, interruptions, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 12920, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "IROQ"}
