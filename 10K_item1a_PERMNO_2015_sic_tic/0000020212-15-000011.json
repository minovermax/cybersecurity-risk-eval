The factors described below are the most significant risks that could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic trends may impact our operations\nEconomic conditions improved during 2013 and 2014 from a previous period of adverse conditions in local, regional, national and global markets, however there remains risk that a downturn may resume. Our access to, or cost of, credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward trends. Additionally, our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase, when revenues decline. Accordingly, any persistence of poor economic conditions, or further deterioration, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to consumer confidence and reductions in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, which may result from the challenging economic conditions, unemployment levels and other changes we cannot accurately predict\nDemand for entertainment and leisure activities is sensitive to consumers\u2019 disposable incomes, which have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment. Further declines in the residential real estate market, changes in consumer confidence, increases in individual tax rates, and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers. This could result in fewer patrons visiting our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities, online wagering sites and our casual gaming site, or downloading our casual games, and/or may impact our customers\u2019 ability to wager with the same frequency and maintain their wagering level profiles. Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if it occurs in other markets. For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers. Accordingly, any significant loss of customers or decline in wagering could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and fees\nWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Moreover, many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of any such changes in tax laws or fee increases, or their administration; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business\nOur debt facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nWe have pledged and will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities. If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could proceed against the collateral we have granted them.\nUnder our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or the existing agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:\n\u2022\nwill not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.\nIf the indebtedness under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nWe may not be able to identify and complete acquisition, expansion or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as planned\nWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations.\nWe could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects. The integration of new operations and any other properties we may acquire or develop will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of integrating new properties or projects may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers. Furthermore, current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues. We cannot assure that any new properties or developments will be completed or integrated successfully.\nManagement of new properties or business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources. We cannot assure that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or developments.\nWe may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operations\nWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future. The successful integration of newly acquired businesses, including our recent acquisitions of Big Fish Games and Oxford, into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns. We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all. Furthermore, the costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results. These costs could include:\n\u2022\nrestructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nnon-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and\n\u2022\ncosts of imposing financial and management controls (such as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and operating, administrative and information systems.\nAlthough we perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations. In any acquisition we make, we face risks which include:\n\u2022\nthe risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;\n\u2022\nthe potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;\n\u2022\ncosts and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;\n\u2022\nthe risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees or customers;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nchanges to legal and regulatory guidelines, which may negatively affect acquisitions.\nIf we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy is premised, in part, on the legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and our ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization\nIn the last few years, Delaware, Nevada, California, Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Washington D.C. and the Federal government have considered legislation that would legalize online real money gaming. To date, only Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted such legislation. If a large number of additional states or the Federal government enact online real money gaming legislation and we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses to operate online real money gaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in real money gaming could be materially impaired. In addition, states or the Federal government may legalize online real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us. For example, several states and the Federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction. There also exists in the online real money gaming industry a significant \u201cfirst mover\u201d advantage. Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online real money gaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors. Failing to do so (\u201cmove first\u201d) could materially impair our ability to grow in the online real money gaming space. In addition to the risk that online real money gaming will be legalized in a manner unfavorable to us, we may fail to accurately predict when online real money gaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each state and at the Federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online real money gaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online real money gaming offerings in such jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon their geographic location, may result in legal penalties or an impairment to our ability to offer online real money gaming, in general\nIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online real money gaming products. While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal engage our online real money gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online real money gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us, and therefore our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. For example, gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online real money gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online real money gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal. Furthermore, our inability to restrict illegal access could materially impact our other gaming licenses as well.\nWe may adversely infringe on the intellectual property rights of others\nIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties. Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future. We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products. Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of our products and services if we become subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement.\nOur results may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation surrounding it has the effect of increasing the risks associated with certain of our product offerings, particularly in the areas of advance deposit wagering, or ADW, and casual gaming. There can be no assurance that we would not become a party to litigation surrounding our ADW or casual gaming businesses or that such litigation would not cause us to suffer losses or disruption in our business strategy.\nWe are susceptible to unauthorized disclosure of our source code\nWe may not be able to protect our computer source code from being copied if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality; which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks.\nWe depend on key personnel\nOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team including Robert L. Evans, our Chairman of the Board, and William C. Carstanjen, our Chief Executive Officer. We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us, and their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other companies. In addition, certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship. Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impair our operations. Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operations\nA disruption or failure in our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas. For example, Churchill Downs, Harlow\u2019s, Riverwalk, Fair Grounds and its related OTBs and Calder could all be adversely affected by flooding or hurricanes. Furthermore, our TwinSpires and Big Fish Games locations may be affected by earthquakes. While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, our coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters. If any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of natural disasters in the future, or if natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, the disruption could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we have \u201call risk\u201d property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions. Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nOur debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions. A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future.\nWe process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business\nWe receive, store and process personal information and other customer data. There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. While the Company maintains insurance coverage specific to cyber-insurance matters, any failure on our part to maintain adequate safeguards may subject us to significant liabilities. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\nIn the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California\u2019s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.\nImproper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm to our reputation\nWe store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, contact preferences and payment account information. For example, we store personal information from TwinSpires.com account holders, from our gaming customers\u2019 rewards accounts and from ticket sales at our racetracks. It is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nOur business is subject to online security risk, including security breaches\nWe store and transmit users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and be exposed to litigation or potential liability for us. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nSystem failures or damage from earthquakes, fires, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attack or other unforeseen events could harm our business\nOur ADW and casual gaming businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware. We have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage; however, certain risks still exist. Thus, our systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website\nand our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue. Interruptions in our services or a breach of customers\u2019 secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site, and could permanently harm our reputation and brand. These interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our games. We have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems. However, this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry. Many companies, including ours, have been the target of such attacks. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.\nWe carry insurance covering many of these risks, including network security, first party extortion threats and business interruptions, but there are certain exclusions to this coverage and the insurance limits may not be sufficient to fully mitigate all financial damage to the Company. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfaction\nThe gaming sector is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products. Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network. However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources. Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features. While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner. Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, which could have adverse effects on our business or results of operations due to chargebacks from customers\nWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (\u201cEFT\u201d), and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit, debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse their online gaming losses through chargebacks. Although we place great emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks, these control procedures may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on us\nWe are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any violation of FCPA regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customers\nThe integrity of the horseracing, gaming and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large. To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated. A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could significantly lower attendance, amounts wagered and reduce revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Racing Business\nOur racing operations are highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business\nOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana and Florida. To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks. However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses. The failure to attain, loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business. For example, in Illinois the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as \u201chost track\u201d for the purpose of receiving host track revenues generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races. Racetracks that are designated as \u201chost track\u201d obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois. Under Illinois law, the \u201chost track\u201d is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari-mutuel wagering. Should Arlington cease to be a \u201chost track\u201d during this period, the loss of hosting revenues could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenues monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington\u2019s purse account. These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and their reduction or elimination could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic trends specific to the horse racing industry are unfavorable\nHorseracing and related activities, as well as the gaming services we provide, are similar to other leisure activities in that they represent discretionary expenditures likely to decline during economic downturns. In some cases, even the perception of an impending economic downturn or the continuation of a recessionary climate can be enough to discourage consumers from spending on leisure activities. These economic trends can impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $1.1 million of bad debt expense, net of purses, resulting from the bankruptcy filing of New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation. We will continue to closely monitor participants\u2019 operational viability within the industry and any related collection issues which could potentially have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increase\nAll of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we expect the number of competitors to increase. See subheading \u201cK. Competition\u201d in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of racing industry competition.\nAll of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market. Approximately 41,280 thoroughbred horse races are conducted annually in the United States. Of these races, we host approximately 3,030 races each year, or about 7.3% of the total. As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races. As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races. In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines, at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.\nCompetition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business. Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both their continued operations and expansion. Our racing business also faces significantly greater costs in operating our racing business compared to costs borne by these gaming companies. Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-\nbased gaming companies. Many online and web-based gaming companies are based off-shore and avoid regulation under U.S. state and federal laws. These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks. Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe popularity of horse racing is declining\nThere has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives as discussed above. According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined 27% from 2007 to 2011 and has been relatively stable since experiencing a cumulative decline of approximately 2% between 2011 and 2014. We believe lower interest in racing may have a negative impact on revenues and profitability in our racing business, as well as our ADW business, which is dependent on racing content provided by our racing business and other track operators. Our business plan anticipates that we will attract new customers to our racetracks, OTBs and ADW operations. A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, or a continued generalized decline in interest in racing, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur racing business is geographically concentrated and experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating results\nWe conduct our racing business at three racetracks: Churchill Downs, Fair Grounds and Arlington. A significant portion of our racing revenues are generated by two events, the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks. If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Derby or Kentucky Oaks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors. We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year. The number of live racing days we are able to offer directly affects our results of operations. A significant decrease in the number of live racing days and/or live races offered during our Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks week could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseraces\nWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields. A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces. Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors. It depends on our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and it also depends on the overall horse population available for racing. Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases such as the neurologic form of Equine Herpes Virus-I and Strangles. If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it would have a material impact on our profitability. Finally, if we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease.\nWe also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenues for race purses and capital improvements. For example, Churchill Downs and Arlington are experiencing heightened competition from racinos in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenues. The opening of the Genting New York Resort at Aqueduct racetrack has enhanced the purse structure at New York racetracks as compared to historical levels. Ohio has authorized four land-based casinos by voter referendum and video lottery terminals at seven Ohio racetracks through executive order. Our failure to attract full fields could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racing\nSince horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering. Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties. If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks\nThe IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the \u201cHorsemen\u2019s Groups\u201d). These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen\u2019s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races. In addition, the agreements between other racetracks and their Horsemen\u2019s Groups typically provide that those racetracks must receive consent from the Horsemen\u2019s Groups before we can accept wagers on their races. For example, from time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen\u2019s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the \u201cFHBPA\u201d) which represents horsemen in Florida and the Kentucky Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association (\u201cKHBPA\u201d) have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks. Further, the IHA and various state laws require that we have written agreements with Horsemen\u2019s Groups at our racetracks in order to simulcast races on an export basis. In addition, our simulcasting agreements are generally subject to the consent of these Horsemen\u2019s Groups. Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen\u2019s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also have written agreements with the Horsemen\u2019s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida. Florida law requires Calder Casino to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association (the \u201cFTBOA\u201d) governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machines gaming to breeders\u2019, stallion, and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming.\nIt is not certain that we will be able to maintain agreements with, or to obtain required consent from, Horsemen\u2019s Groups. We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen\u2019s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis. The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, our horsemen on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen\u2019s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties\u2019 races could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks\u2019 signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks\u2019 facilities. From time to time, we are unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks\u2019 racing content for wagering at our racetracks. The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHorse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigation\nAlthough we carry jockey accident insurance at each of our racetracks to cover personal jockey injuries which may occur during races or daily workouts, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nOwnership and development of real estate requires significant expenditures and is subject to risk\nOur racing operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings. All real estate investments are subject to risks including: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants. The real estate industry is also capital intensive and sensitive to interest rates. Further, significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property, which expenditures negatively impact our operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination. If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.\nOur business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator services\nOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces. The failure to\nkeep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product. A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing. In addition, a totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.\nUnited Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses. Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner. Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Casino Business\nOur gaming business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business\nOur gaming operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to continue to operate or to expand our gaming operations.\nRegulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines and loss limits. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy.\nOur gaming business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increase\nOur gaming operations operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources. The gaming industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Our gaming operations also face competition from Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We do not enjoy the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them. Additionally, web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified. We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry. In addition, Florida legislators continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos. Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See subheading \u201cK. Competition\u201d in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of gaming industry competition.\nOur gaming business is geographically concentrated\nWe conduct our gaming business at six principal locations: Oxford in Oxford, Maine, Riverwalk in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Harlow\u2019s in Greenville, Mississippi, Calder Casino in Miami Gardens, Florida, Fair Grounds Slots in New Orleans, Louisiana, and at our joint venture, Miami Valley Gaming and Racing in Lebanon, Ohio. We also operate video poker machines throughout Louisiana through our subsidiary, VSI. If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our principal gaming operations, or if economic or regulatory conditions were to become unfavorable in one or more of the regions in which they operate, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe development of new gaming venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertainties\nThe Company may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise. Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us\nThe majority of our gaming revenues are attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities. It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests. In recent years, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. In recent years, for example, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.\nWe materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.\nRisks Related to Our TwinSpires Business\nOur ADW business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business\nTwinSpires, our ADW business, accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet at TwinSpires.com. The ADW business is heavily regulated, and laws governing advance deposit wagering vary from state to state. Some states have expressly authorized advance deposit wagering by their own residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or advance deposit wagering and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited their residents from placing wagers through advance deposit wagering hubs located in different states. We believe that an ADW business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions. However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state gaming laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do. In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate advance deposit wagering.\nOur expansion opportunities with respect to advance deposit wagering may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit advance deposit wagering. Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make advance deposit wagering expressly unlawful, this could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, previously existing ADW regulations in Illinois expired on December 31, 2012, and we ceased accepting wagers from Illinois residents in January 2013 until June 2013, when Illinois ADW regulations were extended. Furthermore, we ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013, due to the enforcement of an existing Texas law prohibiting ADW wagering. In addition, the regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain. We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our ADW business. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for advance deposit wagering.\nFurthermore, many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations, which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states. Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies. Such effects could have a material, adverse impact to the success of our advance deposit wagering operations.\nOur ADW business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online\nservices for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nIt is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online gaming and impair our business.\nOur ADW business faces strong competition, and we expect competition levels to increase\nOur ADW business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses. Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our ADW business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses. In addition, we face competition from a new wagering product called exchange wagering, a variation of pari-mutuel wagering in which bettors wager directly against one another, establishing their own odds on a horserace. Both California and New Jersey legislatures have approved exchange wagering. Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do. In addition, we believe that new competitors may enter the ADW business with relative ease because of the low cost of entry. As a result, we anticipate increased competition in our ADW business. It is difficult to predict the impact of increased competition on our ADW business. See subheading \u201cK. Competition\u201d in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of ADW industry competition.\nA clarification on the impact of the Federal Wire Act of 1961 on Internet gaming could increase competition\nDuring 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice clarified its position on the Wire Act of 1961 (the \u201cWire Act\u201d), which had historically been interpreted to outlaw all forms of gambling across states lines. The department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Wire Act applied only to a sporting event or contest, but did not apply to other forms of Internet gambling, including online betting unrelated to sporting events. The Justice Department indicated that many forms of online gambling could become legal under federal law, which could include legalized poker and generalized gaming including state lottery wagering. As a result, we anticipate increased competition to our ADW business from various other forms of online gaming. It is difficult to predict the level of increased competition and the impact of increased competition on our ADW business.\nOur inability to retain our core customer base or our failure to attract new customers could harm our business\nWe utilize technology and marketing relationships to retain current customers and attract new customers. If we are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features, if we lose customers to our competitors, or if we fail to attract new customers, our businesses would fail to grow or would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Big Fish Games\nWe operate in an evolving and highly competitive market segment\nThe market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. The business of developing, distributing and marketing downloadable and mobile games is characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging platforms and technologies. We compete with other game developers and content providers for the leisure time, attention, and discretionary spending of our players based on a number of factors, including game design, brand and consumer reviews, quality of gameplay experience and access to distribution channels. We also compete with other content providers to acquire rights to game properties developed or licensed by third parties, including with respect to royalty and other economic terms, porting and localization abilities, speed of execution and distribution capabilities and breadth.\nMany of our primary competitors have dedicated greater financial, marketing and other resources to the development, distribution and promotion of their games. In addition, given the open nature of the development process and relatively low barriers to entry,\nwe are also faced with competition from a vast number of small, independent developers that have access to the same third party platforms as we do to market and distribute their titles.\nThe competitive landscape is further complicated by frequent shifts and advancements in free-to-play games for smartphones, tablets and other next-generation platforms. Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and in-game offers that generate revenue for us. Our efforts to develop free-to-play games may prove unsuccessful or, even if successful, may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenues because, among other reasons:\n\u2022\nfree-to-play games have a relatively limited history, and it is unclear how popular this style of game will become or remain, or its future revenue potential;\n\u2022\nour free-to-play strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because they are free, and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games. However, players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons, including poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity, ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts, lack of sufficient community features, lack of prominent featuring on the platforms where they are marketed, or our inability to add or update engaging content on a relatively frequent basis;\n\u2022\neven if our free-to-play games are widely downloaded, a significant portion of the revenues generated from these titles are derived from a relatively small concentration of players and we may fail to retain these or other users, or optimize the monetization of these games, for a variety of reasons, including game design or quality, lack of community features, or adequate customer support, gameplay issues such as game unavailability, long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues, our inability to add or updated engaging content on a relatively frequent basis, or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates;\n\u2022\nthe billing and other capabilities of some smartphones and tablets are currently not optimized to enable users to purchase games or make in-app purchases, which may make it difficult for users of these devices to purchase our games or make in-app purchases, and could reduce our addressable customer base, at least in the short term; and\n\u2022\nthe Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors, and the Commission might issue rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases.\nWe derive material revenues from distribution of our titles through third party mobile platforms, and if we are unable to maintain relationships with the owners of these platforms or if our access to these platforms was limited or unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business could be adversely affected\nIf we are unable to maintain good relationships with third party mobile platform providers, such as Apple and Google, or our access to these platforms was limited or suspended based on any change in terms or policies that made the continued distribution of our titles on these platforms unfeasible or less profitable, or that required us to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns or other means to enhance the discoverability of our titles on these platforms, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur ability to transact business through these platforms is subject to our compliance with their standard terms and conditions, which may be unilaterally amended at any time. For example, the owners of these platforms set the revenue share they are entitled to receive, and may change that without input from or advance notice to us. In addition, the standard terms and conditions of these platforms may impose restrictions on the types of content they will allow to be sold, the ways in which the content is offered and promoted, and the process and timing of accepting content for distribution. Such restrictions could impair our ability to successfully market and sell our mobile games. Furthermore, if any of the providers of these platforms determines that we are in violation of their standard terms and conditions, we may be prohibited from distributing our titles through these platforms, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely on the ongoing availability of these platforms. If they experience prolonged periods of unavailability, it could have a material impact on our ability to generate revenue through these platforms, and our business and operating results could be harmed. In addition, if these platforms fail to provide adequate levels of service, our customers' ability to access our games may be impacted, or customers may not receive any virtual items for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand and consumer good will.\nIf we fail to develop and publish mobile games that achieve market acceptance, or continue to enhance our existing games, our revenues may suffer\nOur business depends on developing and publishing free-to-play and premium paid casual and mobile games that consumers will download and spend time and money on consistently. We continue to invest significant resources in research and\ndevelopment, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and update our existing titles. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing games and other forms of entertainment, and the emergence of new platforms. If our games do not meet consumer expectations, or they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Furthermore, even if our games are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a failure to continue to update them with compelling content or any shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers could materially impact our operating results.\nIf the use of smartphones and tablet devices to facilitate game platforms generally does not increase, our business could be adversely affected\nWhile the number of people using mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years, the mobile market, particularly the market for mobile games, is still emerging and it may not grow as rapidly or robustly as we anticipate. Our future success is partially dependent upon the continued growth and application of mobile devices for games. In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which some of our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms.\nIf we are unable to secure new or ongoing content from third party development partners on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affected\nIn addition to the games we develop internally, we acquire or license games, including some of our most successful games, from third party development partners located around the world. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented and reliable development partners to source new content and update existing content. Our agreements with these development partners are in some instances not exclusive to us and will expire at various times. If we are unable to renew these agreements on terms favorable to us or at all, or if our development partners enter into similar agreements with our competitors or choose to publish their own titles, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition, certain of our development partners are located in geographic regions of the world that continue to experience military and insurgency conflict, and political turmoil and unrest. Any of these factors could impact the ability of these development partners to create and deliver content to us in a timely fashion or at all, and could restrict or prohibit our ability to remit payments to these development partners. If we are unable to deliver compelling content to our customers or update existing content based on these occurrences, our ongoing business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf our games contain programming errors or flaws, if a significant number of customers experience technical difficulties downloading or launching our games, or if we fail to continue to provide our customers with a high-quality customer experience, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and impair our ability to successfully execute our business strategy.\nA critical component of our strategy is providing a high-quality customer experience to our customers. Our games may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after their launch, particularly as we launch new games under tight time constraints. Porting games to new devices or languages may also result in the creation of errors that did not exist in the game as originally released. In addition, our customers may experience technical difficulties downloading and launching our games due to the effects of third-party software on their computers, which we do not control. We cannot provide assurances that our customer service team can resolve these types of technical difficulties, and if a significant number of our customers cannot download or launch our games, it would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that if our customers have a negative experience with our games, they may be less inclined to continue or resume playing our games or recommend our games to other potential customers. Undetected programming errors, game defects, data corruption and issues with third-party software can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the game experience of our customers, harm our reputation, cause our customers to stop playing our games and divert our resources, any of which could result in legal liability to us or harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our games. Other intellectual property that we create includes audio-visual elements, such as graphics, music and storylines. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights. If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brand and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWhile we believe that our issued patents or pending patent applications help to protect our business, we cannot assure you that our products, services or operations do not, or will not, infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties, or that competitors will not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications. In addition, we\ncannot assure you that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, we rely on intellectual property and technology developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\nEffective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our games and other products and services may be provided. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use, which could harm our competitive position. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity. To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed\nWe believe that our success depends in part on our highly-skilled employee base, and our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization. This includes software developers and engineers, IT staff, game designers and producers, marketing specialists, analytics professionals, and customer service staff. If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be impaired, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCompetition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly-skilled employees. We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.\nAll of our officers and other employees in the United States are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. In addition, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay the development and distribution of, and impair our ability to sell, our games and other products and services, harm our reputation and impair our ability to execute our business plans.\n\u201cCheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other actions by third parties that seek to exploit our games and our players may affect our reputation and harm our operating results\nThird parties have developed, and may continue to develop, \u201ccheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that could decrease the revenues we generate from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us. Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain virtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players. In addition, third parties may attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. We devote significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so quickly or effectively, it could damage our reputation and impact our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79026, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CHDN"}
