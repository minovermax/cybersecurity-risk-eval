{"cik": "1108134", "company": "BERKSHIRE HILLS BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nLending\nDeterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\nReal estate lending is a major business activity for the Company. Real estate market conditions affect the value and marketability of real estate collateral, and they also affect the cash flows, liquidity, and net worth of many borrowers whose operations and finances depend on real estate market conditions. Adverse conditions in the Company's market areas could reduce growth rates, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, and generally affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Potential increases in interest rates could increase capitalization rates which could adversely affect commercial property appraisals and collateral value.\nThe Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\nThe Company emphasizes commercial lending, which generally exposes the Company to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Commercial loans are historically more susceptible to delinquency, default, and loss during economic downturns. Commercial lending involves larger loan sizes and larger relationship exposures, with greater potential impact on profits in the event of adverse loan performance. The majority of the Company\u2019s commercial loans are secured by real estate and subject to the previously discussed real estate risk factors, as well as risks specific to individual properties and property types. Geographic expansion may result in new risks not identified by the Company or which it is unfamiliar with monitoring or resolving. Recent expansion has been focused on the Greater Boston market, where the Bank may be financing projects with larger loan amounts and where the Bank has less experience than in its traditional market areas and where competition may result in different lending structures.\nIn 2019, the Company wrote-off the $16 million balance of a secured commercial loan in circumstances involving alleged borrower fraud. Commercial lending activities pose higher risk of fraud, as in this situation. This asset was a participating interest in a commercial loan managed by another financial institution. Such participating interests involve risks related to counterparty performance, as further described in a later risk factor. In the case of this loan, the Company has filed legal claims against the lead lender in pursuit of the recovery of some of the loss recorded by the Company. The outcome of such legal proceedings is subject to uncertainty and the Company has not recognized any such potential recoveries in its financial records.\nThe Company is Subject to a Variety of Risks in Connection With Any Sale of Loans it May Conduct.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s sale of one or more loan portfolios, it may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are invalid, the Company may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or it may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans, which may be impaired. The Company may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan it has sold. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain seller/servicer relationships with government agencies and government backed entities may be jeopardized in the event of the emergence of one or more of the above risks. Demand for the Company\u2019s loans in the secondary markets could also be affected by these risks, which could lead to a reduction in related business activities.\nThe Company may be required to reduce the value of any loans it marks as held for sale, which could adversely affect its results of operations. As a result of the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives in 2019, the Company sold certain loan pools which were previously held for investment and conducted sales with buyers who it had not previously transacted with.\nThe Company is Exposed to Risk of Environmental Liability When It Takes Title to Property.\nIn the course of its business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, the Company could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. The Company may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.\nOperating\nThe Company\u2019s Initiatives Resulting From Its Strategic Review May Not Be Successful.\nIn 2019, the Company initiated actions as a result of is strategic review of lines of business, balance sheet structure, efficiency, and stock repurchases. These actions are intended to produce more profitable and sustainable operations. These initiatives depend on conditions in the Company\u2019s operating environment and involve significant changes in resource allocation and staffing. If operating conditions change or unanticipated consequences are experienced, the Company\u2019s market position and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nDiscontinuing National Mortgage Banking Operations Exposes the Company to Additional Costs.\nThe FCLS national mortgage banking operations have been designated as discontinued and are held for sale. These operations involve a significant number of personnel and generate large volumes of loans and secondary market transactions and are the Company\u2019s largest source of fee income. Prospects for the sale of these operations depend on market conditions and expectations of potential buyers. The structuring of a sale or other arrangements to complete the discontinuation of these operations may require additional expenses or have the impact of impairing the operations or revenue generating potential of the business. The Company could incur losses from discontinuing the operations or based on pricing available from buyers in this market. Such impacts may not be fully recognized until a sale or other disposition is completed.\nExpansion, Growth, and Acquisitions Could Negatively Impact Earnings If Not Successful.\nSuccessful expansion depends on the maintenance and development of an adequate infrastructure. Success also depends on customer acceptance and the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. Profitability depends on whether the income generated will offset the increased operating expenses. The Company implemented certain expense restructuring activities, related in part to the rationalization of acquired operations. Changes in operations may result in inefficiencies or control deficiencies.\nMerger and acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks, including lending, operating, and integration risks. Such growth requires careful due diligence, evaluation of risks, and projections of future operations and financial conditions. Adverse developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions often involve extensive merger agreements, which may lead to litigation risks or operating constraints.\nThe Company has recruited executive and business line management to support its growth and expansion, and it has absorbed management of acquired operations. This involves retention risks, operating risks, and financial risks. Such recruitment can affect the retention of new and old business, and can also be affected by competitive reactions and other relationship risks in retaining accounts.\nRegulatory examinations may identify matters requiring attention. Deficiencies related to regulatory compliance may result in changes that affect operating revenues and costs, including the scope or scale of business activities and/or potential future expansion initiatives. The Company may also face additional acquisition approval requirements, and growth plans could be slowed if expected approvals are not obtained.\nCompetition From Financial Institutions and Other Financial Service Providers May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Growth and Profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. Larger banking institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer certain services not offered by the Company. Local competitors with excess capital may accept lower returns on new business. There is increased competition by out-of-market competitors through the internet and mobile technology. Federal regulations and financial support programs may in some cases favor competitors. Competition includes competition for banking teams and talent. Competition creates risk that revenues, earnings, or market share could be adversely affected by the loss of talent.\nMarket Changes May Adversely Affect Demand For The Company\u2019s Services and Impact Revenue, Costs, and Earnings.\nChannels for servicing the Company\u2019s customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. The Company has an ongoing process for evaluating the profitability of its branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships. The Company competes with larger providers who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process.\nThe Company anticipates accelerating changes in market behaviors such that there is increased preference for providers with social purpose missions and community service initiatives, particularly to the underbanked. The Company\u2019s strategic vision of building a 21st century community bank with a goal of purpose driven performance for all stakeholders is intended to future-proof the Company accelerated changes in market behaviors. The Company faces risk that these behaviors may change in a manner different from its expectations, which could affect future revenue, earnings, and recovery of investments in its strategic model.\nThe Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to the Use of Technology that Could Damage the Company's Reputation and Business.\nSecurity breaches of confidential information in our technology platforms could expose the Company to possible liability and damage its reputation. Any compromise of data security could also deter customers from using the Company's services. The Company relies on industry standard internet security and authentication systems to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect the Company's security systems from compromises or breaches and could result in damage to its reputation and business. The Company utilizes third party core banking software, in addition to other outsourced data processing. If third party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating and/or transmitting with such third parties, it could significantly affect its ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect its business operations. The Company interfaces with electronic payments systems which are subject to security and operational risks. The Company utilizes file encryption in designated internal systems and networks and is subject to certain state and federal regulations regarding how the Company manages data security. The Company's enterprise governance risk and compliance function includes a framework of controls, policies and technologies to monitor and protect information from cyberattacks, mishandling, and loss, together with safeguards related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Natural disasters and disaster recovery risks could affect its operating systems, which could affect its reputation. The Company's business continuity program addresses crisis management, business impact, and data and systems recovery. Potential problems with the management of technology security and operational risks may affect regulatory compliance, which could affect operating costs and expansion plans.\nThe Company Faces Cybersecurity Risks, Including Denial of Service Attacks, Hacking and Identity Theft that Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential Information or the Creation of Unauthorized Transactions, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business or Reputation and Create Significant Legal and Financial Exposure.\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, steal financial assets, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. As a growing regional bank, the Company may be subject to similar attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm and possible financial loss to the Company. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.\nThe Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients or to conduct unauthorized financial transactions.\nThese risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to the Company, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is Subject to Regulatory Environment Changes Regarding Privacy and Data Protection and Could have a Material Impact on our Results of Operations.\nThe growth and expansion of the company into a variety of new fields may potentially involve new regulatory issues/requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The potential costs of compliance with or imposed by new/existing regulations and policies that are applicable to us may affect the use of our products and services and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFinancial and Operating Counterparties Expose the Company to Risks.\nThe Company's use of derivative financial instruments exposes us to financial and contractual risks with counterparties. The Company maintains correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan participations, engage in securities and funding transactions, and undergo other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to its industry. The Company also utilizes services from major vendors of technology, telecommunications, and other essential operating services. There is financial and operating risk in these relationships, which the Company seeks to manage through internal controls and procedures, but there are no assurances that the Company will not experience loss or interruption of its business as a result of unforeseen events with these providers. The Company's mortgage banking operations have also exposed us to more counterparty transactions including the use of third parties to participate in the management of interest rate risk and mortgage sales and hedging. Financial and operational risks are inherent in these counterparty relationships. The Company could experience losses if there are failures in the controls or accounting, including those related to derivatives activities or if there are performance failures by any counterparties. The risk of loss is increased when interest rates\nchange suddenly and if the intended hedging objectives are not achieved as a result of market or counterparty behaviors.\nChanges in Executive Management Could Affect Operations.\nChanges in executive and senior management could introduce control risks in the oversight of operating activities and in the planning and execution of strategic objectives, which could adversely affect the operations of the Bank.\nThe Company May Not Be Able to Attract and Retain Skilled People.\nThe Company's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate its existing employees, and continue to compensate employees competitively. Competition for the best people can be intense and the Company may not be able to hire or retain appropriately qualified individuals. As a result of restructuring activities, the Company could experience challenges in the retention of existing employees.\nControls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure requirements and practices, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Business is Reliant on Outside Vendors.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the use of certain outside vendors for its day-to-day operations. The Company\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that a vendor may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in its agreements for any number of reasons including a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While the Company has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of vendor management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a vendor to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopment of New Products and Services May Impose Additional Costs on the Company and May Expose It to Increased Operational Risk.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate its products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. This dependency is exacerbated in the current \u201cFinTech\u201d environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as \u201cBlockchain,\u201d and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. The introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, the Company\u2019s ability to access technical and other information from its clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices and the preparation of marketing, sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks. The Company\u2019s failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes it to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to the Company\u2019s clients. Products and services relying on internet and mobile technologies may expose the Company to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation, as well as on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe forecasted discontinuation of LIBOR and the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the Company\u2019s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent panel banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR, such that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether and for how long LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what new or existing benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in industry views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nRegulators and various financial industry groups have sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish consultations on recommended practices for transitioning away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based repurchase transactions. At this time, it is still not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in the market, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to the Company\u2019s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company\u2019s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2021) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.\nThe Company established a LIBOR transition task force committee in 2018, which reports to the Enterprise Risk Management and Asset/Liability Committee. The task force has assessed the on- and off-balance sheet products that will be impacted with the LIBOR transition. The areas with the most impact are LIBOR based interest rate swaps and commercial loans that utilize LIBOR as the indexed rate. During 2019, revised LIBOR fallback language was added to all new Commercial loan contracts that contemplated the transition of LIBOR as an index rate. An impact assessment is underway to identify further exposures, such as systems, processes, and models affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products associated with LIBOR to alternative reference rates.\nActs of terrorism, severe weather, natural disasters, pandemics, public health issues and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nOur business is subject to risk from external events that could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. For example, financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems. The metropolitan Boston area remains a central target for potential acts of terrorism, including cyber terrorism, which could affect not only our operations but those of our customers. Additionally, there\ncould be sudden increases in electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber attacks. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, such as disrupt power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Operations and Future Growth.\nThe Company must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of its liquidity management, the Company uses a number of funding sources in addition to deposit growth and cash flows from loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. The Company uses brokered deposits both to support ongoing growth and to provide enhanced deposit insurance to support large dollar commercial relationships. The Company's financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the Company is unable to maintain access to wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with the Company.\nThe Company's Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends, and Otherwise Pay Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions. The Company\u2019s Stock Repurchase Program is also Dependent on These Distributions.\nA substantial source of holding company income is the receipt of dividends from the Bank, from which the Company services debt, pay obligations, and pay shareholder dividends. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other types of payments are an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay debt obligations, or pay dividends on its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s strategic initiative to liquidate less strategic assets and to use proceeds to repurchase excess capital also depend on dividend distributions from the Bank which are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions. The Company\u2019s ability to achieve targeted strategic benefits from this initiative may be compromised if Capital Distributions from the Bank are restricted or prohibited.\nSecondary Mortgage Market Conditions Could Have a Material Impact on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce the Company\u2019s loan production volumes and operating results.\nSecondary markets are significantly affected by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) for loan purchases that meet their conforming loan requirements. These agencies could limit purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other factors. Proposals to reform mortgage finance could affect the role of the Agencies and the market for conforming loans which comprise the majority of the Company\u2019s mortgage lending and related originations income.\nInterest Rates\nMarket Interest Rate Conditions Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNet interest income is the Company's largest source of income. Changes in interest rates can affect the level of net interest income and other elements of net income. The Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity is discussed in more detail in Item 7A of this report and is the primary market risk to its condition and operations. Changes in interest rates can also affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and the supply conditions in the U.S. financial and capital markets. Changes in the level of interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate real estate loans, the value of its assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings.\nSecurities Market Values\nDeclines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Earnings.\nDeclines in the value of investment securities due to market conditions and/or issuer impairment could result in losses that can reduce capital and earnings. The Company\u2019s investment in equity securities and non-investment grade debt securities present heightened credit and price risks. Under new accounting standards, equity gains and losses are recorded to current period operating results. The Company has an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\"FHLBB\") which could result in write-down in the event of impairment.\nTaxation\nChanges in Tax Preference Items May Affect Results of Operations.\nHigher tax expense due to planned or unplanned changes in tax preference items may result in lower profitability. Quarterly results may vary significantly from annual results.\nRegulatory\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\nNew federal or state laws and regulations could affect lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase compliance costs and affect business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect profitability.\nRegulatory capital requirements and their impact on the Company may change. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to support operations and continued growth. The Company's ability to raise capital, if needed, will depend on its condition and performance, and on market conditions.\nNew laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the markets for and value of its loans and investments, and ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nIn 2017, the Company crossed the $10 billion asset threshold established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company and the Bank are now subject to closer supervision by their primary regulators and, as to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Company and the Bank are subject to capital stress testing expectations which require significant resources and infrastructure. If the Company\u2019s compliance with the enhanced supervision and requirements is insufficient, there can be significant negative consequences for its operations, profitability, and ability to further pursue its strategic growth plan.\nProvisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\nProvisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware, and state and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of its common stock. These provisions include: limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of common stock; supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to terms of one year; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company's Board of Directors and for proposing matters that\nstockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, the Company is subject to Delaware laws, including one that prohibits engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for the Company's common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, its common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates May Not Be Realized in Accordance with Recorded Estimates.\nUnexpected Changes May Adversely Affect Condition or Performance.\nThe Company\u2019s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The SEC defines \u201ccritical accounting policies\u201d as those that require application of management\u2019s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. The Company\u2019s critical accounting policies are further discussed in Item 7 of this report. If actual events and results do not conform to critical estimates, there could be a material impact on financial condition, operating performance, and execution of the strategic plan.\nIf the Company Determines Goodwill or Other Intangible Assets to be Impaired, the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results Would Be Negatively Affected.\nWhen the Company completes a business combination, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. At least annually (or more frequently if indicators arise), the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of its reporting entities against the carrying value. If the Company determines goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, the Company will be required to write down these assets. Any write-down would have a negative effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA New Accounting Standard Will Require the Company to Increase Its Allowance For Loan Losses and May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Its Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company for its 2020 fiscal year. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This standard is also applicable to other financial assets carried at amortized cost. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data it would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nAcquisitions May Disrupt the Company\u2019s Business and Dilute Stockholder Value.\nFuture mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt, or equity securities may occur from time to time. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and may involve various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the target company\n\u2022\npayment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company\u2019s tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown or contingent liabilities, or asset quality problems, of the target company;\n\u2022\nunexpected regulatory responses to merger related applications\n\u2022\nlarger than anticipated merger-related expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, and retaining key employees and customers;\n\u2022\ninability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits; and\n\u2022\npotential diversion of Company management\u2019s time and attention.\n\u2022\npotential litigation could lead to additional expenses or prevent the completion of a merger agreement, which could result in the loss of the benefits which are targeted to offset merger costs.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. A significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may also prevent the attainment of targeted results. Additional discussion about the risk of acquisitions is included above in the discussion of Operating Risk.\nTrading of the Company's Common Stock\nThe Trading History of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Shareholder Investments May be Subject to Sudden Decreases Due to the Volatility of the Price of the Common Stock.\nThe level of interest and trading in the Company\u2019s stock depends on many factors beyond the Company's control. The market price of the Company's common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in interest rates; changes in the legal or regulatory environment; press releases, announcements or publicity relating to the Company or its competitors or relating to trends in its industry; changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors; future sales of its common stock; changes in economic conditions in the marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and other developments. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of the Company's common stock, regardless of actual operating performance, and could prevent stockholders from selling their common stock at a desirable price.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The Company could be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 88280, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BHLB"}
