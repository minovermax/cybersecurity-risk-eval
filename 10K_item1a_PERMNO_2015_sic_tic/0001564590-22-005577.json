We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIndustry and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to contain it have significantly adversely affected, and are likely to continue to significantly adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and result in stock price volatility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, a significant adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions. The actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, a curtailment of business activities (including changes in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), labor shortages, disruptions in supply, manufacturing and logistics, economic uncertainty and weakness, and volatility in the financial markets, both in the United States and abroad.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that Gentherm or its suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. At various times in the first half of 2020, substantially all of the Company\u2019s major OEM and Tier 1 customers temporarily ceased or significantly reduced production as a result of restrictions that were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. As a result, substantially all of our manufacturing facilities either temporarily suspended production or experienced significant reductions in volumes during this period. During 2021, the Company continued to see periodic, temporary mandates by governmental authorities that impacted our employees\u2019 ability to travel to and from our manufacturing facilities, following the resurgence of COVID-19 in certain geographic areas. Restrictions on the Company\u2019s access to its facilities and similar limitations for the Company\u2019s customers, OEMs, suppliers and distributors, have had a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations and could continue to have an impact in the future.\nGentherm has implemented numerous measures attempting to manage and mitigate the effects of the virus, however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful now or in the future. Gentherm has modified its business practices and it may take further actions as may be required by government authorities, for the continued health and safety of the employees, or that the Company otherwise determines are in the best interests of the employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. The Company's management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from its management and employees. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on the business may cause the Company to divert or delay the application of its resources toward other or new initiatives or investments, which may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in the markets in which the Company or its customers operate, or there is a continued resurgence in the virus in markets currently recovering from the spread of COVID-19, as we experienced with the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants during 2021 and continuing into 2022, then the Company's operations in areas impacted by such events could experience further materially adverse financial impacts. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Company's operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and its variants and the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy creating certain macroeconomic conditions that make this a particularly challenging business environment for us and the automotive industry, including global supply chain instability, inflationary cost increases and labor shortages, as described in other risk factors in this Annual Report. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price, including in ways that we cannot predict.\nThe inability of our supply chain, and the supply chain of the OEMs and Tier 1s that we supply, to deliver key components, such as semiconductors, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our business, profitability and results of operations.\nOur products contain a significant number of components that we source globally from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their global suppliers. If our supply chain fails to deliver products to us in sufficient quality and quantity on a timely basis, we will be challenged to meet our production schedules, fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation and customer relationships could be damaged. Similarly, OEMs and Tier 1s to whom we supply our products are dependent on an ever-greater number of global suppliers to manufacture and sell their products to consumers, which drives sales of our products. We and our customers are currently operating in a supply-constrained environment and are facing, and we expect to continue to face for at least the first half of 2022 and potentially longer, component shortages, manufacturing disruptions, logistics challenges and inflationary pressures, each of which is described below.\n\u2022\nComponent shortages. The automotive industry is highly reliant on semiconductors and is facing a significant shortage of semiconductors. The semiconductor supply chain is complex, with capacity constraints occurring throughout. We, the OEMs and Tier 1s must compete among the automotive supply chain and with other industries to satisfy current and near-term requirements for semiconductors, and such allocation is not within our control even though we have attempted and will continue to attempt various mitigating actions. Certain semiconductors we utilize are sourced from a very limited number of suppliers, which further exacerbates the risks to our operations. The shortage of semiconductors and other key components (historically, such as TEDs), has disrupted our production schedule and has caused us to procure components on the open market, from time to time, at prices significantly above the contractual pricing we have with our current long-term suppliers. OEM and Tier 1 production has also been impacted by the shortage, which has resulted in reduced sales of our products. Sudden changes in the production schedules of OEMs and Tier 1s also has resulted and may continue to result in operating inefficiencies which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. The component shortages have had and may continue to have materially adverse effect on our business, profitability and results of operations.\n\u2022\nRaw materials and component pricing. In addition to the component shortages we are currently experiencing, we have experienced and we may continue to experience risks associated with pricing of components and certain other raw materials. Some of our products contain certain components, such as semiconductor chips, tellurium, a raw material used in TEDs, and other key raw materials including copper, silver and petroleum-based engineered plastics and raw materials that generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these components and raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. If the market prices for these components and raw materials significantly increase, as they have in the past and during the COVID-19 pandemic, our gross profit has and may continue to be adversely impacted to the extent our suppliers pass those price increases on to us.\n\u2022\nLabor shortages and work stoppages. Labor shortages and work stoppages, including ours and those at our suppliers or customers, and similar events could significantly disrupt our business. Because the automotive industry relies heavily on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of components, labor shortages or work stoppages at one or more of Gentherm's production facilities or those of our suppliers could have adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of our direct customers or an OEM were to experience labor shortages or work stoppages, such as what occurred during the General Motors labor strike occurring in the Fall of 2019 or the prolonged work stoppages that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the temporary shutdown of the related Gentherm production facilities or other restructuring initiatives.\n\u2022\nInflationary pressures. The automotive industry has experienced a period of sustained price increases for various material components and shipping costs. These price increases are expected to continue into the foreseeable future as supply remains constrained and demand remains elevated. Although the Company has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher material component costs and shipping costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with Gentherm's customers and suppliers, have not historically and may not in the future fully offset our price increases which may result in adverse impacts to the Company\u2019s profitability and results of operations.\n\u2022\nLogistics challenges and excess supply. In order to secure components for our products, we have and may continue to strategically purchase components in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and\nresource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue business with us or limit the allocation of products to us, which could result in our inability to fill our supply needs, jeopardizing our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations, which could in turn, result in a decrease in revenues and profitability, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.\nOur supply chain has been and may in the future be adversely impacted by other events outside of our and their control, including other macroeconomic events, trade restrictions, economic recessions, political crises, labor relations issues, liquidity constraints, natural disasters and extreme weather events, which may become more frequent due to climate change.\nThe automotive industry, our primary market, is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we supply significant amounts of product, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Automotive segment represents 96%, 95% and 95% of our product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. Automotive sales and production are cyclical and have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially affected by general economic and industry conditions, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit for us, customers and consumers and other factors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe automotive component supply industry is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. Further, our competitors\u2019 efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and therefore may be more effective in adapting to customer requirements while being more profitable. In addition, our customers may increase levels of production insourcing for a variety of reasons, such as shifts in customers\u2019 business strategies or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in other countries, which may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products.\nIf we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry towards electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business.\nThe global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. Future automotive vehicle production may be affected by additional industry or consumer behaviors, including the development and use of autonomous and electric vehicles and increasing use of car and ridesharing and on-demand transportation as a service, as well as related regulations. The rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, including new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. Further, in comparison to us, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately, develop superior products, produce similar products at a lower cost, or adapt quicker to new technologies. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\nWe manage our business based on projected future sales volume, which is highly dependent on information received from customers and general market data, and any inaccuracies or changes in such information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe manage our business based upon projected future sales volumes, which are based upon many factors, including awarded business and assumptions of conversion rates thereof, customers\u2019 forecasts and general market data. Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated production schedules for volume adjustments, and our customers generally do not guarantee sales volumes. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty at any time. Further, our customers\u2019 forecasts are subject to numerous assumptions, and such forecasts often are/may be changed\nrapidly with limited notice. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not committed. We also must incur costs and make commitments well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with our projected future sales volumes, we could realize substantially less revenue and incur greater expenses over the life of vehicle programs.\nThe receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers is significantly affected by global automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes in demand for a broad variety of goods and services, labor shortages, inflationary pressures and a challenging and dynamic supply chain environment, has caused additional variability in customer purchase orders and caused customers to cancel their purchase orders, which has made it particularly challenging for us to project future sales volumes and manage our business in the current economic climate.\nThe loss or insolvency of any of our principal customers would adversely affect our future results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our top two customers were Adient and Lear which each comprised 15% of our product revenues. Combined, approximately 71% of product revenues to these customers was sourced directly by the Company\u2019s OEM customers. The continued growth, viability and financial stability of our principal customers, as well as the OEMS to which our products are supplied, are critical to our success. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to any of our customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We sometimes experience, and we expect to continue to experience, a delay in our collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers, which may be significant and would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy or other restructuring.\nOn October 28, 2021, Lear announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire the Interior Comfort Systems business unit of Kongsberg Automotive ASA, which is a key competitor of our climate comfort products, including CCS and seat heaters. The effects of this acquisition are not yet known; however, a decrease in product revenues to Lear could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the impact of any reduced relationship with Lear on the rest of our business is uncertain.\nOur inability to achieve product cost reductions which offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance.\nDownward pricing pressure is customarily applied by automotive manufacturers to the automotive supply chain. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products, as well as the costs incurred through our supply chain. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to effectively manage the development, timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nGentherm is developing and launching new products and related technologies for its battery performance solutions and electronics systems businesses and intends to launch other new products in the future. The launch of products employing new technologies is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the robustness of our product and manufacturing process development, success in sourcing new components and commodities with suitable suppliers, readiness of our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Given the complexity of new product launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs.\nIn addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs up to a few years prior to sales of such products. However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such operating failures could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and\ncould result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor. Any of the foregoing matters could result in a significant loss of revenue and market shares and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows.\nWe use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in many of the markets that we serve.\nWe cannot guarantee, however, that we will be able to secure all desired protection, nor that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate, to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate higher revenues and profitability than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations, and foreign governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies or provide reduced protection relative to other countries.\nOur ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers.\nWe have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar efforts will be required with existing and potential customers for additional products we develop using technologies we develop or license. Customers will only include our products if there appears to be consumer demand. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that temperature control seats or our other automotive products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable sales terms or better products, OEMs and other manufacturers may reduce availability or decline to include our products in their vehicles.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information or personal information.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, due to failure to timely upgrade systems or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, or resulting from failures of our third-party service providers, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs with most companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents, none of which were material in 2021. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; delay our ability to deliver products to customers; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders (including state-sponsored espionage or cyberwarfare) or insiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, \u201cransomware\u201d and other cyber-attacks, are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Many victims of ransomware are forced to pay significant ransoms to regain access to their critical business data, and we may not be permitted under various regulations and laws to make such payments. With some of our employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be increased opportunities for unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations, investigations and proceedings. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like those of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters (which may become more frequent due to climate change), unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. No IT system can be fully secure and impervious to all threats or failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, human resources information or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with its customers, lead to claims against us, fines and other penalties assessed upon us by governmental authorities, and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to remediate and protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes.\nIf certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products or production capacity is limited for any reason, such as terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances, natural disasters (which may be more frequent due to climate change), other catastrophic events, public health crises, labor shortages, work stoppages, or other events that cause facility closures or production disruptions, we may be unable to meet production requirements, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. For example, we experienced extended work stoppages in the first half of 2020 as the pandemic spread and governmental authorities initiated \u201clock-down\u201d orders for all non-essential activities. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply.\nWe maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales, harm to our business reputation or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Further, any such proceeds may be received and accounted for in a different reporting period, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow generally or for a specific reporting period.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliance into our business, our business could be materially adversely harmed.\nWe regularly consider opportunities to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances that could leverage our products and capabilities, as well as, enhance our customer base, geographic penetration and scale, to complement our current businesses, some of which could be material. Finding and assessing a potential growth opportunity and completing a transaction involves extensive due diligence, management time and expense; however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited. Further, we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions,\ninvestments and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned, including regarding anticipated synergies or other financial or operational benefits. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations, internal controls and general operating procedures. Further, for significant transactions, we would expect to incur additional debt, issue equity and/or increase capital expenditures, which may increase leverage risks, result in dilution or reduce capital available for other investments in ongoing operations. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and results of operations could be materially impacted. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Given our limited history in the patient temperature management business, the foregoing risks may be heightened due to our lack of experience in integrating similar businesses.\nOur global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results.\nIn 2021, 61% of our product revenue was generated from sales to customers outside the United States. We have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including China, Germany, Hungary, North Macedonia, Mexico, South Korea, Ukraine and Vietnam. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies.\nIn addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;\n\u2022\ndifferent and complex local laws and regulations and enforcement thereof, including those relating to governance, taxes, litigation, anti-corruption, employment, employee benefits, environmental, competition, permitting, investment, product regulations, repatriation, and export/import restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nincreases in duties, tariffs and taxation on our products related to U.S. trade disputes; trade restrictions and potential trade wars, including limitation on imports or exports of components or assembled products, unilaterally or bilaterally;\n\u2022\nexposure to infectious disease and epidemics, including the effects on our business operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nviolence and civil unrest (including acts of terrorism, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war);\n\u2022\nexpropriation, nationalization or other protectionist activities;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; in particular, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Vietnamese Dong, the Hungarian Forint, the North Macedonian Denar, the Ukrainian Hryvnia, the South Korean Won and the Mexican Peso;\n\u2022\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in due to anti-corruption laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries.\nAdditionally, our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, Vietnam, North Macedonia and Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. Political conflict and related demonstrations and violence in Ukraine in recent years, for example, highlights the risks to our foreign manufacturing facilities. Although our manufacturing facility in Ukraine is located approximately 700 miles by road from Kiev, and approximately the same distance from the activities along the border of Ukraine and Russia where fighting has occurred, we cannot be certain that similar demonstrations, unrest and international tensions will not affect our facility in the future, including due to electrical outages and periodic battles with separatists closer to our facility. In addition, certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict. Furthermore, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we would essentially experience a loss of the use of our Ukrainian facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our automotive and medical products could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOur design, manufacture and marketing of automotive products may subject us to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and, in the case of product liability, such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage. Any large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and we may incur significant costs to defend these claims. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we also may be required to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. Automotive manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims, as well as requiring their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. OEMs historically have recalled vehicles for perceived defects in seat heaters, and we have incurred liabilities in connection with the recalls and other field actions. In addition, governmental regulatory agencies throughout the world, such as NHTSA in the U.S., have safety standards that require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. A recall claim brought against us that is not insured, or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and reputation or market acceptance of our products. In certain instances, allegedly defective products may be the result of components supplied by our supply chain, and we may be limited in our ability to obtain recovery from our suppliers of materials or services included within our products that are associated with product liability and warranty claims, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to regulatory action, injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall, inadequate disclosure or defect could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements, such as further clinical testing. Such clinical testing is costly and time-consuming and could delay market approval or the meeting of additional post-market requirements.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nChanges to trade policy, including tariffs and customs regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nExisting free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For instance, beginning in 2018, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products. Most notably with respect to the automotive industry, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel,\naluminum and automotive components, and China imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. vehicles and certain automotive components. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales.\nTax matters, including changes in the corporate tax rates, disagreement with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and internationally. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position.\nWe also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of tax legislation and other initiatives, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $68 million in net deferred tax assets, inclusive of a $16 million valuation allowance. These deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryovers and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nOur patient temperature management business is subject to extensive industry regulation and failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulation may adversely impact us.\nOur patient temperature management products are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. In the United States, this is principally administered by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our medical products are sold also regulate that business. Under both United States and foreign country regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities (including third-party facilities that are performing services for us), procedures and operations and testing of our products. Following such FDA inspections, should any noncompliance with regulations or other quality issues be noted, we may receive observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could require us to get FDA approval of a corrective action plan and modify certain activities identified during the inspection, possibly at a significant cost. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our medical products to the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities where our products have been approved or received market clearance. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in liability claims, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses or, in rare circumstances, market withdrawal of the product.\nThe process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market new medical devices is time-consuming and costly. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping any new medical products. We cannot be certain that any new medical products we develop will receive FDA or other necessary approvals. Also receipt of approval in one country does not guarantee approval by the FDA or any other foreign regulatory agency.\nAny failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nOur operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair\nCompetition Law. Violations of these laws, which are complex and often difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant criminal penalties or sanctions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn the event that our products fail to perform as expected, whether allegedly due to our fault or that of one of our suppliers, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, and we have been in the past and may again be required or requested by our customers or regulators to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, and have utilized such insurance periodically. However, such coverage may be limited for future claims. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters and employment matters. Such legal and regulatory proceedings could result in an adverse outcome for the Company that would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments, workforce or production.\nWe have received, and may receive economic benefits from national, state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain or increase investment, workforce or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to fund new investments.\nWe are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. No assurance can be given that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner or operator of our properties or former properties has created an environmental condition not known to us. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by regulatory and customer-imposed requirements to address climate change and other sustainability issues.\nAs evidenced by shifting industry and consumer behaviors, including the development and use of electric vehicles, the automotive industry and consumers have a heightened focus on climate change and the environmental impact of product\nmanufacturing and end use. This increased focus on sustainability and the environmental impact of the automotive industry and manufacturing processes has caused our customers to impose additional requirements on us and our suppliers, which often exceed regulatory standards. These customer requirements include increased tracking and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental metrics, reduced waste and wastewater from operations, increased use of sustainable materials in our products, and the use of renewable energy sources in our factory operations. We expect to incur increased operating costs and capital expenditures to procure renewable energy and additional equipment or make operational and process changes to comply with customer requirements. To the extent we are unable to meet or exceed customer sustainability requirements, demand for our products and our revenues would be adversely impacted. We also expect that the increased focus on sustainability and climate change will result in new legislation or regulations at the federal, state or local level. Such legislative developments could adversely impact our business by increasing costs and could require us to make changes to our operations and result in substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs. These additional costs, changes in operations, or loss of revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks.\nLegislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the new California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts. Furthermore, in November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) was passed as a ballot measure. While many of the CPRA\u2019s substantive modifications will not go into effect until 2023, they will require businesses to dedicate time and resources on compliance efforts, in some cases requiring new or modified practices and operations.\nFinancial Risks\nOur existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total consolidated indebtedness was $38.8 million, with $440.0 million available for additional borrowings under the Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. If our outstanding borrowings increase, including under existing availability or if we incur additional indebtedness, the amount of our outstanding debt could have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nreducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and industries; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise;\nOur debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, make certain payments or distributions (including for the repurchase or redemption of our shares), engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and\nmay make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions.\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.\nIf an event of default would occur under our existing debt agreements or any additional indebtedness, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our existing credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities ceased immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. Our current outstanding variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $35 million of variable rate debt tied to USD LIBOR under our First Lien Credit Agreement with maximum maturities extending past June 30, 2023. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, the cessation of LIBOR or the announcement by the administrator of LIBOR or a governmental authority with jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent requires us to renegotiate or amend this agreement to select a replacement benchmark, which may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, the preferred alternative rate for LIBOR, or other alternative reference rates. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to or elimination of LIBOR, the use of SOFR or other alternative rates or benchmarks and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to or elimination of LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital, but it may result in interest rates and/or payments that result in higher borrowing costs over time as compared to our borrowing costs if the USD LIBOR continued to be available.\nWe are subject to significant foreign currency risk and foreign exchange exposure related to our global operations.\nA significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely affect our financial results and comparability of results from period to period.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which could adversely affect our profitability and operations.\nWe have undertaken significant restructuring activities in recent years that remain ongoing, and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure, lower our cost base, improve our financial performance and cash flow generation, and create a simplified organization best positioned to deliver on our key financial and operational priorities. Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned, on a timely basis or at all, will be on budget, or achieve the desired results.\nCommon Stock Investment Risks\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the automotive industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced significant stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these\ncompanies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nOn December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of common stock over a three-year period. Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any Company stock repurchases under the program may result in stock price and volume fluctuations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased approximately $20 million of shares under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program with an average price paid per share of $83.44. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program has $130 million of repurchase authorization remaining as of December 31, 2021.", "PERMNO": 79248, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "THRM"}
