{"cik": "896264", "company": "USANA HEALTH SCIENCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to and encounter various substantial risks and events that adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and the price of our common stock. You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly under the heading \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d on page 3, and the disclosures contained in Part I, \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d and Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this report, as well as in the other filings we make from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities. The fact that some of these risk factors may be the same or similar to those that we have included in other reports that we have filed with the SEC in past periods means only that the risks are present in multiple periods. We believe that many of the risks that are described here are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate and will likely be present in all periods. The fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance.\nThe risks discussed below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business.\nDirect selling is subject to intense government scrutiny, and regulation and changes in the law, or the interpretation and enforcement of the law, might adversely affect our business.\nVarious laws and regulations in the United States and other countries regulate the direct selling business model used by USANA. These laws and regulations exist at many levels of government in many different forms, including statutes, rules, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative orders. Direct selling regulations are inherently fact-based and often do not include \u201cbright line\u201d rules. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that the regulations, or a regulator\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of the regulations, could change. From time to time, we have received requests to supply information regarding our business to regulatory agencies. For example, we have been required to modify our Compensation Plan in the past in certain jurisdictions in order to comply with the interpretation of the regulations by local authorities. Where required by law, we obtain regulatory approval of our Compensation Plan or where approval is not required or available, we may seek the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance. Further, we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through direct selling in some countries, or we may be forced to alter our Compensation Plan.\nIn the United States, the FTC has entered into several highly publicized settlements with direct selling companies that required those companies to modify their compensation plans and business models. Those settlements resulted from actions brought by the FTC involving a variety of alleged violations of consumer protection laws, including misleading earnings representations by the involved\ncompanies\u2019 independent distributors, as well as the legal validity of those companies\u2019 business models and distributor compensation plans. For instance, in September 2019, the FTC entered into a consent order with a direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC alleged, among other things, that the company and its distributors were making misleading earnings claims, and that the company was utilizing an illegal business model. Pursuant to this consent order, the company was permanently prohibited from using a multilevel compensation plan in the U.S. Following this consent order, the FTC initiated litigation with another direct selling company, and that company has indicated that the FTC is seeking remedies similar to those in the 2019 consent order with the other direct selling company, including a prohibition of multilevel compensation in the U.S. In September 2016, the FTC entered into a consent order with another direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC alleged, among other things, that the company\u2019s distributors were making misleading earnings representations and that the company was utilizing an illegal business model. In July 2016, the FTC entered into a consent order with another direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC alleged that, among other things, that direct selling company\u2019s distributors had made misleading income representations and that the company was utilizing an unfair and deceptive compensation plan. The consent order in each of these cases required the respective direct selling company, among other things, to pay a significant fine, revise its U.S. business model and compensation plan to comply with various restrictions on how it can compensate independent distributors and change its marketing practices to avoid misleading income representations.\nFTC determinations such as these have created an ambiguity regarding the proper interpretation of the law and regulations applicable to direct selling companies in the U.S. Although a consent order between the FTC and a specific company does not represent judicial precedent, FTC officials have indicated that the direct selling industry should look to these consent orders, and the principles contained therein, for guidance. Additionally, while communications and guidance from the FTC to the direct selling industry in 2019 and 2018 reinforce the principles contained in these consent orders, these communications have also created ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the proper interpretation of the laws, regulations and judicial precedent applicable to direct selling in the U.S. We continue to analyze the consent orders, guidance and other communications issued by the FTC and we are in the process of both (i) refining aspects of our U.S. business model based on the principles contained in the FTC materials, and (ii) conducting additional analysis to determine if further changes to our model may be necessary. Although we strive to ensure that our overall business model and compensation plans are regulatory compliant in each of our markets, we cannot assure you that a regulator, if it were to review our business, would agree with our assessment and would not require us to change one or more aspects of our operations. Any action against us in the future by the FTC or another regulator could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future law, regulation, or guidance, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations, judicial decisions, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. Failure by us, or our Associates, to comply with these laws, regulations, or guidance, could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general. Finally, the continuation of regulatory challenges, investigations and litigation against other direct selling companies could harm our business and industry if the laws and regulations are interpreted in a way that results in additional restrictions on direct selling companies in general.\nThe violation of marketing or advertising laws by Associates in connection with the sale of our products or the improper promotion of our Compensation Plan could adversely affect our business.\nAll Associates contractually agree to adhere to our policies and procedures. Although these policies and procedures prohibit Associates from making false, misleading and other improper claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products, Associates may, without our knowledge and in violation of our policies, create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe USANA, our products or the Associate Compensation Plan. They also may make statements regarding potential earnings, product claims, or other matters in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters. These violations may result in legal action against us in our various markets, including in the U.S. by regulatory agencies, state attorneys general, or private parties - and in China by the Chinese government. Legal actions against us or our Associates or others who are associated with us could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business, including our business model. We take what we believe to be commercially reasonable steps to (i) regularly train our active Associate base, and (ii) monitor the activities of our Associates to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by Associates and to assure compliance with the terms of our policies and procedures and Compensation Plan. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective, particularly in times and regions where we may experience rapid growth. Adverse publicity resulting from such activities could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain Associates and Preferred Customers and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nWe may have or could incur obligations relating to the activities of our Associates.\nOur Associates are subject to taxation, and, in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies may impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as sales taxes or value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate records of such transactions. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our Associates. In particular, the laws in the United States regarding independent contractor status continue to evolve and, in some cases, have been applied unfavorably against gig economy and platform companies in certain states. It is possible that these laws could negatively impact the independent contractor status of distributors in direct selling companies like ours at either the state or federal government level. In the\nevent that federal, state or local laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations change to require us to treat our Associates as employees, or if our Associates are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors, under existing laws and interpretations, we may be deemed to be responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, wages, employee benefits, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur Greater China region accounts for a significant part of our business and expected growth. Any decline in sales or customers in this region would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Greater China region consists of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and has been our largest and most rapidly growing region over the last several years. Our international growth strategy has been centered on growing BabyCare\u2019s business in China for the last several years. As a result of this strategy, China has been our fastest growing market and is now our largest individual market representing approximately 44% of our sales and approximately 45% of our active Customers. In 2019, our sales and active Customer counts in both the Greater China region and our China market declined, largely as a result of a challenging operating environment in China. Additionally, as of the date of this Annual Report, health officials are responding to the outbreak of the coronavirus (see risk factor below captioned \u201cOur operating results for fiscal 2020, our China business and our worldwide business could be adversely affected by the outbreak of and response to the coronavirus or other health crises.\u201d)\nIf we are not successful in continuing to grow BabyCare\u2019s sales and customer base in China, our consolidated growth as a company will be negatively affected and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be harmed. BabyCare must comply with significant operational, financial, and other regulatory requirements to engage in direct selling in China. While we believe that we will be successful in growing BabyCare\u2019s business in China, it is difficult to assess the extent to which BabyCare\u2019s business model and compensation plan will be successful or deemed to be compliant with applicable Chinese laws and regulations. Although we are required to conduct our operations in China through BabyCare, we believe that our long-term success in China continues to depend on our ability to successfully integrate, to the extent possible, our operations with BabyCare\u2019s operations. In light of the factors listed above, and the other risks to our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in growing sales and customers in China through BabyCare.\nOur operations in China are subject to significant government regulation, as well as a variety of legal, political, and economic risks. If the government modifies its direct selling regulations, or interprets and enforces the regulations in a manner that is adverse to our business in China, our consolidated business and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nOur operations in China are conducted by BabyCare, a direct selling company that we indirectly acquired in 2010 to facilitate our expansion into China. BabyCare operates in China pursuant to direct selling laws and regulations that are uncertain and evolving. These regulations contain a number of financial and operational restrictions for direct selling companies, including prohibitions on pyramid selling and multi-level compensation. The laws and regulations are also subject to discretionary interpretation and enforcement by various state, provincial and municipal level officials in China. Regulators in China may modify current direct selling laws and regulations or change how they interpret and enforce them. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of existing and new regulations will not negatively impact our business in China, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties against us or our Associates.\nThe Chinese central government also exercises significant control over the Chinese economy, including through controlling capital, foreign currency exchange, foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, providing preferential treatment to certain industry segments or companies and issuing required licenses to conduct business. In addition, we could face additional risks resulting from changes in China\u2019s data privacy and security requirements. Accordingly, any adverse change in the Chinese governmental, economic or other policies could have a material adverse effect on BabyCare\u2019s business in China and our consolidated results of operations.\nTrade policies, tariffs, other trade actions which have been, or in the future may be, implemented by the United States against other countries, including China, relating to the import and export of certain products, and negotiations with respect thereto, may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations in China and other markets. In the past, China, and certain of our other markets, have imposed, or threatened to impose, tariffs on U.S. imports or to take other actions in retaliation to actions taken by the United States. Past or future developments in this regard may have a material adverse effect on the economy, financial markets, and currency exchange rates in China and the United States, which represent our two largest markets. Additionally, any actions taken by the Chinese government, or the government in our other markets, to implement further trade policy changes, financial restrictions, or increased regulatory scrutiny on U.S. companies could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough BabyCare utilizes a business model that has been developed specifically for China\u2019s laws and regulations, BabyCare\u2019s model, compensation plan, and operations have not been approved by the Chinese government.\nBabyCare\u2019s business model has been designed specifically for China\u2019s laws and regulations based on, among other things: (i) BabyCare\u2019s communications with the Chinese government, (ii) BabyCare\u2019s interpretation of the direct selling laws and regulations, as well as its understanding of how the government interprets and enforces the regulations, and (iii) BabyCare\u2019s understanding of how other multinational direct selling companies operate in China. Many of the components of BabyCare\u2019s business model are unique to China and are not part of our business model in our markets outside of China. For example, BabyCare sells products in China through a variety of methods, including: (a) online through its website; (b) at physical branch retail locations in China; (c) through direct sellers in provinces and municipalities where BabyCare has received a direct sales license; and (d) through independent distributors who are considered independent business owners under Chinese law. BabyCare has not received confirmation from the Chinese government that its business model and operations in China comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those pertaining to direct selling. We cannot be certain that BabyCare\u2019s business model, compensation plan or the activities of its employees, direct sellers or independent distributors will be deemed by Chinese regulatory authorities to be compliant with current or future laws and regulations. If BabyCare\u2019s model is deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations, as they are now or may in the future be interpreted or enforced, BabyCare could be subject to fines, penalties, suspension of its business in China or, ultimately, have its direct selling license revoked by the Chinese government, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in China.\nBabyCare\u2019s operations in China, and direct selling companies in general, are subject to significant government oversight, scrutiny and monitoring.\nChinese regulators regularly monitor and make inquiries about the business activities of direct sellers in China and have done so with BabyCare. These inquiries can arise in a variety of ways, including from complaints from customers, competitors or the media. For example, following media coverage of certain health product companies and direct selling companies in 2019, several departments of the Chinese government, including SAMR, MPS, and MOFCOM, initiated a review of health product and direct selling companies in China. The review required applicable companies such as BabyCare to conduct a self-assessment of the regulatory compliance of their business and to provide information to the government regarding the same. The review also entailed a review of a company\u2019s regulatory compliance by various departments of the Chinese government. During this review, the Chinese government, among other things, (i) instructed direct selling companies to not hold large distributor meetings, and (ii) suspended its application review process for direct sales licenses and authorizations. The Chinese government has yet to re-open the application review process for direct sales licenses and authorizations or indicate if or when it plans to do so. Additionally, following various media reports in 2017, certain departments of the Chinese government, including the former State Administration of Industry and Commerce (now SAMR) and MPS, carried out a review of the direct selling industry to investigate alleged violations of the direct selling regulations and anti-pyramiding regulations.\nThe Chinese government has investigated and imposed significant fines on companies and their distributors believed to have violated direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations. In some cases, it has even shut such companies down. There have been instances where inquiries or complaints about BabyCare\u2019s business have resulted in warnings from the Chinese government as well as the payment of fines by BabyCare. We expect that BabyCare will continue to face the risk of government inquiries, complaints or investigations, and any determination that BabyCare\u2019s business or the activities of its Associates are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in additional fines, disruption of business, or the suspension or termination of BabyCare\u2019s licenses, including its direct selling licenses, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. There can be no assurance that the Chinese government\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations will not negatively impact BabyCare\u2019s business, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties against BabyCare, USANA or our Associates in China.\nAdditionally, the direct selling regulations in China prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in China. Although we have implemented internal policies that are designed to promote our Associates\u2019 compliance with these regulations, we cannot guarantee that any of our Associates living outside of China or any of BabyCare\u2019s Associates in China have not engaged or will not engage in activities that violate our policies in this market or that violate Chinese law or other applicable laws and regulations and, therefore, might result in regulatory action and adverse publicity, which would harm our business in China.\nBabyCare must apply for and receive government approval to expand its business in China and its ability to expand could be negatively impacted if it is unable to obtain such required approvals.\nBabyCare has obtained direct selling licenses in certain provinces and municipalities and it must obtain various licenses and approvals from additional municipalities and provinces within China if it is to operate its direct selling business model in China. While direct selling licenses are centrally issued, the licenses are generally valid only in the jurisdictions within which related approvals have been obtained. Those approvals are generally awarded on local and provincial bases, and the approval process requires involvement with multiple ministries at each level. As of the date of this Annual Report, BabyCare has been granted licenses to engage in direct selling in the municipalities and provinces of Beijing, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Tianjin. In 2016, BabyCare received preliminary approval from the Chinese government to expand its direct selling business into the following eight additional provinces and municipalities: Liaoning Province, Shandong Province, Shanxi Province, Sichuan Province, Guangdong Province, Dalian City, Qingdao City, and Shenzhen City. Issuance of final direct selling approvals for these municipalities and provinces was contingent upon BabyCare satisfying certain conditions and\nreporting requirements. Although BabyCare has been working to satisfy these conditions and reporting requirements, we now believe that BabyCare will not receive the final direct selling approvals for any of these additional provinces and municipalities due predominantly to the Chinese government\u2019s suspension of the direct selling authorization review process in connection with the review of the direct sales industry, which occurred in 2019. Consequently, BabyCare will likely need to reapply for these approvals at some point, if and when the Chinese government again begins accepting direct selling authorization applications.\nGoing forward, BabyCare will be required to obtain licenses from municipalities and provinces within China where it does not hold a license. As noted above, as part of the Chinese government\u2019s review of the direct sales industry in 2019, the Chinese government suspended and has not yet reopened its application review process for direct sales licenses and approvals. If BabyCare is unable to obtain additional direct selling licenses as quickly as we would like, or at all, it would have a negative impact our ability to expand and grow our business in China. If and when the Chinese government again begins to accept direct selling applications and to issue direct sales licenses and authorizations, the process for obtaining the necessary government approvals will likely remain unpredictable, time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, the Chinese government may in the future continue to increase its investigation and scrutiny of the direct selling industry or modify the applicable regulations and licensing process. If the current processes for obtaining approvals are suspended or otherwise delayed for an extended period of time, or indefinitely, these events could have a negative impact on BabyCare\u2019s growth prospects in China. Ultimately, there can be no assurance that BabyCare will be successful in maintaining its current direct-selling licenses or obtaining additional direct-selling licenses or the required approvals to expand into additional locations in China that are important to its business.\nOur operating results for fiscal 2020, our China business and our worldwide business could be adversely affected by the outbreak of and response to the coronavirus or other health crises.\nIn December 2019 and early 2020, health officials in China began reporting on efforts related to an outbreak of and response to a novel strain of coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China. In late January 2020, in response to intensifying efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the Chinese government took a number of actions, which included extending the Chinese New Year holiday, quarantining and otherwise treating individuals in China who had the coronavirus, asking China residents to remain at home and to avoid gathering in public, and other actions. Following these actions in China, as well as confirmed cases of the coronavirus throughout the world, airlines and other service providers began suspending service in China. In connection with these actions, we extended the Chinese New Year holiday for our China employees by an additional two weeks to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. While the events related to the outbreak of and response to the coronavirus are expected to be temporary, they have disrupted our business in China during the first few months of 2020 and could continue to disrupt our business in China, and other markets, including by impacting consumer spending, gathering and other factors. Because of the uncertainty surrounding these events, the financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the coronavirus cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but could meaningfully affect our consolidated results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2020. As of the date of this Annual Report, the outbreak has been largely concentrated in China, although additional cases continue to be confirmed in many other countries. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. (See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for further discussion relating to the coronavirus.)\nOur results of operations could also be negatively impacted if the reality or fear of another communicable and rapidly spreading disease, health crisis, or natural disaster results in business interruption, travel restrictions or avoidance of public gatherings in one or more of our markets. It is difficult to predict the impact on our business, if any, of the emergence of new epidemics or other crises.\nAs a direct selling company, we sell our products to a network of active Customers. If we are unable to attract and retain active Customers, our business may be harmed.\nOur consumer base includes (i) non-employee, independent Associates who personally consume and sell our products, (ii) Preferred Customers who simply consume, but do not resell our products, and (iii) retail customers who typically purchase our products directly from Associates. We rely largely on our Associates to market and sell our products and to generate active Customer growth. Our ability to maintain and increase sales in the future will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of active Customers in each of our markets around the world. Our success will also depend on our ability to retain and motivate our existing Associates and attract new Associates. Associates typically market and sell our products on a part-time basis and often engage in other business activities, some of which may compete with us. We rely primarily upon our Associates to (i) attract, train and motivate new Associates, and (ii) attract and sell to Preferred Customers and retail customers. Our ability to continue to attract and retain active Customers can be affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\uf0b7General business and economic conditions;\n\uf0b7Adverse publicity or negative misinformation about our industry, us or our products;\n\uf0b7Negative public perceptions about direct selling in general;\n\uf0b7High-visibility investigations or legal proceedings against direct selling companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens;\n\uf0b7Public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional or dietary supplement, products generally;\n\uf0b7Other competing direct selling companies entering into the marketplace that may sell to our active Customers, or potential active Customers; and\n\uf0b7Changes to the Compensation Plan required by law or implemented for business reasons that make attracting and retaining Associates more difficult.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be successful in increasing or retaining the number of active Customers or that their productivity will increase.\nOur Associates may terminate their services at any time and, like most direct selling companies, we experience a high turnover among new Associates and Preferred Customers from year to year. Preferred Customers may stop buying from us at any time and it is challenging for organizations like ours to determine why a customer stops buying. In 2019, several of our markets, including China and the United States, experienced customer declines. If our strategies and initiatives, including our customer experience and social selling initiatives, do not drive growth in our active Customer base, particularly in China, the United States, and other markets, our operating results could be harmed. We cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of Associates because we primarily rely upon existing Associates to train new Associates and to motivate new and existing Associates. Our operating results in other markets could also be adversely affected if we do not generate sufficient interest in our business and our products to successfully retain existing Associates and Preferred Customers and attract new Associates and Preferred Customers.\nThe loss of a significant USANA Associate or Associate sales organization could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the successful efforts of our Associates that become leaders with our Company. Our Compensation Plan is designed to permit Associates to sponsor new Associates and Preferred Customers, thereby creating sales organizations. As a result, Associates develop business and personal relationships with other Associates and Preferred Customers. The loss of a key Associate or group of Associates, large turnover or decreases in the size of the key Associate force, seasonal or other decreases in product purchases, sales volume reduction, the costs associated with training new Associates, and other related expenses may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects, and we could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nOur international operations are presently conducted in various foreign countries, and we expect that the number of countries in which we operate could expand in the future. Economic conditions, including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets, may adversely affect our customers, their demand for our products and their ability to pay for our products. In addition, there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally, including, but not limited to, potential instability in international markets, changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations, currency fluctuations in foreign countries, political, economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including tax laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and the Bribery Act of 2010 (\u201cU.K. Anti-Bribery Act\u201d). In recent years there have been an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws, including a voluntary investigation we have been conducting into our China operations (see, \u201cAn internal investigation of our China operations is being conducted,\u201d under the caption below). The FCPA prohibits U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Anti-Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with these and other anti-bribery laws.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures and a compliance program designed to ensure that we, our employees, associates, distributors, agents and others who work with us in foreign countries comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for violations of these acts (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management (see, \u201cAn internal investigation of our China operations is being conducted,\u201d below).\nWe believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to grow in our existing international markets, enter new international markets on a timely basis, or that new markets will be profitable. We must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any international market. Also, before marketing commences in a new country or market, it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country. In addition to significant regulatory barriers, we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere. We may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country. Once we have entered a market, we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or to attract local customers. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals in new markets or that we will have sufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner.\nIn many market areas, other direct selling companies already have significant market penetration, the effect of which could be to desensitize the local Associate population to a new opportunity, such as USANA, or to make it more difficult for us to attract qualified Associates. Even if we are able to commence operations in new markets, there may not be a sufficient population of persons who are interested in our business. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our Compensation Plan across all markets where legally permissible. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to utilize our Compensation Plan seamlessly in all existing or future markets.\nAn internal investigation of our China operations is being conducted.\nWe are voluntarily conducting an internal investigation of our China operations, BabyCare. The investigation focuses on compliance with the FCPA and certain conduct and policies at BabyCare, including BabyCare\u2019s expense reimbursement policies. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has assumed direct responsibility for reviewing these matters and has hired experienced legal counsel to conduct the investigation. While we do not believe that the subject amounts are quantitatively material or will materially affect our financial statements, we cannot currently predict the outcome of the investigation on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our internal investigation is substantially complete; however, we continue to cooperate with the SEC and the United States Department of Justice. We cannot predict the duration, scope, or result of the investigation. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more governmental actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of the internal investigation, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, criminal penalties, or other relief. While one civil lawsuit was initiated as a result of these matters and dismissed by the court, there can be no assurance that other lawsuits will not be initiated against us as a result of these matters. We cannot predict whether potential future lawsuits will result in judgments against us and potentially any responsible current and former directors and officers. We expect to continue to incur costs in connection with our ongoing cooperation with the government and, potentially, in defending any potential civil or governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers or directors.\nOur products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets.\nThe manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries, including the FDA and the FTC. For example, failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal prosecutions. Any action of this type by the FDA could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We believe our manufacturing processes comply with these GMPs for dietary supplements. Nevertheless, any FDA action determining that our processes were non-compliant with dietary supplement GMPs, could materially adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products. In addition, the Dietary Supplement & Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over-the-counter products to notify the FDA when they receive reports of serious adverse events occurring within the United States. Potential FDA responses to any such report could include injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, or criminal prosecutions. We have an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years and believe that we are in compliance with this new law. Nevertheless, any action by the FDA in response to a serious adverse event report that may be filed by us could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.\nIn markets outside the United States, prior to commencing operations or marketing our products, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from a country\u2019s ministry of health or a comparable agency. For example, our manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah has been registered with the FDA and Health Canada and is certified by Australia\u2019s TGA. Approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients. China also extensively regulates the registration, labeling and marketing of our products. Consequently, the registration process for our products in China is complex and generally requires extensive analysis and approval by the CFDA. As a result, it may take several years to register a\nproduct in China. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. These activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies of the countries in which our products are sold.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. These potential effects could include, however, requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping and reporting requirements, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur in-house manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks.\nWe manufacture approximately 65% of the products sold to our customers. Additionally, our strategy over the past several years is to begin self-manufacturing our foods, personal care and skincare products, which will further increase the percentage of products we manufacture in-house. Because of our self-manufacturing practices, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA and CFDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals, solid and hazardous waste, and other toxic and hazardous materials. Our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances. Nevertheless, complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations, or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits, authorizations, and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes. Violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured. The combined costs of curing incidents of non-compliance, resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities, or of satisfying new legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur reliance on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products and the failure by these third parties to supply these products to us in accordance with our quality standards and specifications, as well as applicable laws and regulations, may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of some of our products, which account for approximately 35% of our product sales. These third-party suppliers and manufacturers produce and, in most cases, package these products according to formulations and specifications that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in-house product development team. These products include most of our gelatin-capsulated supplements, Rev3 Energy Drink, Probiotic, our powdered drink mixes, nutrition bars, and certain of our personal care products, including our Celavive products. Products manufactured by third-party suppliers at their locations must also pass through quality control and assurance procedures to ensure they are manufactured in conformance with our specifications. We cannot assure you that our outside contract manufacturers will continue to reliably supply products to us at the levels of quality, or the quantities, we require, and in compliance with our specifications or applicable laws, including under the FDA\u2019s GMP regulations. We have encountered situations in the past where we have had disagreements with contract manufacturers about the overall quality of products they have produced for us, and specifically whether such products conform to our specifications. We have also suspended and terminated relationships with contract manufacturers for quality issues and non-conforming products. While our business continuation plan contemplates events such as these, identifying and obtaining acceptable replacement manufacturing sources, on a timely basis or at all, is challenging. Additionally, transferring our third-party manufacturing business to another contract manufacturer can be expensive, time-consuming, result in delays in our production or shipping, reduce our net sales, damage our relationship with customers and damage our reputation in the marketplace. Any of these events, if they were to occur, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur liability with respect to our products.\nAs a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application, we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation. Additionally, the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. To date, we have not been a party to any product liability litigation, although, like any dietary supplement company, we have received reports from individuals who have asserted that they suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products. The number of reports we have received to date is nominal. These matters historically have been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments. We are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims. Although we maintain product liability insurance, which we believe to be adequate for our needs, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate.\nFluctuation in the value of currency exchange rates with the U.S. dollar affects our operations and our net sales and earnings.\nOver the past several years, a majority of our net sales have been generated outside the United States. Such sales for the year ended December 28, 2019, represented 90.1% of our total net sales. We will likely continue to expand our operations into new markets, exposing us to expanding risks of changes in social, political, and economic conditions, including changes in the laws and policies that govern investment or exchange in these markets. Because a significant portion of our sales are generated outside the United States, exchange rate fluctuations will have a significant effect on our sales and earnings. Further, if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically, it may become uneconomical for us to establish or to continue activities in certain countries. For instance, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our competitors sell similar products in the same market. As our business expands outside the United States, an increasing share of our net sales and operating costs is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accounting practices require that our non-U.S. financial results be converted to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Consequently, our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, with earnings generally increasing with a weaker U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar. With the exception of BabyCare\u2019s business in China, product purchases by our subsidiaries around the world are transacted in U.S. dollars. As our operations expand in countries where transactions may be made in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact that these changes might have on our future business, product pricing, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect our sales to customers outside the United States. Currently our strategy for reducing our exposure to currency fluctuation includes the timely and efficient repatriation of earnings from international markets where such earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and settlement of intercompany transactions. We also enter into currency exchange contracts to offset foreign currency exposure in various international markets. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. A foreign government may impose, and some have imposed, foreign currency remittance restrictions. For example, several markets in which we conduct business require that we file the necessary statutory financial statements for the relevant period as a prerequisite to repatriating cash in the form of a dividend. Any government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our operating results or cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations. Any such adverse effects could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nDifficult economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOver the past few years, economic conditions in many of the markets where we sell our products have resulted in challenges to our business. We cannot predict whether world or market-specific economies will improve or deteriorate in the future. If difficult economic conditions continue or worsen, we could experience declines in net sales, profitability and cash flow due to lower demand for our products or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers, potential customers or suppliers. Additionally, these conditions may result in a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources or otherwise negatively impact our operations or overall financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception.\nOur ability to attract and retain Associates and to sustain and enhance sales through our Associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry, our competition, or our business generally. Our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print, broadcast or social media, or other forms of Internet-based communications. This negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of direct selling, the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically, data privacy or security concerns, and regulatory investigations, regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our Associates or the business practices or products of our competitors or other direct selling companies.\nIn 2007, we were the victim of false statements made to the press and regulatory agencies, causing us to incur significant expense in defending and dispelling the allegations during 2007 and 2008. In 2012, we were again the target of false and misleading statements concerning our business practices, particularly in China and Hong Kong. This adverse publicity also had an adverse impact on the market price of our stock and caused insecurity among our Associates. Most recently, in April 2017, we were again the target of an anonymous short-seller blog that contained distortions of fact and misleading information about BabyCare\u2019s business in China.\nThere has been significant media and short-seller attention regarding the viability and legality of direct selling in the United States, China, and internationally recently and over the past few years. This attention has led to intense public scrutiny of the industry, as well as volatility in our stock price and the stock price of companies similar to ours. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur Associate Compensation Plan, or changes we make to it, may be viewed negatively by some Associates, could fail to achieve our desired objectives, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur line of business is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new competitors, new products and/or new distributor compensation plans. Direct selling companies commonly attempt to attract new distributors by offering generous distributor compensation plans. From time to time, we modify components of our Compensation Plan in an effort to (i) keep it competitive and attractive to existing and potential Associates, (ii) cause or address a change in Associate behavior, (iii) incent Associates to grow our business, (iv) conform to legal and regulatory requirements, and (v) address other business needs. In light of the size and diversity of our Associate force and the complexity of our Compensation Plan, it is difficult to predict how any changes to the plan will be viewed by Associates and whether such changes will achieve their desired results. There can be no assurance that changes to our Associate Compensation Plan will allow us to successfully attract new Associates or retain existing Associates, nor can we assure that any changes we make to our Compensation Plan will achieve our desired results.\nAdditionally, the payment of Associate incentives under our Compensation Plan is our most significant expense. These incentives include commissions, bonuses, and certain awards and prizes. Adjusting or enhancing our Compensation Plan directly affects the incentives we pay as a percentage of net sales. We may periodically adjust our Compensation Plan to prevent Associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on our earnings. There can be no assurance that changes to the Compensation Plan or product pricing will be successful in achieving target levels of Associate incentives as a percentage of net sales. Furthermore, such changes may make it difficult to attract and retain qualified and motivated Associates or cause us to lose some of our longer-standing Associates.\nLegal action by former Associates or third parties against us could harm our business.\nWe continually monitor and review our Associates\u2019 compliance with our policies and procedures as well the laws and regulations applicable to our business. In the ordinary course of our business, Associates occasionally fail to adhere to our policies and procedures. If this happens, we may take disciplinary action against the breaching Associate. This disciplinary action is based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and may include anything from warnings for minor violations to termination of the Associate\u2019s purchase and distribution rights for more serious violations. From time to time, we become involved in litigation with an Associate whose purchase and distribution rights have been terminated. We consider this type of litigation to be routine and incidental to our business. While neither the existence nor the outcome of this type of litigation is typically material to our business, in the past we have been involved in litigation of this nature that resulted in a large cash award against us. Our competitors have also been involved in this type of litigation, and more and more of these cases have resulted in class action litigation, where the result has been a large cash award against the competitor or a large cash settlement by the competitor. These types of challenges, awards or settlements could provide incentives for similar actions by other former Associates against us in the future, which could result in class action litigation against us. Any such challenge involving us or others in our industry could harm our business by resulting in fines or damages against us, creating adverse publicity about us or our industry, or hurting our ability to attract and retain customers. We believe that Associate compliance is critical to the integrity of our business, and, therefore, we will continue to be aggressive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures. As such, there can be no assurance that this type of litigation will not occur again in the future or result in an award or settlement that has a materially adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. We are aware of recent civil litigation against various direct selling companies in the United States, which have already resulted in settlements and may result in additional significant settlements in the future by these companies. There can be no assurance that we will not be challenged by private parties in litigation.\nThe inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe acquire all of our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third-party suppliers. Materials used in manufacturing our products are purchased through purchase order, often invoking pre-negotiated annual supply agreements. We have very few long-term agreements for the supply of these materials. There is a risk that any of our suppliers could discontinue selling raw materials to us. Although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products, any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages or back orders for products, with a resulting loss of net sales. In certain situations, we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source. There can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials that are needed by us in the quantities that we request or at the prices that we are willing to pay. Because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials, we are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials, based on conditions not within our control, including weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, strikes by supplier employees, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nIn the past, we have experienced temporary shortages of the raw materials used in certain of our nutritional products. Although we had identified multiple sources to supply such raw material ingredients, quantities of the materials we purchased during these shortages were at higher prices, which had a negative impact on our gross margins for those products. While we periodically experience price increases due to unexpected raw material shortages and other unanticipated events, we have been able to manage this by increasing the price at which we sell our products, therefore, this has historically not resulted in a material effect on our overall cost of goods sold.\nHowever, there is no assurance that our raw materials will not be significantly adversely affected in the future, causing our profitability to be reduced.\nDisruptions to shipping channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets.\nIn the past, we have felt the impact of disruptions to the shipping channels used to distribute our products. These disruptions have included increased port congestion, a lack of capacity on the railroads, and a shortage of manpower. For example, we experienced the impact of the West Coast port congestion that started late in 2014 due to worker strikes. In response to this congestion, we increased lead-times for shipments to our international markets, which caused an increase in our inventory levels. We also pursued alternative routes of transportation, which increased our shipping costs. Although the West Coast ports are now fully functioning, we cannot assure you that we will not experience port congestion in the future. Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our net sales.\nNutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies.\nOur products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption. Some of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. Although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form. We conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products, but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies. Furthermore, because we are highly dependent on consumers\u2019 perception of the efficacy, safety, and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, we could be adversely affected in the event that those products prove or are asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers\u2019 use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors.\nOur business is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger, wealthier, and more established competitors.\nWe face intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements, vitamins and minerals, personal care products, and other nutritional products, as described in greater detail in \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d Numerous manufacturers, distributors, and retailers compete actively for consumers and, in the case of other direct selling companies, for Associates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment. In addition, nutrition and personal care products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution, including retail stores. Also, entry is not particularly capital intensive or otherwise subject to high barriers to entry; as a result, new competitors can enter fairly easily and compete with us for customers and our Associates. Our product offerings in each product category are also relatively small, compared to the wide variety of products offered by many of our competitors.\nWe are also subject to significant competition from other direct selling organizations for the time, attention, and commitment of new and existing Associates. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part, on our success in recruiting and retaining Associates. There can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining Associates will be successful. The pool of individuals who may be interested in direct selling is limited in each market, and it is reduced to the extent other direct selling companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for Associates, there can be no assurance that other direct selling companies will not be able to recruit our existing Associates or deplete the pool of potential Associates in a given market. This risk is compounded by the relative ease with which our Associates can exit our business.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-U.S. jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), was enacted. The Tax Act contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a quasi-territorial system, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, increased deductions for capital spending, limitations on interest expense deductions, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. This tax legislation made other changes that could have an unfavorable impact on our overall U.S. federal tax liability in light of our current international operating structure. In particular, the tax legislation included a number of provisions that limit or eliminate various tax deductions, including those related to foreign tax credits and other deferred tax assets that we will not be able to realize under the new tax laws, each of which could affect our U.S. federal income tax position. As regulations are promulgated, we are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal income tax position. While we expect the Tax Act to be favorable to us over the long run, it may be unfavorable to our short-term financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the impact of the Tax Act on our federal taxes in the U.S., the Tax Act may impact our taxation in other jurisdictions, including with respect to state income taxes. Additionally, other foreign governing bodies may enact changes in their tax laws\nin reaction to the Tax Act that could result in changes in our global tax position and materially affect our financial position. There can be no assurance that additional changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to examination by other tax authorities, including state revenue agencies and other foreign governments. While we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from examinations by the IRS and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the actual outcome resulting from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, the IRS and several foreign tax authorities have increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing. Tax authorities could disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. If we do not prevail in any such disagreements, our profitability may be affected. Tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to particular intellectual property risks.\nMost of our products are not protected by patents. The labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers. Accordingly, patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common. Additionally, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products, as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and the interactions among various substances. In this respect, we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better, purer, and more effective formulations of our products. We protect our investment in research, as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products, by relying on trade secret laws. We have also entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees involved in research and development activities. Additionally, we endeavor to seek, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, trademark and trade dress protection for our products, which protection has been sought in the United States, Canada, and in many of the other countries in which we are either presently operating or plan to commence operations in the future. Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful. Nor can there be any assurance that third-parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of their intellectual proprietary rights. If an infringement claim is asserted, we may be required to obtain a license of such rights, pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis, or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our infringing products. Litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nA failure of our information technology systems would harm our business.\nThe global nature of our business and our seamless global compensation plan requires the development and implementation of robust and efficiently functioning information technology systems. Such systems are vulnerable to a variety of potential risks, including damage or interruption resulting from natural disasters and telecommunication failures and human error or intentional acts of sabotage, vandalism, break-ins and similar acts. Although we have adopted and implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, which includes routine back-up, off-site archiving and storage, and certain redundancies, the occurrence of any of these events could result in costly interruptions or failures adversely affecting our business and the results of our operations.\nWe rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A data security failure involving that technology or the data stored in it, could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation. Likewise, a data breach at USANA could lead to significant liability and reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of our global business, we collect and store significant amounts of data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information (some of which is sensitive) and payment card information of our Associates, customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, transmission and, when appropriate, deletion of this information is critical to our operations, regulatory compliance and business strategy. Although we strive to frequently analyze and improve our data security measures, our information technology and infrastructure are subject to persistent attacks of varying degrees and types and we may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to a cyber incident, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, telecommunications system failure, service provider or vendor error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions, employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. In some instances it could take us time to discover that we have fallen victim to such a breach. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information on our network could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered,\ndamaged, held ransom, lost or stolen. In any such event, we could suffer significant loss or incur significant liability, including: damage to our reputation; loss of customer confidence or goodwill; and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate the resulting damage (including notification and credit monitoring costs, as well as fines and penalties imposed by regulators) to affected individuals or business partners, or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings, by affected individuals, business partners or regulators. Furthermore, such data breach could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPersonal privacy, data protection and information security are significant issues in the United States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our products and services. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the FTC and various state, local and foreign bodies and agencies.\nThe United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, including end-customers and employees. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Additionally, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including in China, Australia, the European Union, Japan and numerous other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement new privacy and security policies, permit individuals to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals' consent to use personal information for certain purposes.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact of such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. We expect that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted differently in the future. For example, in January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) took effect, which provides new data privacy rights for consumers in California and new operational requirements for companies doing business in California. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties. Also, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the regulatory framework for the future of personal data transfers from the European Union to the United States with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which imposes more stringent EU data protection requirements, provides an enforcement authority, and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the GDPR depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the GDPR or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to 4% of our worldwide annual revenue. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, including the adoption of the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products, require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. In China, on June 1, 2017, a national Cybersecurity Law came into effect to address cybersecurity and data privacy protection. There remains considerable uncertainty as to how the Cybersecurity Law will be applied, and the regulatory environment continues to evolve rapidly with draft guidelines published frequently. In January 2019, a new e-Commerce Law went into effect in China that targets the protection of personal data in e-commerce transactions and environments. There are also numerous provincial and industry-specific regulations that may impact our business and use and protection of personal data in China.\nAlthough we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our products. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs in striving to comply with these various national and international data privacy laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also require us to restrict our ability to provide services to our customers that they may find valuable or otherwise require us to change our business practices in a manner that is ultimately adverse to our business objectives. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Any inability to\nadequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may incur liability under our \u201cAthlete Guarantee\u201d program, if and to the extent participating athletes make a successful claim against USANA for testing positive for certain banned substances while taking USANA nutritional supplements.\nWe believe that our nutritional supplement products are free from substances that have been banned by world-class training and competitive athletic programs. We retain independent testing agencies to conduct periodic checks for banned substances. We further believe that, while our products promote good health, they are not otherwise considered to be \u201cperformance enhancing\u201d as that term has been used in defining substances that are banned from use in international competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency (\u201cWADA\u201d). For many years, we have been a sponsor of Olympic athletes and professional competitors around the world. These athletes have been tested on many occasions and have never tested positive for banned substances as a result of taking USANA nutritional products. To back up our claim that athletes who use USANA products as part of their training regimen will not be consuming banned substances, we have offered to enter into agreements with select athletes, some of whom have high-profiles and are highly compensated, which state that, during the term of the agreement, should the athlete test positive for a banned substance included in the WADA, and should such positive result be the result of taking USANA nutritional products, we will compensate that athlete at an amount equal to two times their current annual earnings up to $1.0 million dollars, based on the athlete\u2019s personal level of competition, endorsement, and other income, as well as other factors. To mitigate potential exposure under these agreements, we:\n\uf0b7Designate lots identified as dedicated to the Athlete Guarantee program and retain additional samples\n\uf0b7Store designated lot samples externally with a third-party; and\n\uf0b7Establish a chain of custody that requires signatures on behalf of us and the third-party to transfer possession of the product lots and that restricts access by our employees after the transfer.\nAll applicants to this Athlete Guarantee program are subject to screening and acceptance by us in our sole discretion. Contracts are tailored to fit the athlete\u2019s individual circumstances and the amount of our exposure is limited based on the level of sponsorship of the participating athlete. Although we believe that the pool of current and potential participants in the program is small, there is no guarantee that an athlete who is accepted in the program will not successfully make a claim against us. We currently have no insurance to protect us from potential claims under this program.\nThe loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur executive officers are primarily responsible for our day-to-day operations, and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers, to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team. We depend upon the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Guest, our President, Jim Brown, and our Chief Financial Officer, Douglas Hekking, as well as other key members of our executive team. We cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, nor do we have an employment agreement with any of our executive officers. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact our business.\nWe are required by federal securities laws to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the companies\u2019 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Although we review internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we could be required to take costly and time-consuming corrective measures, to remedy any number of deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, be required to restate the affected historical financial statements, be subjected to investigations and/or sanctions by federal and state securities regulators, and be subjected to civil lawsuits by security holders. Any of the foregoing could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and in our company and would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock and in our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future.\nThe beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives our founder and parties related to or affiliated with him effective control, and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues.\nGull Global, Ltd., an entity that is solely owned and controlled by our founder and current Chairman of the Board of Directors, Dr. Myron Wentz, owned approximately 45.56% of our outstanding common stock at December 28, 2019. By virtue of this stock ownership, Dr. Wentz is able to exert significant influence and control over the election of the members of our Board of Directors and our business affairs. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to shareholders. There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to these relationships or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to other shareholders of the Company.\nSales by our shareholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA large number of outstanding shares of our common stock are held by several of our principal shareholders. If any of these principal shareholders were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained. We have a relatively small public float compared to the number of our shares outstanding. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which investors\u2019 interest in our common stock will provide an active and liquid trading market. Due to our limited public float, we are vulnerable to investors taking a \u201cshort position\u201d in our common stock, which is likely to have a depressing effect on the price of our common stock and add increased volatility to our trading market. The price of our common stock also may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, material announcements by us or our competitors, governmental regulatory action, conditions in the nutritional supplement industry, negative publicity, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have, in certain cases, not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies. Our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If that were to occur, the price of our common stock, and accordingly, the value of a shareholder\u2019s investment in our company, would likely decline, perhaps substantially.\nOur share repurchase plan has been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2000, with our Board of Directors periodically approving additional dollar amounts for share repurchases under the plan. We began the fourth quarter of 2019 with $30 million remaining under the plan.", "PERMNO": 84010, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "USNA"}
