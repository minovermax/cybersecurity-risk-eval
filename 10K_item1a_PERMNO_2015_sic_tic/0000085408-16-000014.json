RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our equity or debt securities.\nOur business depends solely on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry. Adverse developments affecting the industry, including declines in oil or gas prices and reduced demand for oil and gas products, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for drilling services depends heavily on a variety of economic and political factors and the level of oil and gas activity worldwide. Sustained declines in oil or natural gas prices such as we have been experiencing since mid-2014, combined with market expectations of a prolonged weakened global market, have caused oil and gas companies to significantly reduce their exploration, development and production activities, thereby decreasing demand for offshore drilling services and leading to lower rig utilization and day rates for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been very volatile, and our drilling operations have in the past suffered through long periods of weak market conditions.\nDemand for our drilling services depends on many factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide demand for and prices of oil and natural gas, and expectations regarding future energy prices;\n\u2022\nthe supply of drilling units in the worldwide fleet versus demand;\n\u2022\nthe level of exploration and development expenditures by energy companies and the ability to raise capital;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to limit production levels and influence prices;\n\u2022\nthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nthe effect of economic sanctions that affect the energy industry;\n\u2022\nthe general economy, including inflation and changes in the rate of economic growth;\n\u2022\nthe condition of global capital markets;\n\u2022\nadverse sea, weather and climate conditions in our principal operating areas, including possible disruption of exploration and development activities due to loop currents, hurricanes and other severe sea and weather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nenvironmental and other laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolicies of various governments regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nnationalization and/or confiscation;\n\u2022\nworldwide tax policies;\n\u2022\npolitical and military conflicts in oil-producing areas and the effects of terrorism;\n\u2022\nincreased supply of oil and gas from onshore hydraulic fracturing and shale development and relative cost of offshore drilling versus onshore oil and gas production;\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels and energy sources, and\n\u2022\nmerger, divestiture, restructuring and consolidation of our customers and competitors and their assets.\nAdverse developments affecting the industry as a result of one or more of these factors, including a decline in oil or gas prices (such as the decline since mid-2014, any further decline, or the failure of oil or gas prices to recover from their current levels),\na global recession, continued declines in demand for oil and gas products, increased oversupply of drilling units, and increased regulation of drilling and production, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to secure contracts for our drilling units at sufficient day rates. Depressed oil and gas prices and an oversupply of drilling units have led to further reductions in rig utilization and day rates, which may materially impact our profitability.\nOur ability to meet our cash flow obligations depends on our ability to secure ongoing work for our drilling units at sufficient day rates. As of January 20, 2016, we had nine jack-up drilling units without contracts (including three cold-stacked); six with contract terms ending in 2016; four with contract terms ending in 2017; seven with contract terms ending in 2018; and one with a contract term ending in 2024. Three of our drillships have contracts ending in 2017 and one ends in early 2018. Given current market conditions, it is likely that future demand for offshore drilling units and day rates will continue to decline for an extended period of time. Failure to secure profitable contracts for our drilling units could negatively impact our operating results and financial position, impair our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and/or meet our other obligations.\nPrior to the recent downturn in the drilling sector, the industry experienced a significant increase in construction activity. This increase in supply of newbuild drilling units, combined with the decrease in demand for offshore drilling services, has resulted in an oversupply of drilling units and a resulting decline in utilization and day rates that is expected to continue for an extended period of time. According to industry sources, there were 596 marketed jack-up rigs worldwide as of February 2, 2016, inclusive of 125 units that are under construction or on order and 340 marketed floaters (drillships and semi-submersible) worldwide, inclusive of 70 units that are under construction or on order. (We define marketed rigs as all rigs that are not cold-stacked.) A continued decline in utilization and day rates would further impact our revenues and profitability.\nA further decline in the market for contract drilling services could result in additional asset impairment charges.\nWe recognized asset impairment charges on our jack-up drilling units aggregating approximately $566 million in 2014 and $330 million in 2015, or approximately 7% and 4%, respectively, of our fixed asset carrying values. Prolonged periods of low utilization and day rates, the cold-stacking of idle assets, or the sale of assets below their then carrying value could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges on our drilling units if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. See \u201cImpairment of Long-lived Assets\u201d in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe are subject to operating risks that could result in environmental damage, property loss, personal injury, death, business interruptions and other losses.\nOur drilling operations are subject to many operational hazards such as blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, punch-throughs (i.e., when one leg of a jack-up rig breaks through the hard crust of the ocean floor, placing stress on the other legs), mechanical or technological failures, navigation errors, or equipment defects that could increase the likelihood of accidents. Accidents can result in:\n\u2022\nserious damage to or destruction of property and equipment;\n\u2022\npersonal injury or death;\n\u2022\ncostly delays or cancellations of drilling operations;\n\u2022\ninterruption or cessation of day rate revenue;\n\u2022\nuncompensated downtime;\n\u2022\nreduced day rates;\n\u2022\nsignificant impairment of producing wells, leased properties, pipelines or underground geological formations;\n\u2022\ndamage to fisheries and pollution of the marine and coastal environment; and\n\u2022\nfines and penalties.\nOur drilling operations are also subject to marine hazards, whether at drilling sites or while equipment is under tow, such as a vessel capsizing, sinking, colliding or grounding. In addition, raising and lowering jack-up rigs and drilling into high-pressure formations are complex, hazardous activities, and we periodically encounter problems. Any ongoing change in weather or sea patterns or climate conditions could increase the adverse impact of marine hazards.\nIn past years, we have experienced some of the types of incidents described above, including punch-throughs and towing accidents resulting in lost or damaged equipment and high-pressure drilling accidents resulting in lost or damaged formations. Any future such events could result in operating losses and have a significant impact on our business.\nThe global nature of our operations involves additional risks, particularly in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nOur operations are significantly diversified internationally. Foreign operations are often subject to additional political, economic and other uncertainties, such as with respect to taxation policies, customs restrictions, local content requirements, regulatory requirements, currency convertibility and repatriation, security threats including terrorism, piracy, and the risk of asset expropriation. Political unrest and regulatory restrictions could halt operations or impact us in other unforeseen ways. There have been recent political discussions regarding the possibility of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union. Should that occur, our business and operations in the UK and elsewhere could be impacted.\nMany countries have regulations or policies requiring or rewarding the participation of local companies and individuals in the petroleum-related activities. Such participation requirements can include, without limitation, the ownership of oil and gas concessions, the hiring of local agents and partners, the procurement of goods and services from local sources, and the employment of local workers. The requirements can also include ownership of our drilling units, in whole or in part, by home country companies or citizens and /or require reflagging of our drilling units under the flag of the home country. The governments of many of these foreign countries have become increasingly active in requiring higher levels of local participation which may increase our costs and risks of operating in these regions, thereby limiting our ability to enter into, relocate from, or compete in these regions.\nIn addition, our inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis could delay or interrupt our operations resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Further, governmental restrictions in some jurisdictions may make it difficult for us to move our personnel, assets and operations in and out of these regions without delays or downtime.\nIn foreign areas where legal protections may be less available to us, we assume greater risk that our customer may terminate contracts without cause on short notice, contractually or by governmental action. Additionally, operations in certain areas, such as the North Sea and US GOM, are highly regulated and have higher compliance and operating costs in general.\nAlthough we are a U.K. company, a significant majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars, which is our functional currency. However, in certain countries in which we operate, local laws or contracts may require us to receive some portion of payment in the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk to the extent the amount of our monetary assets denominated in the foreign currency differs from our obligations in that foreign currency. In order to mitigate the effect of exchange rate risk, we attempt to limit foreign currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities denominated in the foreign currency. At December 31, 2015, we held Egyptian pounds in the amount of $13.5 million. We ceased drilling operations in Egypt in 2014, and are currently working to obtain access to the funds for use outside Egypt to the extent they are not utilized; however, we can provide no assurance we will be able to convert or utilize such funds in the future.\nThe offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry is a highly competitive and cyclical business characterized by numerous competitors, high capital and operating costs and evolving capability of newer rigs. Drilling contracts are often awarded on a competitive-bid basis, and intense price competition, rig availability, location and suitability, experience of the workforce, efficiency, safety performance record, technical capability and condition of equipment, operating integrity, reputation, industry standing and client relations are all factors in determining which contractor is awarded a contract. Our future success and profitability will partly depend upon our ability to keep pace with our customers\u2019 demands with respect to these factors.\nIn addition to intense competition, our industry has historically been cyclical. The contract drilling industry is currently in a period of low demand for drilling services, excess rig supply, a prolonged period of declining oil and gas prices and reduced worldwide drilling activity. These conditions have intensified the competition in the industry and put downward pressure on day rates. As a result, we may be unable to secure profitable contracts for our drilling units, we may have to contract our rigs at substantially lower rates for long periods of time, enter into nontraditional fee arrangements, or idle or cold-stack some of our drilling units, all of which would adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and financial position.\nWe will experience reduced profitability if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our drilling contracts, and our backlog of contracts may not be ultimately realized.\nWe may be subject to the increased risk of our customers seeking to terminate or renegotiate their contracts. Our customers\u2019 ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts with us may also be adversely affected by their own financial position, restricted credit markets and the current industry downturn. If our customers cancel or are unable to renew some of their contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, if contracts are disputed or suspended for an extended period of time, or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, such events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our term drilling contracts are cancelable by the customer without penalty upon the occurrence of events beyond our control such as the loss or destruction of the drilling unit, or the suspension of drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment. While most of our contracts require the customer to pay a termination fee in the event of an early cancellation without cause, early termination payments will not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract, and could result in the drilling unit becoming idle or cold-stacked for an extended period of time. If we or our customers are unable to perform under existing contracts for any reason or replace terminated contracts with new contracts having less favorable terms, our backlog of estimated revenues would decline, adversely affecting our financial results.\nWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to build, maintain, and upgrade our drilling fleet.\nOur business is highly capital intensive and dependent on having sufficient cash flow and or available sources of financing in order to fund our capital expenditure requirements. We can provide no assurance that we will have access to adequate or economical sources of capital to fund our capital expenditures.\nWe have and will likely continue to have certain customer concentrations, and the loss of a significant customer would adversely impact our financial results.\nA concentration of customers increases the risks associated with any possible (i) termination or nonperformance of drilling contracts, (ii) failure to renew contracts or award new contracts, or (iii) reduction of our customers' drilling programs. In 2015, Saudi Aramco, ConocoPhillips, and Anadarko accounted for 19%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. The loss or material reduction of business from a significant customer would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, to the extent that we may be heavily dependent on any single customer, we could be subject to the risks faced by that customer to the extent that such risks impede the customer's ability to continue operating and make timely payments to us. In addition, due to the high day rate and longer-term nature of our drillship contracts, a loss of any of our drillship customers would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nConstruction upgrades, enhancements, conversions, mobilizations and repairs of rigs and drillships are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time as our drilling units age, we may be required to make significant upgrade, refurbishment or repair expenditures for our fleet or undertake new construction projects. Mobilization of existing units and initial operations of new drilling units often result in delays and other complications that could result in significant unexpected costs, uncompensated downtime, reduced day rates or the cancellation or termination of drilling contracts. Further, we may be required to pay up front for our own mobilization or upgrade costs in order to obtain a contract on a drilling unit. Some of the costs associated with upgrades, enhancements, conversions, mobilizations and repairs of drilling units could be unplanned and are subject to risks of cost overruns or delays as a result of numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nshipyard unavailability;\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor for completion of repairs or upgrades to our equipment;\n\u2022\nunscheduled delays in the delivery or cost increases of materials and equipment or in shipyard construction;\n\u2022\nfailure of equipment to meet, design, quality or performance standards;\n\u2022\nloss of or damage to essential equipment while in transit;\n\u2022\nfinancial or operating difficulties experienced by equipment vendors or the shipyard;\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n\u2022\nlocal customs strikes or related work slowdowns that could delay importation of equipment or materials;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment;\n\u2022\ndesign or engineering changes;\n\u2022\nlatent damages or deterioration to the hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nclient acceptance delays;\n\u2022\nweather interference, storm damage or other events of force majeure;\n\u2022\ndisputes with shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of shipyards and suppliers to honor warranty obligations;\n\u2022\nlong lead-times for replacement of equipment;\n\u2022\nshipyard failures and difficulties;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases, including relating to raw materials used in construction of our drilling units; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals or in meeting permit or approval conditions.\nThese factors may contribute to cost variations or delays. Such delays may, in some circumstances, result in a delay in contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue to us or payment for liquidated damages, and may also cause customers to renegotiate, terminate or shorten the term of a drilling contract pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses. In the event of termination of a contract, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms or at all. Additionally, unexpected capital expenditures for upgrades, refurbishment and construction projects could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures. Moreover, our drilling units that may undergo upgrade, refurbishment or repair may not earn a day rate during the periods they are out of service. Furthermore, the inability or unwillingness of shipyards and suppliers to honor warranty obligations may result in additional costs to us. The occurrence of any of these events would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIf we or our customers are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for drilling operations, we may be forced to suspend or cease our operations, and our profitability may be reduced.\nCrude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations require numerous permits and approvals for us and our customers from governmental agencies in the areas in which we operate. In addition, many governmental agencies have increased regulatory oversight and permitting requirements in recent years. If we or our customers are not able to obtain necessary permits and approvals in a timely manner, our operations will be adversely affected. Obtaining all necessary permits and approvals may necessitate substantial expenditures to comply with the requirements of these permits and approvals, future changes to these permits or approvals, or any adverse change in the interpretation of existing permits and approvals. In addition, such regulatory requirements and restrictions could also delay or curtail our operations, require us to make substantial expenditures to meet compliance requirements, and could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations and may create a risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to function as planned.\nFor example, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, have implemented significant environmental and safety regulations applicable to drilling operations in the US GOM. These regulations have at times adversely impacted the ability of our customers to obtain necessary permits and approval on a timely basis and/or to continue operations uninterrupted under existing permits.\nIncreases in regulatory requirements could significantly increase our costs or delay our operations.\nMany aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulation, including equipping and operating vessels, drilling practices and methods, and taxation. For example, operations in certain areas, such as the US GOM and the North Sea, are highly regulated\nand have higher compliance and operating costs in general. We may be required to make significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that such laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or result in a reduction of revenues associated with downtime required to implement regulatory requirements.\nOil and gas operations in the US GOM and in many of the international locations in which we operate are subject to regulation with respect to well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system, or SEMS. New regulations continue to be implemented, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well-control systems and lifesaving systems, as well as rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third-party audits of SEMS programs. Such new regulations may require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment, or require new equipment, and could increase our operating costs and cause downtime for our units if we are required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections, or if we are required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections to meet any such new requirements. Additional governmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of our operations and could reduce exploration activity in the areas in which we operate.\nGovernments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas, and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. These governmental regulations may limit or substantially increase the cost of drilling activity in an operating area generally. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities.\nGovernments around the world are beginning to adopt laws and regulations regarding climate change. Lawmakers and regulators in the U.S., the U.K. and other jurisdictions where we operate have focused increasingly on restricting and reporting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse\u201d gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers and our customers. We may be exposed to risks related to new laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements pertaining to climate change, greenhouse gases, carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and our drilling services. Governments may also pass laws or regulations incentivizing or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our drilling services. Such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business, and could adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities.\nIn addition, the offshore drilling industry is highly dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas industry and accordingly, regulations of the production and transportation of oil and gas generally could impact demand for our services.\nOur drilling units are subject to damage or destruction by severe weather, and our drilling operations may be affected by severe weather conditions.\nOur drilling rigs are located in areas that frequently experience hurricanes and other forms of severe weather conditions. These conditions can cause damage or destruction to our drilling units. Further, high winds and turbulent seas can cause us to suspend operations on drilling units for significant periods of time. Even if our drilling units are not damaged or lost due to severe weather, we may experience disruptions in our operations due to evacuations, reduced ability to transport personnel to the drilling unit, or damage to our customers\u2019 platforms and other related facilities. Additionally, our customers may not choose to contract our rigs for use during hurricane season, particularly in the US GOM. Future severe weather could result in the loss or damage to our rigs or curtailment of our operations, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTaxing authorities may challenge our tax positions, and we may not be able to realize expected benefits.\nCurrent tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and treaties among various countries are currently under review or negotiation. Changes to these laws or interpretations could affect the taxes we pay in various jurisdictions. Our tax positions are subject to audit by relevant tax authorities who may disagree with our interpretations or assessments of the effects of tax laws, treaties, or regulations, or their applicability to our corporate structure or certain of our transactions we have undertaken. We could therefore incur material amounts of unrecorded income tax cost if our positions are challenged and we are unsuccessful in defending them.\nChanges in or non-compliance with tax laws and changes to our income tax estimates could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn 2012, we changed our legal domicile to the U.K. There are legislative proposals in the U.S. that attempt to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to U.S. subsidiaries of these corporations. The realization of the expected tax benefits of our redomestication could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other tax authorities. Changes in our effective tax rates as determined from time to time, the inability to realize anticipated tax benefits, or the imposition of additional taxes could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ultimate repatriation of earnings from the non-U.S. subsidiaries of Rowan Companies Inc. (RCI), a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company, to RCI, or by changes in applicable regulations and accounting principles.\nChanges in our recorded tax estimates (including estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions) may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We do not provide for deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of our non-U.K. subsidiaries, including RCI\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries. It is our policy and intention to permanently reinvest earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of RCI outside the U.S. Should the non-U.S. subsidiaries of RCI make a distribution from these earnings, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes.\nPolitical disturbances, war, or terrorist attacks and changes in global trade policies and economic sanctions could adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations are subject to political and economic risks and uncertainties, including instability resulting from civil unrest, political demonstrations, mass strikes, or an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas, which may result in extended business interruptions, suspended operations and danger to our employees, or result in claims by our customers of a force majeure situation and payment disputes. Additionally, we are subject to risks of terrorism, piracy, political instability, hostilities, expropriation, confiscation or deprivation of our assets or military action impacting our operations, assets or financial performance in many of our areas of operations.\nOperating and maintenance costs of our drilling units may be significant, and could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. In addition, operational interruptions or maintenance or repair work may cause our customers to suspend or reduce payment of day rates until operation is resumed, which may lead to loss of revenue or termination or renegotiation of the drilling contract.\nMost of our drilling contracts provide for the payment of a fixed day rate during periods of operation and reduced day rates during periods of other activities. Given current market conditions, we may not be able to negotiate day rates sufficient to cover increased or unanticipated costs. Our operating expenses and maintenance costs can be unpredictable, and depend on a variety of factors including: crew costs, costs of provisions, equipment, insurance, maintenance and repairs, customer and regulatory requirements, and shipyard costs, many of which are beyond our control. Our profit margins may therefore vary over the terms of our contracts, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers may be entitled to pay a waiting, or standby, rate lower than the full operational day rate if a drilling unit is idle for reasons that are not related to the ability of the rig to operate. In addition, if a drilling unit is taken out of service for maintenance and repair for a period of time exceeding the scheduled maintenance periods set forth in the drilling contract, we may not be entitled to payment of day rates until the unit is able to work. If the interruption of operations were to exceed a determined period, our customers may have the right to pay a rate that is significantly lower than the waiting rate for a period of time, and, thereafter, may terminate the drilling contracts related to the subject rig. Suspension of drilling contract payments, prolonged payment of reduced rates or termination of any drilling contract as a result of an interruption of operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur rig operating and maintenance costs include fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and day rates.\nWe do not expect our rig operating and maintenance costs to decline proportionately when rigs are not in service or when day rates decline. Fixed costs continue to accrue during out-of-service periods (such as shipyard stays and rig mobilizations preceding a contract), which represented approximately 2.7% of our available rig days in 2015. Operating revenue may fluctuate as rigs are recontracted at prevailing market rates upon termination of a contract, but costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only\nslightly variable regardless of the day rate being earned. Additionally, if our rigs are idle between contracts, we typically continue to incur operating and personnel costs because the crew is retained to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as some crew members may be required to assist in the rig's removal from service. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs may increase significantly.\nSupplier capacity constraints or shortages in parts or equipment, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our operations.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment used in our drilling operations exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain specialized parts and equipment we use in our operations may be available only from a single or small number of suppliers. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, defects or quality-control issues, recalls or other decreased availability or servicing of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, adversely impact our operations and revenues by resulting in uncompensated downtime, reduced day rates or the cancellation or termination of contracts, or increase our operating costs.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future, and some of our losses may not be covered by insurance.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for damage to our drilling rigs, third-party liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other types of loss or damage. There are some losses, however, for which insurance may not be available or only available at much higher prices. For example, we do not currently maintain named windstorm physical damage coverage on any of our drilling units located in the US GOM.\nOur insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions which must be met prior to any recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations.\nOur insurance program provides coverage for loss or damage to our drilling units on an agreed value basis (which varies by unit) subject to a deductible of $25 million per occurrence. This coverage does not include damage arising from a US GOM named windstorm, for which we are self-insured.\nWe also maintain insurance policies providing coverage for liability associated with negative environmental impacts of a sudden and accidental pollution event, third-party liability, employers\u2019 liability (including Jones Act liability), and automobile liability. These policies are also subject to various exclusions, deductibles and underlying limits. We maintain excess liability coverage with an annual aggregate limit of $700 million subject to a self-insured retention of $10 million, except for liabilities (including removal of wreck) arising out of US GOM named windstorms, which are subject to a self-insured retention of $200 million per occurrence.\nWe can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from potential consequences and damages, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future. A significant event which is not adequately covered by insurance and /or the failure of one or more of our insurance providers to meet claim obligations or losses or liabilities resulting from uninsured or underinsured events could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur contractual indemnification provisions may not be sufficient to cover our liabilities.\nOur drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification and allocation of liabilities between our customers and us with respect to liabilities resulting from various hazards associated with the drilling industry, such as loss of well control, well-bore pollution and damage to subsurface reservoirs and injury or death to personnel. The degree of indemnification we receive from operators against liabilities varies from contract to contract based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated. Our drilling contracts generally indemnify us for injuries and death of our customers\u2019 employees and loss or damage to our customers\u2019 property. Our service agreements generally indemnify us for injuries and death of our service providers\u2019 employees. However, the enforceability of our indemnities may be subject to differing interpretations, or further limited or prohibited under applicable law or by contract, particularly in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, punitive damages or punitive fines and/or penalties. For example, in 2012 a U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana invalidated certain contractual indemnities for punitive damages and for civil penalties in a drilling contract governed by U.S. maritime law as a matter of public policy. We could therefore be liable for certain liabilities even in cases where we have contractual indemnification rights. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations. The failure of a customer\nto meet its indemnification obligations, or losses or liabilities resulting from events excluded from or unenforceable under contractual indemnification obligations would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to retain highly skilled personnel could hurt our operations.\nWe require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our rigs and provide technical services and support for our operations. In the past, during periods of high demand for drilling services and increasing worldwide industry fleet size, shortages of qualified personnel have occurred. Such shortages could result in our loss of qualified personnel to competitors, impair the timeliness and quality of our work and create upward pressure on costs. If we are unable to retain or train skilled personnel, our operations and quality of service could be adversely impacted.\nWe are involved in litigation and legal proceedings from time to time that could have a negative effect on us if determined adversely.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings, which may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury, environmental, toxic tort, employment, tax and securities litigation, governmental investigations or proceedings, and litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Although we intend to defend any of these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter. Our profitability may be adversely affected by the outcome of claims or contract disputes, including any inability to collect receivables or resolve significant contractual or day rate disputes, and any purported nullification, cancellation or breach of contracts with customers or other parties. Litigation may have an adverse effect on us because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with defending the lawsuits, the diversion of resources, reputational damage, and other factors.\nOur ability to access the credit and debt capital markets may be restricted. We may experience a downgrade in our credit ratings.\nOur ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet our financial and operating needs is dependent upon our future performance, operating cash flows, and our access to credit and debt capital markets. In turn, our level of liquidity and access to credit and debt capital markets depends on general economic conditions, industry cycles, financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, as well as our credit ratings. Tightening in the credit markets due to the current economic environment and concerns about the offshore drilling industry may restrict our access to the credit and debt capital markets and increase the cost of such indebtedness. Our future cash flows and access to capital may be insufficient to meet all of our capital requirements, debt obligations and contractual commitments, and any insufficiency could have an adverse impact on our business.\nCredit rating agencies may also downgrade our credit ratings to non-investment grade levels at any time. A downgrade in our ratings below investment grade could have adverse consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:\n\u2022\nRestrict our ability to access credit and debt capital markets;\n\u2022\nCause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nPay increased fees under our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nNegatively impact current and prospective customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us;\n\u2022\nImpose additional insurance, guarantee and collateral requirements; or\n\u2022\nLimit our access to bank and third-party guarantees, surety bonds and letters of credit.\nWe depend heavily upon the security and reliability of our technology systems and those of our service providers, and such systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nWe depend heavily on technologies, systems and networks that we manage, and others that are managed by our third-party service and equipment providers, to conduct our business and operations. Cybersecurity risks and threats to such systems continue to grow in sophisticated ways that avoid detection and may be difficult to anticipate, prevent or mitigate. If any of our or our service or equipment providers\u2019 security systems for protecting against cybersecurity breaches or failures prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business and financial systems compromised, our companies\u2019, employees\u2019, vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our (or our customers\u2019) business operations or safety procedures disrupted, degraded or damaged. A breach or failure could also result in injury (financial or otherwise) to people, loss of control of, or damage to, our (or our customers\u2019) assets, harm to the environment, reputational damage, breaches of laws or regulations, litigation and other legal liabilities. In addition, we may incur significant costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity risks or events and to defend against any investigations, litigation or other proceedings that may follow such events. Such a failure or breach of our systems could adversely and materially impact our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology disputes could negatively impact our operations or increase our costs.\nDrilling rigs use proprietary technology and equipment which can involve potential infringement of a third party\u2019s rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our jack-ups and drillships are owned by us or our suppliers or sub-suppliers, however, in the event that we or one of our suppliers or sub-suppliers becomes involved in a dispute over infringement rights relating to equipment owned or used by us, we may lose access to repair services or replacement parts, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or forced to modify our jack-ups or drillships. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment. Technology disputes involving us or our suppliers or sub-suppliers could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nTransocean holds U.S. and other patents for dual activity drilling equipment and has pursued litigation against several other offshore drilling contractors. Transocean could choose to sue us or our customers for infringing its patents if it believes that we are using technology covered by its patent on our drillships, and we could be forced to modify our drillships and/or pay royalties to Transocean in the event that a Court were to find that any Transocean patents are infringed.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws could result in fines, criminal penalties and drilling contract terminations and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (UK Bribery Act) and similar laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operated and may in the future operate in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Any failure to comply with the FCPA, UK Bribery Act, or other anti-corruption laws due to our own acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of others, including our partners, agents or vendors, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which would adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participation in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling units or other assets.\nUnionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nCertain of our employees and contractors in international markets such as Trinidad and Norway are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. Further, efforts may be made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. In addition, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenues or limit our operations.\nThe enforcement of civil liabilities against Rowan plc may be more difficult.\nBecause Rowan plc is a public limited company incorporated under English law, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against Rowan plc in U.S. courts than would be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. In addition, it may be more difficult to bring some types of claims against Rowan plc in courts in the U.K. than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.\nOur articles of association include mandatory offer provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing hostile takeovers, including those that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our shares, and discouraging, delaying or preventing changes in control or management.\nAlthough Rowan plc is not currently subject to the U.K. Takeover Code, certain provisions similar to the mandatory offer provisions and certain other aspects of the U.K. Takeover Code are included in our articles of association. As a result, among other matters, a Rowan plc shareholder, that together with persons acting in concert, acquired 30 percent or more of our issued shares without making an offer to all of our other shareholders that is in cash or accompanied by a cash alternative would be at risk of certain Board sanctions unless they acted with the consent of our Board or the prior approval of the shareholders. The ability of shareholders to retain their shares upon completion of a mandatory offer may depend on whether the offeror subsequently causes us to propose a court-approved scheme of arrangement that would compel minority shareholders to transfer or surrender their shares in favor of the offeror or, if the offeror has acquired at least 90 percent of the relevant shares, the offeror requires minority shareholders to accept the offer under the \u2018squeeze-out\u2019 provisions in our articles of association. The mandatory offer provisions in our articles of association could have the effect of discouraging the acquisition and holding of interests of 30 percent or more of issued shares and encouraging those shareholders who may be acting in concert with respect to the acquisition of shares to seek to obtain the\nconsent of our Board before effecting any additional purchases. In addition, these provisions may adversely affect the market price of our shares or inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could otherwise result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\nAs a result of increased shareholder approval requirements, we may have less flexibility as a U.K. public limited company than as a Delaware corporation with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\nUnder Delaware law, directors may issue, without further stockholder approval, any shares authorized in a company\u2019s certificate of incorporation that are not already issued or reserved. Delaware law also provides substantial flexibility in establishing the terms of preferred shares. However, English law provides that a board of directors may generally only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders; such authorization must state the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted and may only be for a maximum period of five years.\nEnglish law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash while Delaware law does not. However, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in a general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the exclusion.\nEnglish law also generally prohibits us from repurchasing our shares on the open market, and prohibits us from repurchasing our shares by way of \u201coff-market purchases\u201d without the prior approval of shareholders by special resolution (i.e., 75 percent of votes cast), which approval lasts for a maximum period of five years.\nPrior to the redomestication, resolutions were adopted to authorize the allotment of a certain amount of shares, exclude certain preemptive rights and permit off market purchases, in each case without further shareholder approval, but these authorizations will expire in 2017 unless further approved by our shareholders prior to the expiration date.\nWe cannot assure you that situations will not arise where U.K. shareholder approval requirements for the extension or expansion of any of these actions would deprive our shareholders of substantial capital management benefits.\nEnglish law requires that we meet certain additional financial requirements before we declare dividends and return funds to shareholders.\nUnder English law, we are only able to declare dividends and make other distributions to our shareholders out of the accumulated distributable reserves on our parent company's statutory balance sheet. Distributable reserves are a company\u2019s accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses (including asset impairments), so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. The parent's sources of income include service agreements between the parent and certain indirect subsidiaries and the remittance of profit of the parent's direct subsidiary in the form of dividends.\nEnglish law also provides that a public company can only make a distribution if, among other things (a) the amount of its net assets (that is, the excess of total assets over liabilities) is not less than the total of its called-up share capital and non-distributable reserves and (b) if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that total.\nWe may be unable to remit the profits of our subsidiaries in a timely or tax efficient manner. If at any time we do not have sufficient distributable reserves to declare and pay quarterly dividends, Rowan plc may undertake a reduction in its capital, in addition to the reduction in capital taken in 2014, to reduce the amount of our share capital and non-distributable reserves and to create a corresponding increase in our distributable reserves out of which future distributions to shareholders can be made. To comply with English law, a reduction of capital would be subject to (a) approval of shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting by special resolution; (b) confirmation by an order of the English Courts and (c) the Court order being delivered to and registered by the Registrar of Companies in England. If we were to pursue a reduction of capital as a course of action, and failed to obtain the necessary approvals from shareholders and the English Courts, we may undertake other efforts to allow Rowan plc to declare dividends or make other distributions to shareholders.", "PERMNO": 45495, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "RDC"}
