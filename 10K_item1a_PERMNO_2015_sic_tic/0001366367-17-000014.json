{"cik": "1366367", "company": "YADKIN FINANCIAL Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves certain risks. If any of the following risks or other risks, which have not been identified or which we may believe are immaterial or unlikely, actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks identified below and this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us as described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial information reflects the application of the acquisition method of accounting. Any change in the assumptions used in such methodology could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs a result of various prior bank and bank holding company acquisitions, our financial results are heavily influenced by the application of the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires management to make assumptions regarding the assets purchased and liabilities assumed to determine their fair value. Management\u2019s assumptions or valuations may not be accurate. In addition, the balances of nonperforming assets were significantly reduced by the adjustments to fair value recorded in conjunction with the various acquisitions. If our fair value assumptions were incorrect or the regulatory agencies to whom we report require us to change or modify our assumptions, such change or modification could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or our previously reported results. Since our strategy includes additional acquisitions, we expect we would be further subject to such risk on a going forward basis.\n- 18 -\nWithin our loan and purchased accounts receivable portfolios, we may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans or other receivables. A customer\u2019s failure to repay us is usually preceded by missed monthly payments. In some instances, however, a customer may declare bankruptcy prior to missing payments, and, following a borrower filing bankruptcy, a lender\u2019s recovery of the credit extended is often limited. Since many of our loans are secured by collateral, we may attempt to foreclose the collateral when and if customers default on their loans. However, the value of the collateral may not equal the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. The resolution of nonperforming assets, including the initiation of foreclosure proceedings, requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, and will expose us to additional legal and other costs and potential delays. Elevated levels of loan delinquencies and bankruptcies in our market area and among our customers can be indicative of future charge-offs and may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses (\u201cALLL\u201d) or valuation allowances. Higher charge-off rates, delays in the foreclosure process or in obtaining judgments against defaulting borrowers, and increases in our ALLL for loans or valuation allowances for purchased accounts receivable may hurt our overall financial performance.\nThe effects of economic instability on the performance of financial institutions in our geographic area, actions taken by our competitors to address economic instability, and the public perception of and confidence in the economy generally, and the banking industry specifically, could negatively impact our performance and operations.\nAll financial institutions are subject to similar risks resulting from economic instability, such as increased charge-offs and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. As troubled institutions in our market area continue to recognize and dispose of problem assets, excessive inventories of residential homes and lots may negatively affect home values and increase the time it takes us or our borrowers to sell existing inventory. The perception that troubled banking institutions (and smaller banking institutions that are not \u201cin trouble\u201d) are risky institutions for purposes of regulatory compliance or safeguarding deposits may cause depositors to move their funds to larger institutions that are perceived to be less risky. If our depositors should move their funds based on events at other financial institutions, our operating results would suffer.\nOur loan portfolio mix could result in increased credit risk in a challenging economy.\nOur loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial business loans. These types of loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments. In fact, the FDIC has issued pronouncements alerting banks of its concern about heavy loan concentrations in certain types of commercial real estate loans, including acquisition, construction and development loans, and also by geographic segment. Because our loan portfolio contains commercial real estate and commercial business loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in our nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current economic environment and any deterioration or downturn in the economies or real estate values in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on both borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and the value of the real property securing such loans. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans would then be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-going correction in real estate markets, including reduced levels of home sales and declines in the performance of loans.\nThere continues to be a general real estate slowdown in some of our market areas, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories. As a result, home builders and commercial developers have shown signs of financial deterioration for prolonged periods before recovery. A soft residential housing market, increased delinquency rates, and a weakened secondary credit market have affected the overall mortgage industry and have impacted in the past and could in the future adversely affect our Builder Finance Division. In addition, many banking institutions, including our Bank, have experienced declines in the performance of other loans, including construction, land development and land loans and commercial loans. We make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of borrowers or projects combined with our expectations for the future. If conditions are worse than forecasted, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies beyond that which is provided in the allowance for loan losses. As such, our earnings could be adversely affected through higher than anticipated provisions for loan losses.\n- 19 -\nSBA lending is an important part of our business. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government, and we have specific risks associated with originating SBA loans.\nOur SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government. As an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender\u2019s Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as a Preferred Lender, we may lose our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we would experience a material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, including changes to the level of guarantee provided by the federal government on SBA loans, may also have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe generally sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in our earning premium income and/or have created a stream of future servicing income. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue originating these loans, that a secondary market will exist or that we will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans. When we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans. We share pro-rata with the SBA in any recoveries. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. In certain situations, we may elect to repurchase previously sold portions of SBA 7(a) loans that are delinquent, which may result in higher levels of nonperforming loans.\nIf our ALLL is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the quality of our assets, particularly loans. In originating loans, there is a substantial likelihood that we will experience credit losses. The risk of loss will vary with, among other things, general economic conditions, including the current economic environment and real estate market, the type of loan, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the quality of the collateral for the loan.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We maintain an ALLL in an attempt to cover any loan losses that may occur. In determining the size of the ALLL, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information.\nIf our assumptions are wrong, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses, and we may need to make adjustments to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. We expect our ALLL to continue to fluctuate; however, given current and future market conditions, we can make no assurance that our allowance will be adequate to cover future loan losses.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our ALLL and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulators could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nThe amount of other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) may increase significantly, resulting in additional losses, and costs and expenses that will negatively affect our operations.\nAs the amount of OREO increases, our losses, and the costs and expenses to maintain the real estate, likewise increase. The amount of OREO we hold may increase due to various economic conditions or other factors. Any additional increase in losses and maintenance costs and expenses due to OREO may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Such effects may be particularly pronounced in a market of reduced real estate values and excess inventory, which may make the disposition of OREO properties more difficult, increase maintenance costs and expenses, and may reduce our ultimate realization from any OREO sales. In addition, at acquisition of the OREO we are required to reflect the fair market value in our financial statements. If the OREO declines in value subsequent to its acquisition, we are required to recognize a loss. As a result, declines in the value of our OREO have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n- 20 -\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property or how to value such a loan in the future may not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral that we can realize.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values in our market area have experienced changes in value in relatively short periods of time, especially given heightened economic uncertainty, this estimate might not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral after the loan has been closed. If the appraisal does not accurately reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our OREO and to determine certain loan impairments. If these valuations are inaccurate, our consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of OREO, and our ALLL may not reflect accurate loan impairments. The valuation of the property may negatively impact the continuing value of such loan and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $1.03 billion. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, monetary policy changes by the Federal Reserve, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected.\nYadkin and FNB have operated and, until the completion of the FNB Merger, will continue to operate independently. The success of the FNB Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on FNB\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of FNB and Yadkin in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the FNB Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Yadkin\u2019s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on Yadkin\u2019s financial results and the value of the Yadkin common stock. If FNB experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the FNB Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause FNB and/or Yadkin to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from FNB and/or Yadkin and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. In addition, the actual cost savings of the FNB Merger could be less than anticipated.\nThe FNB Merger is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the FNB Merger not being completed. Termination of the FNB Merger Agreement could negatively impact Yadkin.\nThe FNB Merger is subject to customary conditions to closing. If any condition to the FNB Merger is not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law, including the absence of any materially burdensome condition in the regulatory approvals, the FNB Merger may not be completed. In addition, either FNB or Yadkin may terminate the FNB Merger Agreement under certain circumstances even if the FNB Merger is adopted by the Yadkin shareholders, including but not limited to, if the FNB Merger has not been completed on or before May 31, 2017.\nIf the FNB Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, Yadkin\u2019s businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the FNB Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the FNB Merger. Additionally, if the FNB Merger Agreement is\n- 21 -\nterminated, the market price of Yadkin\u2019s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the FNB Merger will be completed.\nFNB and Yadkin will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the FNB Merger is pending.\nThe FNB Merger Agreement restricts Yadkin from operating its business other than in the ordinary course and prohibits Yadkin from taking specified actions without FNB\u2019s consent until the FNB Merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent Yadkin from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the FNB Merger. In addition, uncertainty about the effect of the FNB Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Yadkin. These uncertainties may impair Yadkin\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the FNB Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Yadkin to seek to change existing business relationships with Yadkin. Retention of certain employees by Yadkin may be challenging while the FNB Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Yadkin. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Yadkin, Yadkin\u2019s business could be harmed.\nThe uncertainty caused by the pending FNB Merger could cause Yadkin\u2019s clients and business associates to seek to change their existing business relationships with Yadkin. These uncertainties may impair Yadkin\u2019s ability to attract, retain and grow Yadkin\u2019s client base until the FNB Merger is complete.\nThe market value of the merger consideration that Yadkin shareholders will receive as a result of the FNB Merger may fluctuate.\nIf the FNB Merger is completed, each share of the Yadkin common stock will be converted into the right to receive 2.16 shares of FNB common stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The market value of the merger consideration may vary from the closing price of FNB common stock on the date the FNB Merger was announced, on the date that the proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to the Yadkin shareholders, on the date of the special meeting of the Yadkin shareholders, on the date the FNB Merger is consummated and thereafter. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the respective businesses, operations and prospects, and the regulatory situation of FNB and Yadkin. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Yadkin. Any change in the market price of FNB common stock prior to completion of the FNB Merger will affect the amount of and the market value of the merger consideration that Yadkin shareholders will receive upon completion of the FNB Merger. Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting, the Yadkin shareholders were not able to calculate the amount or the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the FNB Merger.\nFurther, the results of operations of the combined company following the FNB Merger and the market price of the combined company\u2019s shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of FNB and Yadkin.\nIf the FNB Merger is not completed, Yadkin will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the FNB Merger.\nYadkin has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the FNB Merger Agreement, including a portion of the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the FNB Merger. If the FNB Merger is not completed, Yadkin would have to recognize its portion of these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the FNB Merger.\nThe FNB Merger Agreement limits Yadkin\u2019s ability to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal and could require Yadkin to pay a termination fee of $45 million under certain circumstances relating to alternative acquisition proposals.\nThe FNB Merger Agreement prohibits Yadkin from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging certain alternative acquisition proposals with any third party, subject to exceptions set forth in the FNB Merger Agreement. The FNB Merger Agreement also provides for the payment by Yadkin to FNB of a termination fee in the amount of $45 million (and, in some cases, FNB\u2019s documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the FNB Merger) in the event that Yadkin or FNB terminates the FNB Merger Agreement for certain specified reasons. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Yadkin from considering or proposing such an acquisition.\nDamage resulting from Hurricane Matthew could have a negative impact on the Company's credit risk.\n- 22 -\nMany communities in Southern and Eastern North Carolina suffered significant damage resulting from Hurricane Matthew. At this time, it is unclear to what extent Yadkin customers have been affected by uninsured business interruption, property destruction and other related losses, and how those events may affect each customer's ability to meet its debt service obligations.\nChanges in the interest rate environment could reduce our net interest income, which could reduce our profitability.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings significantly depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes in federal fiscal and monetary policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates in December 2015 from near-zero interest rates. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have material adverse effects on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition from larger, more established competitors.\nThe banking industry is highly competitive, and we experience strong competition from many other financial institutions, including some of the largest commercial banks in the United States. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other financial institutions that operate in our primary market areas and elsewhere. We expect competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans, primarily on the basis of the interest rates we pay and yield on these products. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, much larger financial institutions. While we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions in our markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size and lack of geographic diversification. Further, should we fail to maintain an adequate volume of loans and deposits in accordance with our business strategy, it could have an adverse effect on our profitability in the future.\nAs a community bank, we have different lending risks than larger banks.\nOur ability to diversify our economic risks is limited by our own local markets and economies. We lend primarily to individuals and to small- to medium-sized businesses, which may expose us to greater lending risks than those of banks lending to larger, better-capitalized businesses with longer operating histories. Small- and medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the markets in which we operate, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe manage our credit exposure through careful monitoring of loan applicants and loan concentrations in particular industries, and through loan approval and review procedures. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses is an estimate based on experience, judgment and expectations regarding our borrowers, and the economies in which we and our borrowers operate, as well as the judgment of our regulators. We cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, profitability or financial condition.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors, could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to our quarterly or annual results, annual projections and the impact of these risk factors on our operating results or financial position.\n- 23 -\nHurricanes, excessive rainfall, droughts or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe economy of the coastal regions of North Carolina and South Carolina are affected, from time to time, by adverse weather events, particularly hurricanes. Our market area includes the Outer Banks and other portions of coastal North Carolina. Agricultural interests are highly sensitive to excessive rainfall or droughts. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent damage caused by future weather conditions will affect our operations, our customers, or the economies in our banking markets. Weather events could cause a disruption in our day-to-day business activities in branches located in coastal communities, a decline in loan originations, destruction or decline in the value of properties securing our loans, or an increase in the risks of delinquencies, foreclosures, and loan losses. Even if a hurricane does not cause any physical damage in our market area, a turbulent hurricane season could significantly affect the market value of all coastal property.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk in our operations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of being unable, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances, to pay obligations as they come due, to capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or to pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, mortgage originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations, and access to other funding sources. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, given the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations in the domestic and worldwide credit markets. Our access to borrowed funds could become limited in the future, and we may be required to pay above market rates for additional borrowed funds, if we are able to obtain them at all, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third party service providers, including cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure data processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber attacks, electronic fraudulent activity, or attempted theft of financial assets. We cannot assure you that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be quickly detected and adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints on the part of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses, or other financial intermediaries. We also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\n- 24 -\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDeterioration in the soundness of our counterparties could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and stability of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could create a market-wide liquidity crisis similar to that experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. There is no assurance that the failure of our counterparties would not materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations; we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. We expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our customers by our chief executive officer and other senior officers. The unexpected loss of any of our key employees could have an adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings. The implementation of our business strategy will also require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate, and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services. Many experienced banking professionals employed by our competitors are covered by agreements not to compete or solicit their existing customers if they were to leave their current employment. These agreements make the recruitment of these professionals more difficult. The market for these people is competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, hiring, motivating or retaining them.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate.\nIn reviewing the accounting for the allowance for loan losses, management has determined that, as of the date of this filing, we have a control deficiency resulting in a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP, has expressed an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting because of the material weakness. There is a reasonable possibility that our material weakness could lead to a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements not being prevented or detected in a timely manner.\nOur material weakness relates specifically to the Company\u2019s internal control processes lacking adequate precision in the estimation of the allowance for loan loss. If we are unable to remedy the material weakness, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC, could be adversely effected. The occurrence of or failure to remediate the material weakness may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our common stock and any other securities we may issues. See \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for more information.\n- 25 -\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or omission. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion by two or more people and/or by override of the established controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control systems and in human nature, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards and management\u2019s selection of accounting methods, including assumptions and estimates, could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. In addition, management is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates are incorrect, we may experience unexpected material consequences.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans sold into the secondary market.\nWe have entered into agreements to sell mortgage loans into the secondary market. These agreements typically require that we repurchase the loan in the event of a default. If we are required to repurchase a large number of mortgage loans from secondary market investors, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDeterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our subsidiary\u2019s banking operations.\nThe long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of the credit rating of the U.S. government and federal agencies. In addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failure to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In particular, such circumstances could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. Also, the adverse consequences could extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax and other laws and regulations.\n- 26 -\nThe United States Congress and the President's Administration have indicated an interest in reforming the internal revenue code. Possible approaches include lowering the corporate income tax rate and limiting or eliminating various other deductions, tax credits and other tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to determine what changes may be made and to quantify either the one-time impacts from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might result from tax reform or the ongoing impact reform proposals might have on income tax expense.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research reports about us, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If there is limited or no securities or industry analyst coverage of us, the market price for our stock would be negatively impacted. Moreover, if any of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common stock, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nSales or issuances of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price prevailing from time to time. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of an equity offering, including the issuance of a large block of shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, or the perception that such sales could occur.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including the declaration and payment of cash dividends to shareholders, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits, and locations of offices. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth and operations. Should we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, federal and state regulators could impose additional restrictions on the activities of the Company and the Bank, which could materially affect our growth strategy and operating results in the future.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry have recently changed and may continue to change, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe implications of the Dodd-Frank Act, or its implementing regulations, on our business remain somewhat uncertain at this time, but it may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and the underlying value of our securities. The full effect of this legislation will not be reasonably certain until implementing regulations are promulgated, which could take several years in some cases.\nSome or all of the changes, including the new rulemaking authority granted to the CFPB, may result in greater reporting requirements, assessment fees, operational restrictions, capital requirements, and other regulatory burdens for either, or both, the Bank and the Company, and many of our non-bank competitors may remain free from such limitations. This disparity could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain depositors, to offer competitive products and services, and to expand our business.\nCongress may consider additional proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system and to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies. Such legislation may change existing banking statutes and regulations, as well as our current operating environment significantly. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand our permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings\n- 27 -\nassociations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand, or business and earnings.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result in higher regulatory and compliance costs related to originating and servicing mortgages and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe CFPB has issued a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the residential mortgage business. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The final rules require banks to, among other things: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new \u201creasonable ability to repay\u201d test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a \u201cqualified mortgage;\u201d (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower\u2019s principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator compensation; and (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for \u201chigher priced mortgage loans.\u201d\nOur compliance with the CFPB rules, and its accompanying enforcement by our federal and state regulators, will create operational and strategic challenges for us, as we originate a significant volume of mortgages. Additional rules affecting the residential mortgage business are expected. Achieving full compliance will result in increased regulatory and compliance costs.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future, including through new increased minimum capital thresholds established by our regulators as part of their implementation of Basel III, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, and on July 9, 2013, the FDIC, adopted a final rule that implements the Basel III changes to the international regulatory capital framework, referred to as the \u201cBasel III Rules.\u201d\nThe minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the Basel III Rules are: (i) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital to total assets of 4.5 percent; (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 risk-based capital to total assets of 6 percent; and (iii) a ratio of total risk-based capital to total assets of 8 percent.\nThe Basel III Rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5 percent above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 percent, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 percent, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 percent. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffer amount.\nThe Basel III rules also establish minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets, of 3 percent for bank holding companies that meet specified criteria. All other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent. The Company\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratio as of December 31, 2016 was 9.83 percent compared to 9.42 percent at December 31, 2015. The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a \u201ctangible Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio\u201d and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. The Federal Reserve has not advised the Company of any additional specific minimum leverage ratio or tangible Tier 1 capital leverage ratio applicable to it.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDI Act, requires the federal regulatory agencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d if a depository institution does not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDI Act establishes five capital tiers: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d A depository institution\u2019s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.\n- 28 -\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had capital levels that qualify as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under such regulations.\nThe FDI Act generally prohibits an FDIC-insured bank from making a capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank would thereafter be \u201cundercapitalized.\u201d \u201cUndercapitalized\u201d banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The federal regulators may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank\u2019s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable to regulators, the bank\u2019s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of: (i) an amount equal to 5 percent of the bank\u2019s total assets at the time it became \u201cundercapitalized\u201d; and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is \u201csignificantly undercapitalized.\u201d\n\u201cSignificantly undercapitalized\u201d insured banks may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d requirements to reduce total assets and the cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. \u201cCritically undercapitalized\u201d institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. A bank that is not \u201cwell capitalized\u201d is also subject to certain limitations relating to brokered deposits.\nCertain Basel III Rules became effective January 1, 2015. The conservation buffer phase in period began in 2016 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2019. Certain calculations under the Basel III Rules will also have phase-in periods.\nThe FDIC Deposit Insurance assessments that we are required to pay may continue to materially increase in the future, which would have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nAs a member institution of the FDIC, we are assessed a quarterly deposit insurance premium. Failed banks nationwide have significantly depleted the insurance fund and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result, we may be required to pay significantly higher premiums or additional special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings.\nOn October 19, 2010, the FDIC adopted a Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) Restoration Plan, which requires the DIF to attain a 1.35 percent reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. In addition, the FDIC modified the method by which assessments are determined and, effective April 1, 2011, adjusted assessment rates, which will range from 2.5 to 45 basis points (annualized), subject to adjustments for unsecured debt and, in the case of small institutions outside the lowest risk category and certain large and highly complex institutions, brokered deposits. Further increased FDIC assessment premiums, due to our risk classification, emergency assessments, or implementation of the modified DIF reserve ratio, could adversely impact our earnings.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on our securities is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends.\nWe make no assurances that we will pay any dividends on our securities in the future. Any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, regulatory restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. The holders of our capital stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if, declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. As part of our consideration to pay cash dividends, we intend to retain adequate funds from future earnings to support the development and growth of our business. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by federal policies and regulations. It is the current policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on capital stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition. Further, our principal source of funds to pay dividends is cash dividends that we receive from the Bank, which, in turn, will be highly dependent upon the Bank\u2019s historical and projected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, as well as various legal and regulatory prohibitions and other restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, extend credit or otherwise transfer funds to the Company.\n- 29 -\nAnti-takeover provisions could adversely affect our shareholders.\nProvisions of North Carolina law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (our \u201cBylaws\u201d) could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. For example, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, which could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. There are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies. With certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or Company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10 percent (5 percent if the acquirer is a bank holding Company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our Company without prior notice or application to, and the approval of, the Federal Reserve Board. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our shareholders.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $367.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our financial condition, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 30 -", "PERMNO": 89481, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "YDKN"}
