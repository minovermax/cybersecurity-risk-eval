{"cik": "931584", "company": "UNIVERSAL STAINLESS & ALLOY PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe wish to caution each reader of this Form 10-K to consider the following factors and other factors discussed herein and in other past reports, including but not limited to prior year Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the SEC. Our business and results of operations could be materially affected by any of the following risks. The factors discussed herein are not exhaustive. Therefore, the factors contained herein should be read together with other reports that we file with the SEC from time to time, which may supplement, modify, supersede, or update the factors listed in this document.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nOur business and operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers, have been and are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 was declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic\u201d and spread across the world, including the United States and many countries where the Company sells its products or sources raw materials.\nOur operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity, disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are unknown, its impact on our operations and financial performance cannot be fully determined. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to, governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures)\u037e the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel and economic activity\u037e general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility\u037e global economic conditions and levels of economic growth\u037e commodity prices; vaccination activities; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\nNotwithstanding our continued operations, we have experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for our products, including delivery and shipping delays and deferrals directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic that have adversely impacted, and are expected to continue to adversely impact, our business. For example, a significant portion of our sales result from products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace industry. In 2020 and 2021, several commercial aerospace companies announced and executed cost-cutting and other measures in response to declining demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, including measures to reduce inventory and/or downward adjustments to their production rates. Likewise, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated declines in consumer activity and supply issues in the oil & gas end market. Although our order backlog increased in 2021, economic and global supply chain and disruption continues, which continues to have a significant adverse impact on our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\nAs the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity position in relation to our anticipated future liquidity needs. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement (as defined below), our borrowing availability is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, which have been impacted and will continue to be impacted by the challenging economic environment we have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, a continued worldwide disruption could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, financial condition, capitalization and capital investments. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. Additionally, a prolonged period of generating lower cash from operations could adversely affect our financial condition and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Conditions in the financial and credit markets also may limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global economic and market factors.\nOur results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our customers and our suppliers, which in turn is affected by global economic and market factors, including health epidemics, impacting the industries and markets that we participate in. We are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States and abroad that may affect the general economic climate, our performance and the demand of our customers. We may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate. There can be no assurance that global economic and market conditions will not adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow or financial position in the future.\nExisting free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particularly increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we sell products or purchase materials could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of current, proposed, or future imposed tariffs, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs on the Company will be successful.\nCommercial Risks\nA substantial amount of our sales is derived from a limited number of customers.\nOur five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and 54% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. An adverse change in, or termination of, the relationship with one or more of our customers or market segments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is very competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales.\nWe compete with domestic and foreign producers of specialty steel products. In addition, many of the finished products sold by our customers are in direct competition with finished products manufactured by foreign sources, which may affect the demand for those customers\u2019 products. Any competitive factors that adversely affect the market for finished products manufactured by us or our customers could indirectly adversely affect the demand for our semi-finished products. Additionally, our products compete with products fashioned from alternative materials such as aluminum, composites and plastics, the production of which includes domestic and foreign enterprises. Competition in our field is intense and is expected to continue to be so in the foreseeable future. A majority of our business is not covered under long term supply contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.\nThe demand for our products may be cyclical.\nDemand for our products from our customers can be cyclical in nature and sensitive to various factors, including demand, production schedules and other conditions in each of our end markets, fluctuations in inventory levels throughout the supply chain, and general macroeconomic conditions. A significant adverse change in demand for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA substantial amount of our sales is derived from the aerospace industry.\nApproximately 60% of our sales represented products sold to customers in the aerospace market in 2021. The aerospace market is historically cyclical due to both external and internal market factors. These factors include general economic conditions, supply chain fluctuations, diminished credit availability, airline profitability, demand for air travel, age of fleets, varying fuel and labor costs, price competition, new technology development and international and domestic political conditions such as military conflict and the threat of terrorism. The length and degree of cyclical fluctuation can be influenced by any one or a combination of these factors and therefore are difficult to predict with certainty.\nA prolonged downturn in the aerospace industry would adversely affect the demand for our products and/or the prices at which we are able to sell our products, and our results of operations, business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The continued market uncertainty regarding impacts of COVID-19 on the aerospace business, has and could continue to adversely impact our results.\nOur business may be harmed by failure to develop, commercialize, market and sell new applications and new products.\nWe believe that our alloys and metallurgical manufacturing expertise provide us with a competitive advantage over other high-performance alloy producers. Our ability to maintain this competitive advantage depends on our ability to continue to offer products that have equal or better performance characteristics than competing products at competitive prices. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop, commercialize and sell new products. If we are not successful in these efforts, or if our new products and product enhancements do not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business requires continuing efforts to obtain new customer approvals on existing products and applications, which is a stringent, difficult process subject to each customer\u2019s varying approval methodology and preferences. If we are not successful in these efforts, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our international sales and purchases are associated with various risks.\nWe conduct business with suppliers and customers in foreign countries which exposes us to risks associated with international business activities, including effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from membership in the European Union (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). We could be significantly impacted by these risks, which include the potential for volatile economic and labor conditions, political instability, collecting accounts receivable and exchange rate fluctuations (which may affect sales revenue to international customers and the margins on international sales when converted into U.S. dollars).\nInternational sales approximated 7% of annual net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, an immaterial portion of which is denominated in foreign currencies.\nFinancial Risks\nOur business may be harmed if we are unable to meet our debt service requirements or the covenants in our Credit Agreement, or if interest rates increase.\nWe have debt upon which we are required to make scheduled interest and principal payments, and we may incur additional debt in the future. A significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates that may increase in the future. A significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, and could increase the cost of our borrowings.\nOur Credit Agreement uses the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on a substantial portion of our debt. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR. In March 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative: (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar settings; and (b) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings. The United States Federal Reserve has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the LIBOR benchmarks is anticipated in coming years. Accordingly, the outcome of these reforms is uncertain, and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In addition, we may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using any of various hedging instruments. These instruments may be used to selectively manage risks, but there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against material interest rate fluctuations.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets that we serve and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or if interest rates increase, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our Credit Agreement, which provides for a $105.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $15.0 million senior secured term loan facility, also requires us to comply with certain covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement could result in a default, which, if not waived by our lenders, could substantially increase our borrowing costs and result in acceleration of our debt. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants in our Credit Agreement.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are a U.S. based company with customers and suppliers in foreign countries. We import various raw materials used in our production processes and we export goods to our foreign customers. The United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business have implemented and may consider further changes in relevant tax, border tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, that may unfavorably impact our effective tax rate or result in other costs to us.\nOur ability to recognize tax benefits on our existing net operating loss positions may be limited.\nWe have generated meaningful net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and other tax attributes (collectively, the \u201cTax Benefits\u201d), which potentially can be utilized in certain circumstances to reduce our future income tax obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had estimated U.S. federal net operating losses of approximately $29.2 million, state net operating losses of approximately $10.8 million, U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6.4 million and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $0.4 million. Our ability to use our Tax Benefits would be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cTax Code\u201d). In general, a corporation would experience an ownership change if the percentage of the corporation\u2019s stock owned by one or more \u201c5% shareholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Tax Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. On August 24, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d) designed to protect the availability of our Tax Benefits and the Rights Agreement was ratified by our shareholders on May 5, 2021. The Rights Agreement contains an ownership trigger threshold of 4.95% and reduces the likelihood that changes in our investor base would limit our future use\nof our Tax Benefits, which would significantly impair the value of such Tax Benefits. However, there is no guarantee that the Rights Agreement will be effective in protecting our Tax Benefits. Further, if we continue to be unable to generate sufficient taxable income, these Tax Benefits may expire unutilized, and we may not be able to recognize the benefits that could arise from such Tax Benefits.\nHuman Capital Risks\nOur business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe depend on the continued service, availability and ability to attract skilled personnel, including members of our executive management team, other management positions, and metallurgists, along with maintenance and production positions. Our inability to attract and retain such people may adversely impact our ability to fill existing roles and support growth. Attraction and retention of qualified personnel remains challenging as the labor market remains tight.\nFurther, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to perform until suitable replacements can be found.\nOur business may be harmed by strikes or work stoppages.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had 421 employees, out of a total of 558, who were covered under collective bargaining agreements with the USW expiring at various dates in 2022 to 2025. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in timely concluding collective bargaining agreements with the USW to succeed the agreements that expire, in which case, we may experience strikes or work stoppages that may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCosts related to our participation in a multi-employer pension plan could increase significantly.\nWe participate in the Trust, a multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan. We make contributions to the Trust with respect to all hourly and salaried employees associated with our Bridgeville facility. The trustees of the Trust have provided us with the latest data available for the Trust year ended December 31, 2020. As of that date, the Trust is not fully funded. Our contribution rates could increase if the Trust is required to adopt a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan as a result of funding deficiencies in excess of specified levels, which may be due to poor performance of Trust investments or other factors, or as a result of future wage and benefit agreements. In addition, if we choose to stop participating in the Trust, our contributions to the Trust decline or the Trust is terminated, we may be required to pay the Trust an amount based on the underfunded status of the Trust, referred to as a withdrawal liability. Changes to any of these factors could negatively impact our future results of operations and cash flows to a material extent.\nOperational Risks\nOur business is subject to stringent environmental, health and safety regulations which may result in significant liabilities and/or costs to maintain compliance.\nOur operations and properties are subject to extensive and varied federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to public health, the environment, pollution, and occupational safety and health. We have used, and currently use and manufacture, substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under worker safety and health laws and regulations. We take measures to control or eliminate the continuing risk associated with the environmental, health and safety issues, however we could incur substantial fines and civil or criminal sanctions, cleanup costs, compliance investments and third-party property or injury claims as a result of violations, or non-compliance related to these regulations affecting our facilities and operations.\nWe are dependent on the availability and price of raw materials and operating supplies.\nWe purchase carbon and stainless scrap metal and alloy additives, principally nickel, chrome, vanadium, molybdenum, manganese and copper, for our melting operation. A portion of the alloy additives is available only from foreign sources, some of which are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. Those conditions might disrupt supplies or affect the prices of the raw materials. We maintain sales price surcharges on our products to help offset the impact of raw material price fluctuations.\nWe do not maintain long-term fixed-price supply agreements with any of our raw material suppliers. If our supply of raw materials were interrupted, we might not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or obtain sufficient quantities !significant volatility in the price of our principal raw materials could adversely affect our financial results and there can be no assurance that the raw material surcharge mechanism employed by us will completely offset immediate changes in our raw material costs in a given period.\nOur production processes also require consumable operating supplies. Significant volatility in the price of our consumable operating supplies could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business requires substantial amounts of energy.\nThe manufacturing of specialty steel is an energy-intensive process and requires the ready availability of substantial amounts of electricity and natural gas, for which we negotiate competitive supply agreements. While we believe that our energy agreements allow us to compete effectively within the specialty steel industry, the potential for increased costs exists during periods of high demand or supply disruptions. We have a sales price surcharge to help offset the cost fluctuations.\nOur business may be harmed by failures on critical manufacturing equipment.\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon certain critical pieces of specialty steel making equipment, including our 50-ton electric-arc furnace and AOD vessel, our ESR, VIM and VAR furnaces, our radial hydraulic forge and our universal rolling mill. In the event a critical piece of equipment should become inoperative as a result of unexpected equipment failure, there can be no assurance that our operations would not be substantially curtailed, which may have a negative effect on our financial results.\nOur business subjects us to risk of litigation claims, as a routine matter, and this risk increases the potential for a loss that might not be covered by insurance.\nLitigation claims may relate to the conduct of our business, including claims relating to product liability, commercial disputes, employment actions, employee benefits, compliance with domestic and federal laws and personal injury. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we might not prevail on claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face, and additional claims may be made against us in the future. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to us. The resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to manage and support a variety of business activities, including procurement and supply chain, engineering support, and manufacturing. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to the inability to continue to receive software updates and contractual vendor support, damage, disruptions or shutdown due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunications failures, user errors or catastrophic events. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosures of confidential information. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our manufacturing process could be disrupted resulting in late deliveries or even no deliveries if there is a total shutdown.", "PERMNO": 81184, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "USAP"}
