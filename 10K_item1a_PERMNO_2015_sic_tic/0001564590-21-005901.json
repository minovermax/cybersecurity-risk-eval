We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nOur business has incurred significant losses and we may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve profitability and these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern absent obtaining adequate new debt or equity financings.\n\u2022\nWe will need to raise additional funding to advance our product candidates, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness and we may not be entitled to forgiveness of our Paycheck Protection Program Loan, which could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022\nWe have no history of commercializing drugs prior to ANJESO and our success depends heavily on the successful commercialization of ANJESO. To the extent ANJESO is not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed.\n\u2022\nANJESO may cause adverse events or other safety concerns or have other properties that could limit the scope of market acceptance.\n\u2022\nEven with regulatory approval for ANJESO, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and ANJESO may face future regulatory difficulties.\n\u2022\nIf third-party service providers, including carriers, logistics providers and distributors fail to devote sufficient time and resources to ANJESO or their performance is substandard, our successful commercialization may be delayed, and our costs may be higher than expected.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to produce preclinical and clinical supplies, and, if approved, intend to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies, of our product candidates.\n\u2022\nWe may never obtain approval for or commercialize ANJESO outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize its full market potential, and if we receive such approval outside the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to intense competition and, if we are unable to compete effectively, ANJESO may not reach its commercial potential.\n\u2022\nIf third-party payers do not reimburse physicians or patients for ANJESO or if reimbursement levels are, or pricing pressures cause the sales price to be, set too low for us to sell ANJESO at a profit, our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO and our results of operations will be harmed.\n\u2022\nIf we participate in but fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional pricing pressures and controls, reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\u2022\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to litigation or government investigations for a variety of claims, which could adversely affect our operating results, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\n\u2022\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain and have the full attention of our key executives as well as to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel.\n\u2022\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\n\u2022\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised and if we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions, private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\n\u2022\nWe own or license numerous pending patent applications and issued patents in the United States. If our pending patent applications fail to issue or if our issued patents are not sufficiently broad, expire or are successfully opposed, invalidated, or rendered unenforceable, our business will be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future.\nRisk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see pages 3 and 4 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following\nrisks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. All references and risks related to the launch, commercialization or sale of ANJESO or any of our product candidates are predicated on such product candidates receiving the requisite marketing and regulatory approval in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nOur business has incurred significant losses and we may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve profitability.\nOur business has incurred operating losses due to costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities, general and administrative expenses, and commercialization expenses associated with our operations. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $76.1 million and $32.6 million, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we continue to pursue full commercialization of ANJESO, expand our research and development activities and advance our clinical programs for our product candidates. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues. Our ability to generate future revenues depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022\ncommercializing ANJESO;\n\u2022\nmaintaining a sufficient commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for ANJESO or an acquired or in-licensed new product\n\u2022\nmaintaining a commercially viable price for ANJESO;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing commercial quantities of ANJESO at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022\neffectively managing the levels of production, distribution and delivery of ANJESO through our supply chain and adequately adjusting such production and delivery to correspond to market demand;\n\u2022\nobtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-parties, including government payers;\n\u2022\nidentifying and completing the acquisition or in-licensing of other commercial or near-commercial products;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates; and\n\u2022\ncompleting the clinical development of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, and when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf ANJESO is not successfully commercialized, if any of our product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenues are insufficient following commercialization of ANJESO or any of our product candidates, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Our revenues from ANJESO are also dependent upon the size of the markets outside of the United States, as well as our ability to obtain market approval for ANJESO and achieve commercial success outside of the United States on our own or with a collaboration partner. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses from operations for the foreseeable future. Even though we have generated revenues from sales of ANJESO, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nOur losses, negative cash flows from operations and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern absent obtaining adequate new debt or equity financings.\nManagement has concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $112.3 million, cash and cash equivalents of $30.3 million and current liabilities of $18.1 million. Based on available resources, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, consisting of funds raised by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 are sufficient to fund our currently anticipated operating and capital requirements through the first half of 2021, however, our current capital resources are not sufficient to support our planned operations for the next 12 months from the date of the financial statements included in this report.\nWe did not become a revenue-generating company until the second quarter of 2020, following the commercial launch of ANJESO. We expect our expenses relating to the commercialization of ANJESO, including those related to personnel, marketing and selling, to increase. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to commercialize ANJESO and develop our other current and future product candidates. We have also incurred significant indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding balance under our PPP Loan of approximately $1.5 million, of which we cannot assure forgiveness in whole or in part, and an outstanding balance of $10 million under our credit facility with MAM Eagle Lender. These factors, individually and collectively, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and therefore, could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through an issuance of debt or equity securities or otherwise.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. If such additional financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available in sufficient amounts, or we do not have sufficient authorized shares, we may be required to delay, limit or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations.\nThe report of our independent registered accounting firm on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 contain an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe auditor\u2019s opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that we have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows and have an accumulated deficit of $112.3 million as of December 31, 2020 that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While we believe that we will be able to raise the capital we need to continue our operations, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts or will be able to resolve our liquidity issues or eliminate our operating losses. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we would need to significantly reduce our operating plans and curtail some or all our commercialization efforts for ANJESO. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe have used almost all of our unreserved, authorized shares of common stock.\nWe have used almost all of our unreserved authorized shares of common stock and will need shareholder approval to implement an increase in our authorized shares of common stock or a reverse stock split if we intend to issue unreserved shares of common stock in the future. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law currently require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock to approve an increase in our authorized shares of common stock or a reverse stock split. There are no assurances that shareholder approval will be obtained, in which event we will be unable to raise additional capital through the issuance of shares of common stock to fund our future operations.\nWe will need to raise additional funding to advance our product candidates, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $30.3 million.\nDeveloping and commercializing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and ramping up commercialization and manufacturing activities, is expensive. We anticipate incurring significant costs of sales and general and commercialization expenses in connection with the continued commercialization of ANJESO. In addition, we will need to raise additional funds to support our future product development operations. Such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe will need to raise additional funding to continue our commercialization of ANJESO and to satisfy the milestone payments due to Alkermes related to the FDA approval and commercialization of ANJESO. We may also require additional funding to finance the acquisition or in-license of new product candidates. In addition, changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. For example, our commercialization activities for ANJESO may lead to additional, unexpected costs related to the commercial manufacture of ANJESO or the build-out of our commercial sales organization. We may also encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expect for our product candidates. Additional funding will also be needed to develop our product candidates.\nRaising funds in the current economic environment may present substantial challenges, and future financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on reasonable terms, we may curtail, delay or discontinue our research or development programs, scale back or cease any commercialization efforts or wind down our business. In addition, such additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may impede our ability to commercialize ANJESO or our product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding balance under our PPP Loan of approximately $1.5 million and an outstanding balance of $10 million under our credit agreement with MAM Eagle Lender. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it:\n\u2022\nincreases our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nreduces proceeds we may receive as a result of any sale;\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing in the future for working capital, clinical trials, research and development, or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nplaces us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nAny of the above-listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our credit agreement with MAM Eagle Lender also contains certain financial and other covenants, including a minimum liquidity requirement of $5 million at all times, and includes limitations on, among other things, additional indebtedness, paying dividends in certain circumstances, and making certain acquisitions and investments. The credit agreement provides for certain mandatory prepayment events, including with respect to the net proceeds of asset sales, extraordinary receipts, casualty payments and other specified events, based on the terms of the credit agreement with MAM Eagle Lender. Any failure to comply with the terms, covenants and conditions of the credit agreement may limit our ability to draw upon additional tranches of term loans and may result in an event of default under such agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our recently received Paycheck Protection Program Loan, and our application for the Paycheck Protection Program Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible or could result in damage to our reputation.\nOn May 8, 2020, we received loan proceeds of approximately $1.5 million pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act, administered by the Small Business Administration, or SBA. We used the PPP money on permitted purposes under the CARES Act and related regulations, including but not limited to retaining current employees, maintaining payroll and making lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan is evidenced by a promissory note, dated as of May 8, 2020, issued by PNC Bank, National Association, which contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults and breaches of representations and warranties. The PPP Loan is scheduled to mature on May 8, 2022, or the Maturity Date, bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, and is subject to the standard terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act.\nCommencing December 15, 2020, we were required to pay regular monthly payments in an amount equal to one month\u2019s accrued interest under the PPP Loan. All interest which accrues during the initial six months of the loan period will be deferred and payable on the Maturity Date. The amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan may be prepaid by us at any time prior to maturity without penalty. Under the CARES Act, as amended in June 2020, loan forgiveness is generally available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the 8-week period beginning on the date of the first disbursement of the PPP Loan. The amount of the PPP Loan eligible to be forgiven may be reduced in certain circumstances, including as a result of certain headcount or salary reductions. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness, that we will apply for forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA.\nIn order to apply for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, the maintenance of our workforce, our need for additional funding to continue operations, and our ability to access alternative forms of capital in the current market environment in light of the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this analysis, we believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the CARES Act. The certification described above did not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation.\nOn April 23, 2020, the SBA issued new guidance that raised the possibility that certain public companies with substantial market value and access to capital markets would not be able to make this certification in good faith. That SBA guidance further indicated that borrowers \u201cmust make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business.\u201d After being made aware of this new guidance, we conducted additional analysis and determined that we still satisfied the eligibility criteria and had made the certification in good faith. Once again, though, this guidance did not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation.\nUnder PPP, all or a portion of the PPP Loan is eligible for forgiveness if we were eligible for the PPP Loan, use the loan proceeds for eligible expenses and otherwise satisfy PPP requirements. While we believe we are eligible for the PPP Loan, in the event it was determined that we were not eligible for the PPP Loan, it is possible we would be required to repay the PPP Loan on an accelerated basis, rather than over two years provided under the PPP Loan, and at a higher interest rate than 1.000% per annum. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse finding in such audit, some or all of the PPP Loan might not be forgiven and we could be required to return or repay some or all of the PPP Loan, together with interest on the loan, which could reduce our liquidity, and potentially subject us to fines and penalties.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price have and may continue to be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the international outbreak of COVID-19. In December 2019, COVID-19, was identified in China and has since spread to multiple countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has had a broad adverse impact on the global economy across many industries and has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business shutdowns, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Our business performance was significantly impacted by COVID-19 during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, and we continue to expect to see challenges while the pandemic persists and potentially thereafter. The economic impact of the COVID-19 virus, which has caused a broad impact globally, has materially and adversely impacted our business and may continue to adversely affect us. In particular, hospitals in certain geographical regions have reduced and diverted staffing, diverted resources to patients suffering from the infectious disease and limited hospital access for non-patients, including our sales professionals. In addition, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 have impacted our sales professionals\u2019 ability to travel to hospitals. These circumstances have negatively impacted the ability of our sales professionals to effectively market to hospital pharmacists and formulary committees, which has impacted our commercial launch of ANJESO. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the number or patients suffering from post-surgical pain, as hospitals cancel elective surgeries and patients postpone these procedures due to COVID-19 concerns, which may reduce demand for ANJESO and negatively impact our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO. As a result of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization efforts, in November 2020 we implemented a restructuring initiative, which included a reduction of workforce of approximately 40 positions.\nCOVID-19 has and will continue to have an impact on ports and trade globally. We currently rely on Alkermes and Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon, for supply of ANJESO from locations in Ireland and Italy. There is a risk that supplies of ANJESO may be significantly delayed or may become unavailable as a result of COVID-19 and the resulting impact on Alkermes\u2019 and Patheon\u2019s labor force and operations, including as a result of governmental restrictions on business operations and the movement of people and goods in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus. There can be no assurance that we would be able to timely implement any mitigation plans. Disruptions in our supply chain, whether as a result of restricted travel, quarantine requirements or otherwise, could negatively impact our ability to supply and sell ANJESO.\nWhile the potential long-term economic impact of the COVID-19 virus may be difficult to assess or predict, COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital, thereby negatively affecting our liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Given the rapid and evolving nature of the COVID-19 virus, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nRaising additional capital may dilute our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or cause us to relinquish valuable rights.\nWe may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financings. The terms of any financing may harm existing shareholders, and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations, and we may agree to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights that could impede our ability to conduct our business.\nWe may also seek funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, and such agreements may involve relinquishing rights to our product candidates or technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or products candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Such arrangements will limit our participation in the success of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of ANJESO\nOur success depends heavily on the successful commercialization of ANJESO. To the extent ANJESO is not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed, and the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe have invested and continue to invest a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development, approval and now commercialization of ANJESO. Our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to create sufficient capital (through debt, equity or both) to fund commercial operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to consistently manufacture commercial quantities of ANJESO at a reasonable cost and with sufficient speed to meet commercial demand, which may be higher or lower than expected demand on which our manufacturing forecasts have been based;\n\u2022\nour ability to build and maintain a sales and marketing organization to market ANJESO;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify a strategic partner with appropriate sales and marketing capabilities and to enter into a strategic partnership on commercially acceptable terms with such partner to commercialize ANJESO outside the United States;\n\u2022\nour success in educating physicians, patients and caregivers about the benefits, administration and use of ANJESO;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively compete with other medications for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain in medically supervised settings, including IV-opioids and any subsequently approved products;\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of competing products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully defend any challenges to our intellectual property relating to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to set an acceptable price for ANJESO and to obtain adequate coverage and adequate reimbursement for ANJESO;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain acceptance of ANJESO by physicians, patients and the healthcare community;\n\u2022\nour ability to contract with pharmaceutical wholesalers and specialty distributors on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nour effective use of promotional resources;\n\u2022\nour success in obtaining formulary approvals; and\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile for ANJESO.\nMany of these matters are beyond our control and are subject to other risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully commercialize ANJESO. If we cannot do so or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the price of our common stock may decline.\nThe commercial success of ANJESO will depend upon the acceptance of ANJESO by the medical community, including physicians, patients, pharmacy and therapeutics committees, health care payers and hospital formularies.\nPhysicians may not prescribe a sufficient amount of ANJESO, in which case we would not generate the revenues we anticipate. The degree of market acceptance of ANJESO will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payers;\n\u2022\nthe use of ANJESO for the management of moderate-to-severe pain in the hospital setting for patient types that were not specifically studied in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy and the prevalence and severity of any AEs or SAEs;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved label for ANJESO;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments and perceived advantages of ANJESO over such alternative treatments;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain formulary approvals; and\n\u2022\nconsolidation among healthcare providers, which increases the impact of the loss of any relationship;\nIf ANJESO does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, pharmacy and therapeutics committees, health care payers and hospital formularies, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not become profitable.\nANJESO may cause adverse events or other safety concerns or have other properties that could limit the scope of market acceptance.\nAEs caused by ANJESO could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies. Clinical studies conducted with ANJESO have generated some AEs, and in some cases SAEs, as those terms are defined by the FDA in its regulations. During the Study REC-15-015 trial for ANJESO, four treatment-related SAEs were observed in one ANJESO-treated patient and three placebo-treated patients. During the Safety Study, two SAEs occurred in a single placebo-treated patient. It was subsequently determined that none of the SAEs from the Study REC-15-015 trial or the Safety Study were attributable to ANJESO. Additional AEs or SAEs could be generated during future clinical trials. Our commercialization of ANJESO could be adversely impacted by these AEs, SAEs or other safety concerns.\nFurther, even though ANJESO has already received regulatory approval in the United States, if it is shown to cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of ANJESO or impose restrictions on its distribution;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way ANJESO is administered or conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and/or\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of ANJESO and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing ANJESO, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven with regulatory approval for ANJESO, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and ANJESO may face future regulatory difficulties.\nEven with regulatory approval in the United States or if approved in other countries, the FDA and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of ANJESO or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-marketing surveillance. ANJESO is subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-marketing information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nThe applicable regulations in countries outside the United States grant similar powers to the competent authorities and impose similar obligations on companies. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of substantial user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, for compliance with cGMP regulations and adherence to commitments made in the NDA or the application for marketing authorization. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with ANJESO, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to ANJESO or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing, or other FDA action or other action by the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of ANJESO, a regulatory authority may:\n\u2022\nissue a warning letter, untitled letter or Form 483 asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend, modify or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending supplements to an NDA submitted by us;\n\u2022\nseize our product candidate; and/or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nIf any of the above were to occur, our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO and achieve profitability could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product costs or delay commercialization of ANJESO.\nAs ANJESO is manufactured and we conduct required stability testing, issues may arise involving product-packaging and third-party equipment malfunctions. These issues may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with commercial scale manufacturing of ANJESO. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up and validation of commercial manufacturing processes. Any issues in ANJESO manufacturing could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to maintain approval for ANJESO.\nIf we fail to supply ANJESO in sufficient quantities and at acceptable quality and pricing levels, we may face delays in the continued commercialization of ANJESO, or be unable to meet market demand, and may lose potential revenues.\nOur ability to supply sufficient quantities of ANJESO is substantially dependent on the performance of third-party manufacturers. We do not own facilities with capabilities for clinical-scale or commercial manufacturing of injectable meloxicam and we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers to manufacture injectable meloxicam. Alkermes is currently our sole supplier of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation and is the only established supplier of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation. We have committed to purchase our current requirements of injectable meloxicam formulation from Alkermes, and we have commissioned dedicated space in Alkermes\u2019 manufacturing facility for the production of bulk injectable meloxicam. Patheon provides sterile fill and finish services, and we have committed to purchase a certain percentage of our annual requirements of sterile fill and finish services from Patheon. Our agreement with Patheon also obligates us to a minimum annual order quantity, which, if higher than the commercial demand for ANJESO, could expose us to increased costs.\nAlthough our supply agreement and manufacturing agreements for ANJESO allow us to qualify and purchase from an alternative supplier or manufacturer in certain circumstances, it would be time-consuming and expensive for us to do so, and there can be no assurance that an alternative supplier could be found on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. The number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary equipment, expertise and governmental licenses to produce ANJESO is limited. If we encounter any issues with our contract manufacturers or choose to engage a new supplier or contract manufacturer for ANJESO, we would need to qualify and obtain FDA approval for another contract manufacturer or supplier as an alternative source, which could be costly and cause significant delays. Such delay could in turn delay the marketing and continued commercialization of ANJESO, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur reliance on a limited number of vendors to manufacture ANJESO exposes us to risks, any of which could delay commercialization of our products, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential revenues. Our contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy our demand for ongoing commercial demand (even after accounting for the increased capacity to be provided by the dedicated space at the Alkermes facility), may experience technical issues that impact quality or compliance with applicable and strictly enforced regulations governing the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, may be affected by natural disasters that interrupt or prevent manufacturing of our products, may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations, may experience shortages of raw materials and may have difficulties finding replacement parts or equipment. In addition, our contract manufacturers could default on their agreement with us to meet our requirements for commercial supplies of ANJESO and/or Alkermes could fail to deliver the dedicated space according to the currently agreed timeline.\nWe and our contract manufacturers must comply with federal, state and foreign regulations, including FDA\u2019s regulations governing cGMP, enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and by similar regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities at any time may implement new standards or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of our products. Our contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the DEA, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with these regulations. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards and our manufacturers may be found to be in noncompliance with certain regulations, which may impact our ability to manufacture our drug product candidates and may impact the regulatory status of our product candidate. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, product seizure or recall, imposition of a consent decree, or withdrawal of product approval, and would limit the availability of ANJESO. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after ANJESO has been produced and distributed also could result in significant consequences, including costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims. In addition, our contract manufacturers could default on their agreement with us to meet our requirements for commercial supplies of ANJESO and/or Alkermes could fail to deliver the dedicated space according to the currently agreed timeline.\nWhile we have scaled up our manufacturing of ANJESO for commercialization, due to the delay in our commercial launch of ANJESO as a result of the two Complete Response Letters, or CRLs, we have launch stock of ANJESO that could be unable to be sold or could be sold but returned by our wholesalers if expired prior to final sale. A significant amount of expired product or returned product could impact the success of our commercialization of ANJESO, and result in additional costs to manufacture additional product.\nIf, as a result of any of these issues, we are unable to supply the required commercial quantities of ANJESO to meet market demand for ANJESO, on a timely basis or at all, we may suffer damage to our reputation and commercial prospects and we will lose potential revenues.\nIf third-party service providers, including carriers, logistics providers and distributors, fail to devote sufficient time and resources to ANJESO or their performance is substandard, our successful commercialization may be delayed, and our costs may be higher than expected.\nOur reliance on third-party service providers, including carriers, logistics providers and distributors, exposes us to risks that could delay or impair the successful commercialization of ANJESO, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues. Our carriers may experience technical issues relating to the timing and shipment of ANJESO, may encounter issues in connection with transporting our products internationally, or may become subject to other transit difficulties that could cause loss or damage to ANJESO, some of which may not be adequately covered under our insurance policies. Our third-party logistic providers may experience difficulty in providing key services relating to customer service, warehousing, inventory management, distribution services, contract management, chargeback processing, accounts receivable management, cash application and financial management. Our distributors could become unable to sell and deliver ANJESO for regulatory, compliance and other reasons. Our carriers, logistics providers, distributors and other third-party service providers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in business for the time required to successfully ship, store, deliver, sell and distribute ANJESO and we may incur additional cost. Any of our vendors could also default on or terminate their agreements with us, which could delay or impair the successful commercialization of ANJESO, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. All of these risks are further exacerbated by COVID-19 and its potential impact on the third-parties on which we rely.\nEven with FDA approval for ANJESO in the United States, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize ANJESO outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize its full market potential.\nIn order to market ANJESO outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding quality, safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non- clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time-consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of ANJESO in those countries. While our management has experience in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals, we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we, as a company, do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in international markets is delayed, our target market will be reduced, and our ability to realize the full market potential of ANJESO will be adversely affected.\nFor example, in the European Union, similar to the United States regulation scheme, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual European Union member states both before and after grant of the manufacturing and Marketing Authorizations. This includes control of compliance with cGMP rules, which govern quality control of the manufacturing process and require documentation policies and procedures. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to ensure that all of our processes, methods, and equipment are compliant with cGMP. Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to comply with European Union laws and the related national laws of individual European Union member states governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, and marketing of such products following grant of authorization may result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays in or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant Marketing Authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing, or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines, and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have no history of commercializing drugs prior to ANJESO, which may make it difficult to predict our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO and our future performance or evaluate our business and prospects.\nOur operations have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking non-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates and we have only obtained regulatory approval for one product, ANJESO. To date, we have a limited time period in demonstrating our ability to successfully manufacture at commercial scale or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales, marketing and distribution activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Because our success is dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO, any predictions about our ability to do so and our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer history of successfully developing and commercializing drugs.\nIf we are unable to identify a strategic partner with appropriate sales and marketing capabilities to sell ANJESO in markets outside of the United States and enter into a strategic partnership on commercially acceptable terms with such partner, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from ANJESO to achieve profitability.\nTo date, we have not entered into any strategic partnerships for ANJESO; however, we may enter into a strategic partnership to commercialize ANJESO outside of the United States. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships. In addition, our future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of ANJESO or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of ANJESO to healthcare professionals in geographic regions that are not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize ANJESO, our ability to generate revenues from ANJESO will be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to intense competition and, if we are unable to compete effectively, ANJESO may not reach its commercial potential.\nThe market for ANJESO is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. ANJESO competes with a number of existing and future pharmaceuticals and drug delivery devices developed, manufactured and marketed by others. We compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.\nIn the post-operative pain relief setting, we believe patients are prescribed injectable acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sodium channel blockers and opioids, depending on the severity of pain. Specifically, acetaminophen, NSAIDs and sodium channel blockers, we believe, are prescribed for mild to moderate pain relief, whereas we believe opioids are prescribed for moderate to severe pain relief. While we compete with all of these compounds in the post-operative pain setting, ANJESO is prescribed for moderate to severe pain, also competing with opioids and other non-opioid pain treatments. There are a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently market and/or manufacture therapeutics in the pain relief area, including Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt plc, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Trevena, Inc. and Innocoll Holdings plc. Mallinckrodt commercializes an injectable formulation of acetaminophen. Pacira commercializes an intraoperative formulation of bupivacaine, a sodium channel blocker. Trevena commercializes an intravenous opioid analgesic. Additionally, companies such as Adynxx, Inc., Durect Corporation, Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Sandoz AG, Avenue Therapeutics, Inc., Neumentum Inc. and Cara Therapeutics, Inc. are currently developing post-operative pain therapeutics that could compete with ANJESO in the future.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may have an advantage in marketing their approved products, which may limit our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours, and our competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. These advantages could materially impact our ability to develop and commercialize ANJESO successfully.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nWe anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and additional technologies become available in the pain management and relief space. Finally, the development of different methods for the treatment of acute pain following surgery could render ANJESO non-competitive or obsolete or decrease its market share for the treatment of acute pain following surgery. These and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations.\nIf we are unable to establish additional relationships with group purchasing organizations any future revenues or future profitability could be materially affected.\nMany end-users of pharmaceutical products have relationships with group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, whereby such GPOs provide such end-users access to a broad range of pharmaceutical products from multiple suppliers at competitive prices and, in certain cases, exercise considerable influence over the drug purchasing decisions of such end-users. Hospitals and other end-users contract with the GPO of their choice for their purchasing needs. We have contracted with GPOs such as Vizient, Inc. and Premier Inc. We expect to derive revenue for sales of ANJESO from end-user customers that are members of GPOs, for ANJESO. Establishing and maintaining strong relationships with these GPOs will require us to be a reliable supplier, remain price competitive and comply with FDA regulations. The GPOs with whom we have relationships may have relationships with manufacturers that sell competing products, and such GPOs may earn higher margins from these products or combinations of competing products or may prefer products other than\nours for other reasons. If we are unable to establish or maintain our GPO relationships, or establish additional GPO relationships, sales of ANJESO related revenues could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement for ANJESO or pricing pressures cause the sales price to be set too low for us to sell ANJESO at a profit, our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO and our results of operations will be harmed.\nOur ability to commercialize ANJESO successfully will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for ANJESO will be available in a timely manner from third-party payers, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations and other pricing limitations such as mandatory rebates or discounts. Reimbursement and pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in ANJESO. Although the CMS established a permanent J-code reimbursement code for ANJESO, which provides hospital outpatient departments, ambulatory surgery centers and physician offices in the United States one consistent Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code to standardize the submission and payment of ANJESO insurance claims, this does not guarantee reimbursement across such plans.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payers depend upon a number of factors, including each third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022\nappropriate and medically necessary for the specific condition or disease;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining and maintaining coverage and reimbursement approval for ANJESO from government authorities or other third-party payers is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, for the use of ANJESO to each government authority or other third-party payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. In addition, acceptance by third-party payers could be negatively impacted by any negative perception third-party payers may have of ANJESO as a result of our receipt of two CRLs received from the FDA for ANJESO, and the resulting labeling, despite subsequent FDA approval.\nThird-party payers may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payers may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Failure to obtain timely hospital formulary approval will limit our commercial success, and obtaining and maintaining such approval can be an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain the formulary approvals to allow us to sell ANJESO into our target markets, nor, if formulary approval is obtained, at what price ANJESO will be accepted for sale and reimbursement.\nIncreasingly, third-party payers are also requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. These third-party payers could also impose price controls restricting the prices at which the products will be reimbursed and other conditions that must be met by patients prior to providing coverage for the use of ANJESO.\nThird-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services, which can impact the demand for, or the price of, such products and services. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Levels of reimbursement may also decrease in the future, due to the availability of numerous generic pain medications available at lower costs or future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payers which may adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement available for ANJESO, which in turn, could negatively impact pricing. If patients are not adequately reimbursed for ANJESO, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of it, which could result in a significant shortfall in achieving revenue expectations, prevent us from achieving profitability and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition.\nMoreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to obtain and maintain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payers for ANJESO could result in a significant shortfall\nin achieving revenue expectations, prevent us from achieving profitability and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize ANJESO outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may enter into agreements with third parties to seek approval for and market ANJESO outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\nlower pricing of products in our market segment or in general; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nThe realization of any of these risks would negatively affect our ability to attain or sustain profitability.\nOur relationships with physicians, patients and payers in the U.S. are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws could expose us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, reputational harm, and could harm our results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur current and future operations with respect to the commercialization of ANJESO are subject to various U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These laws impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, support and education programs and constrain our business and financial arrangements and relationships with third-party payers, healthcare professionals and others who may prescribe, recommend, purchase or provide ANJESO, and other parties through which we will market, sell and distribute ANJESO. Finally, our current and future operations are subject to additional healthcare-related statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws are described in greater detail in the section below under \u201cBusiness Government Regulation - Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements,\u201d and include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through \u201cqui tam,\u201d or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government), prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government;\n\u2022\nHIPAA which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nstate laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to\ncomply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and\n\u2022\nthe Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the preceding calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nThe shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare or pharmaceutical company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations or guidance. In addition, the complex framework of laws and regulations at the federal and state law are subject to change, which could lead to non-compliance or additional costs in updating our compliance mechanism to reflect these changes. For example, several states have enacted laws or regulations affecting or restricting payments that pharmaceutical manufacturers or distributors can make to physicians and other drug prescribers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional oversight and reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to the same criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert resources and the attention of our management from operating our business.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity in addition to the aforementioned potential regulatory actions. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize ANJESO and generate revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are able to successfully commercialize ANJESO and if we participate in but fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional pricing pressures and controls, reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and other governmental pricing programs, we will be obligated to pay certain specified rebates and report pricing information with respect to ANJESO. Pricing and rebate calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by the CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due, and CMS may request or require restatements for earlier periods as well. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B program, and other similar government pricing programs. These programs are described in greater detail in the section titled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Formulary Approvals and Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement.\u201d\nWe will also be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $181,071 per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $13,066\nfor each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $18,107 per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid for ANJESO. A final regulation imposes a civil monetary penalty of up to $5,000 for each instance of knowingly and intentionally charging a 340B covered entity more than the 340B ceiling price.\nFederal law requires that a company must participate in the FSS pricing program to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds. As part of this program, we would be obligated to make ANJESO available for procurement on an FSS contract, under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price to four federal agencies (VA, DoD, Public Health Service, and U.S. Coast Guard). The Federal Ceiling Price is based on the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or Section 703 Agreement, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the U.S. civil False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Affordable Care Act and any changes in healthcare law may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize ANJESO and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could restrict or regulate post-approval activities relating to ANJESO and affect our ability to profitably sell ANJESO. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nThe Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. These intended reforms are described in greater detail in the section below under \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - United States Healthcare Reform.\u201d\nAmong the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that have been implemented since enactment and are of importance to the commercialization of ANJESO are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports specified branded prescription drugs or biologic agents;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the U.S. civil False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nrequirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u2022\na requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nThere have been significant ongoing judicial, administrative, executive and legislative efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. During his Administration, President Trump issued executive orders which sought to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act and modified how it was implemented. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select\nCommittee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThe Affordable Care Act has also been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. A ruling is expected in 2021.\nFurther changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he may use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for ANJESO and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or successfully commercialize ANJESO.\nLegislative or regulatory programs that may influence prices of prescription drugs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO.\nCurrent or future federal or state laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for ANJESO. Programs in existence in certain states seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular, state Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the price we receive for ANJESO and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the pharmaceutical industry has in recent years been the subject of significant publicity regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by pharmaceutical companies for new products as well as price increases by pharmaceutical companies on older products that the public has deemed excessive. Any downward pricing pressure on the price of ANJESO arising from social or political pressure to lower the cost of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, pharmaceutical product prices have been the focus of increased scrutiny by the government, including certain state attorneys general, members of Congress and the United States Department of Justice. Decreases in health care reimbursements or prices of ANJESO could limit our ability to sell ANJESO or decrease our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our manufacturing and supply relationships.\nSome of the contract manufacturers of ANJESO manufacture and source raw materials outside the United States and we may, in the future, use manufacturers outside the United States for our product candidates, including ANJESO. As such, we are subject to risks associated with such international manufacturing relationships, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nproblems related to markets with different cultural biases or political systems;\n\u2022\npossible difficulties in enforcing agreements in multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and shipping lead-times;\n\u2022\nincreased risk relating to the transport of products internationally, including damage to our product, shipment delays relating to the import or export of our products or the delivery of our products by means of additional third-party vendors;\n\u2022\ndifficulties obtaining export or import licenses for our products;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws and regulations governing international trade;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the United States.; and\n\u2022\nimposition of domestic and international customs and tariffs, withholding or other taxes, including any value added taxes.\nAdditionally, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits by governmental authorities responsible for administering import/export regulations. To the extent that we are unable to successfully defend against an audit or review, we may be required to pay assessments, penalties, and increased duties on products imported into the United States.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. It is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not accept our NDA filings;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with the design, scope or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA may change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWe cannot be certain that our product candidates other than ANJESO will receive regulatory approval. Our revenue is dependent, to a significant extent, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we have gained regulatory approval of ANJESO and will be dependent on the size of the market in the territories for which we require regulatory approval of our product candidates. If the markets for patients or indications that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, if approved, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product candidates may cause adverse events or other safety concerns or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAEs caused by our product candidates could cause us, reviewing entities, clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. Clinical studies conducted with our product candidates have generated some AEs, and in some cases SAEs, as those terms are defined by the FDA in its regulations, and AEs or SAEs could be generated during our on-going and future clinical trials. Our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted by these AEs, SAEs or other safety concerns.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development.\nClinical trials are expensive, can take many years to complete and have highly uncertain outcomes. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as a result of inadequate study design, inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols, or other factors. New drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. Some of our pipeline product candidates are in early stages of development, and positive preclinical and Phase I clinical trials for those product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our clinical trials may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. If clinical trials for any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries will not approve that drug and we would not be able to commercialize it, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates, or the time required to complete clinical trials for our product candidates may be longer than anticipated. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching an agreement with the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries on final trial design or the scope of the development program;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new clinical sites; or\n\u2022\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver a sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf clinical trials for any of our product candidates are delayed for any of the above reasons or other reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize our product candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to produce preclinical and clinical supplies, and, if approved, intend to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies, of our product candidates.\nWe do not own facilities for clinical-scale or commercial manufacturing of our product candidates. We rely on third parties to supply the materials for, and manufacture, our research and development, and preclinical and clinical trial APIs. There can be no assurance that our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development drugs and other materials will not be limited, interrupted, restricted in certain geographic regions or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. In particular, any replacement of our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturer could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified manufacturers.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate. To the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner consistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third-party manufacturing for product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully. Our or a third party\u2019s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nan inability to initiate or continue preclinical studies or clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n\u2022\ndelay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for product candidates;\n\u2022\nloss of the cooperation of a collaborator\n\u2022\nsubjecting our product candidates to additional inspections by regulatory authorities; and\n\u2022\nin the event of approval to market and commercialize a product candidate, the withdrawal of such approval and/or an inability to meet commercial demand.\nIn addition, our ability to obtain materials from these suppliers could be disrupted if the operations of these manufacturers are affected by earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. If their facilities are unable to operate because of an accident or incident, even for a short period of time, some or all of our research and development programs may be harmed or delayed, and our operations and financial condition could suffer. Our third-party manufacturers also may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment, and their operations may also produce hazardous waste products. In the event of contamination or injury, our third-party manufacturers could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding their resources, which could result in our clinical trials or regulatory approvals being delayed or suspended. If we encounter any issues with our contract manufacturers or choose to engage a new supplier or contract manufacturer for any of our product candidates for which we seek regulatory approval, we would need to qualify and obtain FDA approval for another contract manufacturer or supplier as an alternative source for these products and services, which could be costly and cause significant delays.\nWe use third parties to assist with conducting, supervising and monitoring portions of our nonclinical and clinical studies, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe use third parties to provide certain manufacturing and operational support and for assistance with clinical trials, data management and statistical support. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over certain of these third parties\u2019 actual performance. We have previously relied upon such third parties and plan to continue to use third parties to assist with monitoring and managing data for our ongoing clinical programs for ANJESO and our product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our third parties\u2019 activities.\nWe and our contractors are required to comply with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries for all of our product candidates in development. The FDA and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries enforce these GLPs and cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our contractors fail to comply with applicable GLPs and cGCPs, the data generated in our nonclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials for our product candidates will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of each product candidate. Accordingly, if our contractors fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat the clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nThese contractors may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. While we take steps to protect our intellectual property, we face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by our contractors, which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology. If our contractors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines for items within their purview, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they oversee is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or successfully commercialize ANJESO or our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for ANJESO and any future product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nWe may be subject to litigation or government investigations for a variety of claims, which could adversely affect our operating results, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe may be subject to litigation or government investigations. These may include claims, lawsuits, and proceedings involving securities laws, fraud and abuse, healthcare compliance, product liability, labor and employment, wage and hour, commercial and other matters. For example, on May 31, 2018, the Securities Litigation was filed against Recro and certain of its officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Case No. 2:18-cv-02279-MMB) and purported to state a claim for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on statements made by Recro concerning the NDA for ANJESO. The second amended complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and other costs. Recro filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on June 18, 2020. The plaintiff filed an opposition to Recro\u2019s motion to\ndismiss on August 17, 2020. On September 16, 2020, Recro filed a reply in support of the motion to dismiss. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d included in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn connection with our November 2019 separation from Recro, we accepted assignment by Recro of all of Recro\u2019s obligations in connection with the Securities Litigation and agreed to indemnify Recro for all liabilities related to the Securities Litigation. Recro and we believe that the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it. At this time, no assessment can be made as to its likely outcome or whether the outcome will be material to us. This litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s resources and attention. In addition, any adverse determination could expose us to significant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIssues with product quality could have a material adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.\nOur success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our product candidates and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our future products, which may result in difficulty in successfully launching product candidates and the loss of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain and have the full attention of our key executives as well as to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive team and, in particular, the services of Gerri A. Henwood, our President and Chief Executive Officer, the loss of whose services would adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Recruiting and retaining qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee could impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe will need to continue to grow the size of our organization. We may experience difficulties in managing this growth and factors outside our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may make it more difficult to operate and maintain a larger organization.\nOnce we received FDA approval of ANJESO, we increased the size of our managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources as we prepared for the commercialization of ANJESO and development of our other product candidates. Our efforts to commercialize ANJESO were severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals reduced elective surgeries, and many have still not yet returned to their prior number of surgeries before the COVID-19 outbreak, which has caused, and likely will continue to result in a decreased demand for ANJESO. COVID-19 also impacted revenue for hospitals, reduced staffing, diverted resources from other normal activities to patients suffering from COVID-19 and limited hospital access for nonpatients, including our sales professionals, which we believe has impacting our marketing and commercialization efforts. As a result of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization efforts, in November 2020 we implemented a restructuring initiative, which included a reduction of workforce of approximately 40 positions.\nIf ANJESO is successfully commercialized, we intend to expand our employee base to fully support our evolution as a commercial stage pharmaceutical company. We will need to increase and maintain a specialty sales force to promote ANJESO to healthcare professionals and third-party payers. As we continue to expand, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Additional future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our existing or future product candidates. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nmanaging the commercialization of any FDA approved product candidates;\n\u2022\noverseeing our ongoing clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees, including any additional sales and marketing personnel engaged in connection with the commercialization of any approved product, on terms that are favorable to us if at all;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and financial systems and procedures; and\n\u2022\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaboration partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. At this time, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage such growth amid the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies, that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nA key aspect of our business strategy is seeking in-license or acquisition opportunities to add commercial or near-commercial products to our portfolio. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or shares of our common or preferred stock as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our shareholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nOur employees, partners, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and contract research organizations may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, partners, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and CROs may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity with respect to our business. Misconduct by these employees could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: (1) FDA or DEA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (2) manufacturing standards; (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any incidents or any other conduct that leads to an employee receiving an FDA debarment could result in a loss of business from our partners and severe reputational harm. We have adopted adopt a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face potential product liability claims, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nCommercial sales of ANJESO expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Additionally, the use of any of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any future products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of these claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation and negative media attention;\n\u2022\ninability to commercialize ANJESO or any future product candidates subject to product liability claims;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical study participants or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our manufacturing services or loss of any of our commercial partners;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for ANJESO or any future approved products subject to product liability claims;\n\u2022\nincreased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, State Attorneys General, members of Congress and the public.\nOur current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments are excluded from our insurance coverage or exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon our management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\nWe are a public company and, as such, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act and we incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including certain of the requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as other rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq, the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. If we fail to comply with current corporate governance requirements, our business may be negatively affected, including by having our common stock delisted from Nasdaq.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically in recent years. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are unable to currently estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect that these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to continue to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and if we are able to maintain such insurance, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage available to privately-held companies. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors, or the board, or as our executive officers.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations and reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act. In addition, we qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will be exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires auditor attestation to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. We will cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total gross annual revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2024; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs of the expiration of our emerging growth company status, we will be broadly subject to enhanced reporting and other requirements under the Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This will require, among other things, annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm\naddressing these assessments. These and other obligations could place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources and our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Under the Exchange Act, a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company\u2019s internal controls. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that address privacy and data security of patients who use our product candidates in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Numerous federal, state and international laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information in the United States. These laws impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of personal information, including individually identifiable health information, and impose notification obligations in the event of a breach of the privacy or security of personal information. Failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign data protection laws and compliance requirements. For example, in the European Union, the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Switzerland and the United Kingdom have adopted similar restrictions. Data protection authorities from different European countries may interpret the applicable laws differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in Europe. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These proceedings or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe own or license numerous pending patent applications and issued patents in the United States. If our pending patent applications fail to issue or if our issued patents are not sufficiently broad, expire or are successfully opposed, invalidated, or rendered unenforceable, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, as well as successfully defending our current and future patents against third-party challenges. To protect our proprietary technology, we intend to rely on patents, and we may also rely on other intellectual property protections, including trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality provisions.\nThere can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. We own patents and patent applications for injectable meloxicam that cover pharmaceutical compositions, including compositions produced using NanoCrystal\u00ae technology, methods of making ANJESO and methods of treating pain with ANJESO. These issued patents expire between 2022 and 2030 in the United States. We also exclusively in-license from Alkermes to manufacture and commercialize IV, intramuscular and parenteral meloxicam, on a perpetual royalty-free basis, patents and applications that are directed to methods of reducing flake-like aggregates in injectable nanoparticulate active agent compositions, and directed to injectable nanoparticulate active agent compositions produced by methods for reducing flake-like aggregates, which begin to expire in 2030, and an application directed to injectable, nanoparticulate meloxicam compositions containing flake-like aggregation reducing agents, which, if issued, would expire in 2030 in the field of manufacturing and commercializing IV, intramuscular and parenteral meloxicam. As of February 1, 2021, we own nine issued U.S. patents and four U.S. pending patent applications, and 58 issued foreign patents (including European validation countries) and fifteen pending PCT or foreign applications related to meloxicam, ANJESO, formulations of meloxicam, and methods of using meloxicam, which expire or would expire (if issued) between 2022 and 2039. As of February 1, 2021, we exclusively license eight issued U.S. patents and one U.S. pending patent application, and 40 issued foreign patents (including European validation countries) and two pending foreign applications relating to ANJESO, formulations of meloxicam and methods of manufacturing meloxicam to manufacture and commercialize ANJESO, intramuscular meloxicam and parenteral meloxicam. February 1, 2021, we own four issued U.S. patents, 20 issued foreign patents, including European validation countries, and one pending foreign application to Dex. In addition, we have licensed four patent families containing several U.S. and foreign issued patents and one pending application related to neuromuscular blocking agents from Cornell University. The patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents or the inventorship thereof, which can lead to an issued patent being found invalid, unenforceable or can otherwise alter the ownership of the patents.\nThe issuance of any patent is not a certainty. Unless and until our pending applications issue, their protective scope is impossible to determine. It is impossible to predict whether or how many of these applications will result in issued patents and patents that issue may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of patent exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which may limit our ability to prevent others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In addition, upon expiration of a patent, we may be limited in our ability to prevent others from using or commercializing subject matter covered by the expired patents. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us, generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the first filing, or in some cases at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. In addition, we may not be aware of particular prior art publications that may have an impact on patentability or enforceability. Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications due to, for example, such prior art publications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Furthermore, our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, and/or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Changes in either the patent laws\nor interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of patents or narrow the scope of patent protection.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. The Leahy Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy Smith Act, enacted in September 2011, brought significant changes to the U.S. patent system. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office continues to develop and implement new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy Smith Act became effective on March 16, 2013. The Leahy Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patent, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nGeneric competitors can challenge the U.S. patents protecting our product candidates by filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a generic or a modified version of our product candidates and negatively affect our competitive position.\nSeparate and apart from the protection provided under the U.S. patent laws, drug candidates may be subject to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which may provide drug candidates with either a three- or five-year period of marketing exclusivity following receipt of FDA approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the FDA from accepting the filing of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, (for a generic product) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (for a modified version of the product) for three years for active drug ingredients previously approved by the FDA or for five years for active drug ingredients not previously approved by the FDA.\nThere is an exception, however, for newly approved molecules that allows competitors to challenge a patent beginning four years into the five-year exclusivity period by alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the FDA\u2019s list of approved drug products are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed and submitting an ANDA for a generic version of a drug candidate. This patent challenge is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. If we have an Orange Book listed patent and a third party submits a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the Paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third party\u2019s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice and we will be entitled to a 30 month stay running from the end of the 5-year new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity period. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third party\u2019s ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay and the FDA could approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application after expiration of any applicable marketing exclusivity, such as the 5-year NCE exclusivity period or 3-year clinical investigation exclusivity. Within the past several years, the generic industry has aggressively pursued approvals of generic versions of innovator drugs at the earliest possible point in time.\nIf a generic company is able to successfully challenge the patents covering drug candidates or design around our patents and obtain FDA approval for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, the generic company may choose to launch a generic or modified version of our drug candidate. Any launch of a generic or modified version of our drug candidates prior to the expiration of patent protection will have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock or cause it to continue to be highly volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize ANJESO;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify a strategic partner with appropriate sales and marketing capabilities and to enter into a strategic partnership on commercially acceptable terms with such partner to commercialize ANJESO outside the United States;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage the levels of production, distribution and delivery of ANJESO through our supply chain;\n\u2022\nour ability to leverage our development experience to progress our other pipeline product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and successfully acquire or in-license new product candidates on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nFDA, state or international regulatory actions, including actions on regulatory applications for ANJESO or any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022\njudicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nlitigation or public concern about the safety of our products or product candidates or similar products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;\n\u2022\nour announcement of financing transactions, including debt, convertible notes, warrant exchanges, etc.;\n\u2022\nour ability to have sufficient authorized shares of our common stock available;\n\u2022\nthe ability to effectuate a reverse stock split or other similar change to our capital structure;\n\u2022\nthe continued negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy; and\n\u2022\nactions by institutional shareholders.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including recently. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our operations. Our ability to pay cash dividends is currently restricted by the terms of our credit facility with MAM Eagle Lender. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Pennsylvania law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprovide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer or president;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals to be brought before a shareholder meeting and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of director;\n\u2022\nprovide that certain provisions of the amended and restated articles of incorporation may only be amended with the affirmative vote of 662/3% of the holders of the outstanding shares of capital stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that shareholders may only act at a duly organized meeting; and\n\u2022\nprovide that members of our board of directors may be removed from office by our shareholders only for cause by the affirmative vote of 75% of the total voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Pennsylvania, we are governed by the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, or PBCL, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. Under Pennsylvania law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 20% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for five years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Pennsylvania law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation will designate the state and federal courts located within the County of Philadelphia in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state or federal court located within the County of Philadelphia in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of PBCL, or (iv) any action asserting a claim peculiar to the relationships among or between our company and our officers, directors and shareholders. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for the types of claims listed above, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised in the event of system failures, unauthorized access, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nWe rely extensively on information technology and systems including internet sites, data hosting, physical security, and software applications and platforms. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, power outages, user errors or catastrophic events. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems, by our employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact or interrupt operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. The use of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems or our third-party systems. We could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyberattacks, which may compromise our systems or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers.\nAs part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on patients and our employees. Breaches in security, either internally or at our third-party providers, could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, interruption to our operations, damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we maintain information security policies and systems designed to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur.\nAny such business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyberattacks, or violation of personal information laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLitigation involving patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time-consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing our product candidates to market and interfere with our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.\nIn a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents and/or our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a low burden of proof.\nIf we were found by a court to have infringed a valid third-party patent claim, we could be prevented from using the patented technology or be required to pay the owner of the patent for the right to license the patented technology or other compensatory damages. If we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights. For example, if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor, that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us. If we decide to develop alternative technology, we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products.\nIt is possible that we may in the future receive, particularly as a public company, communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation. In addition to patent infringement claims, third parties may assert copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights against us. We may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be able to be successful in our defense. Our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged in the United States to date. The pharmaceutical patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties. Further, if any patent license we obtain is deemed invalid and/or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nwe were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nan individual or party will not challenge inventorship, that if successful, could have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may possess, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn the future, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects on our competitive business position.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications.\nWe have systems in place to remind us to pay periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other patent and application fees, and we employ an outside law firm to pay these fees. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ an outside law firm and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are\nsituations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property. If we are unable to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to initiate or maintain coverage of our stock, publish a negative report or change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If securities or industry analysts fail to initiate coverage of our stock, the lack of exposure to the market could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If any of the analysts who cover us or may cover us in the future publish a negative report or change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us or may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur shareholders may experience dilution in the future.\nIn the future, our shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in the company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we plan to grant to our directors, officers and employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we expect to issue stock options or other share-based awards to employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation will authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 19034, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BXRX"}
