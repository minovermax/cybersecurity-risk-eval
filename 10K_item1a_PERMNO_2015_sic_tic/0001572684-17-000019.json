RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. You should carefully consider the following risks and the other matters in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to achieve our objectives, which in turn could cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment. Some statements in this report, including statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note about Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur long-term growth depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully identify and acquire desirable land parcels for residential buildout, which may be limited due to a variety of factors.\nOur future growth depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully identify and acquire attractive land parcels in geographic areas in which we operate for development of single-family homes at reasonable prices, either by ourselves, through Benchmark Communities, or by our third-party homebuilder customers. Our ability to acquire land parcels for new single-family homes may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land parcels at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning and other market conditions. If the supply of land parcels appropriate for development of single-family homes is limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, our ability to grow could be significantly limited, and our revenue and gross margin could decline. To the extent that we are unable to purchase land parcels or enter into new contracts or options for the purchase of land parcels at reasonable prices, our revenue and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur industry is cyclical and adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for homes and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as levels of employment, consumer sentiment and income, availability and cost of financing for acquisitions, construction and mortgages, interest rate levels, inflation and demand for housing. The health of the residential homebuilding industry may also be significantly affected by \u201cshadow inventory\u201d levels during recessionary and recovery periods.\n\u201cShadow inventory\u201d refers to the number of homes with mortgages that are in some form of distress but that have not yet been listed for sale. Shadow inventory can occur when lenders put properties that have been foreclosed or forfeited to lenders or available for short sale (i.e. potentially available for sale for an amount that is less than the unpaid principal balance on a related mortgage loan) on the market gradually, rather than all at once, or delay the foreclosure process. A significant shadow inventory in our markets could, were it to be released, adversely impact home and land prices and demand for our homes and land, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an important segment of our end-purchaser and customer base consists of first-time and second-time \u201cmove-up\u201d buyers, the latter often purchase homes subject to contingencies related to the sale of their existing homes. The difficulties facing these buyers in selling their homes during recessionary periods may adversely affect our sales. Moreover, during such periods, we may need to reduce our sales prices and offer greater incentives to buyers to compete for sales, and that may result in reduced gross margins.\nOur long-term growth depends, in part, upon our ability to acquire undeveloped land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices.\nThe availability of partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase at reasonable prices depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, the ability to obtain building permits and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact us. As competition for suitable land increases, the cost of acquiring partially finished developed lots and undeveloped lots and the cost of developing owned land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact us. The availability of suitable land assets could also affect the success of our land acquisition strategy, which may impact our ability to increase the number of actively selling communities, grow our revenue and gross margins, and achieve or maintain profitability. Additionally, developing undeveloped land\nis capital intensive and time consuming. It is possible that we may develop land based upon forecasts and assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, resulting in projects that are not economically viable.\nBecause of the seasonal nature of our business our quarterly operating results fluctuate.\nWe generally experience seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements that can have a material impact on our results and our consolidated financial statements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, the timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes four to six months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry. In a recovering housing market, we expect the traditional seasonality and its impact on our results of operations would become more pronounced. This seasonality requires us to finance our construction activities significantly in advance of the receipt of sales proceeds. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will invest significant amounts of capital in the acquisition and development of land and construction of homes that we do not sell at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames. If, due to market conditions, construction delays or other causes we do not complete home sales at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf the market value of our land inventory decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs.\nThe market value of our land and housing inventories depends on market conditions. We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets. There is a risk that the value of the land owned by us may decline after purchase. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. In addition, our deposits for lots controlled under purchase, option or similar contracts may be put at risk.\nFactors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation and planning), political conditions, the condition of financial markets, both local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject land valuations to uncertainty. Moreover, our valuations are made on the basis of assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic conditions and demographics that may prove to be inaccurate. If housing demand fails to meet our expectations when we acquired our inventory, our profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell homes that we build or land that we own.\nWe regularly review the value of our land holdings and continue to review our holdings on a periodic basis. Material write-downs and impairments in the value of our inventory may be required, and we may in the future sell land or homes at a loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 9, \"Fair Value Disclosures\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairment and estimated fair values of real estate inventories included elsewhere in this report.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive, and if our competitors are more successful or offer better value to our customers our business could decline.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders and land developers in each of the markets in which we operate. Additionally, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business and new competitors arise from time to time. We compete with numerous large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders and land developers for, among other things, home buyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. Our competitors may develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products, which could make our products less attractive to consumers.\nWe may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to certain of our large national and regional homebuilding competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours, as these competitors may be better able to withstand any future regional downturn in the housing market. Many of these competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial and operational resources than we do. Additionally, many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors\nand suppliers in the markets in which we operate. This may give our competitors an advantage in marketing their products, securing materials and labor at lower prices and allowing their homes to be delivered to customers more quickly and at more favorable prices. This competition could reduce our market share and limit our ability to expand our business.\nIncreased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, adversely affect our market share and cause us to increase our selling incentives and reduce our prices. An oversupply of homes available for sale or discounting of home prices could adversely affect pricing for homes in the markets in which we operate. Oversupply and price discounting can be exacerbated by supply from the resale, or \u201cpreviously owned,\u201d home market, with which we also compete. Oversupply and price discounting have periodically adversely affected certain markets, and it is possible that our markets will be adversely affected by these factors in the future. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf home buyers are not able to obtain suitable mortgage financing, due to more stringent lending standards, rising interest rates, changes in regulation, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities, changes in the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the federal government or other reasons, our results of operations may decline.\nA majority of home buyers finance their home purchases through lenders that provide mortgage financing. The availability of mortgage financing may be constrained, due in part to lower mortgage valuations on properties, various regulatory changes and lower risk appetite by lenders, with many lenders requiring increased levels of financial qualification, lending at lower multiples of income and requiring larger down payments. First-time home buyers are generally more affected by the availability of mortgage financing than other potential home buyers. These buyers are a key source of demand for new homes. A limited availability of home mortgage financing may adversely affect the volume of our home and land sales and the sales prices we achieve.\nAdditionally, housing demand is adversely affected by reduced availability of mortgage financing and factors that increase the upfront or monthly cost of financing a home, such as increases in interest rates, insurance premiums or limitations on mortgage interest deductibility. Any decrease in the willingness and ability of lenders to make home mortgage loans, the tightening of lending standards and the reduction in the types of financing products available, will make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain acceptable financing. Any substantial increase in mortgage interest rates or unavailability of mortgage financing may adversely affect the ability of prospective first-time and move-up home buyers to obtain financing for our homes, as well as adversely affect the ability of prospective move-up home buyers to sell their current homes. The housing industry is benefiting from the current low interest rate environment, which has allowed many home buyers to obtain mortgage financing with relatively low interest rates as compared to long-term historical averages. While the timing of any increase in interest rates is uncertain, it is widely expected that interest rates will increase over time, and any such increase will make mortgage financing more expensive and adversely affect the ability of home buyers to purchase our homes. The recent disruptions in the credit markets and the curtailed availability of mortgage financing has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as compared to prior periods.\nBeginning in 2008, the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant instability, beginning with increased defaults on sub-prime loans and other non-conforming loans and compounded by expectations of increasing interest payment requirements and further defaults. This in turn resulted in a decline in the market value of many mortgage loans and related securities. Lenders, regulators and others questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan products and programs. Credit requirements have tightened, and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities has declined. The deterioration in credit quality during the economic downturn caused almost all lenders to stop offering sub-prime mortgages and most other loan products that were not eligible for sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or loans that did not meet Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration requirements. Fewer loan products, tighter loan qualifications and a reduced willingness of lenders to make loans may continue to make it more difficult for certain buyers to finance the purchase of our homes.\nThese factors may reduce the pool of qualified home buyers and make it more difficult to sell to first-time and move-up buyers who have historically made up a substantial part of our homebuilding customers.\nThe liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market. These entities have required substantial injections of capital from the federal government and may require additional government support in the future. Several federal government officials have proposed changing the nature of the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the federal government and even nationalizing or eliminating these entities entirely. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were dissolved or if the federal government determined to stop providing liquidity support to the mortgage market, there would\nbe a reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions. Any such reduction would likely have an adverse effect on interest rates, mortgage availability and our sales of new homes.\nIf suitable mortgage financing is not available to home buyers generally, our home buyers may not be able to sell their existing homes in order to buy a new home from us, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn each of our markets, decreases in the availability of credit and increases in the cost of credit adversely affect the ability of home buyers to obtain or service mortgage debt. Even if potential home buyers do not themselves need mortgage financing, where potential home buyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a new home, increases in mortgage costs, lack of availability of mortgages and/or regulatory changes could prevent the buyers of potential home buyers\u2019 existing homes from obtaining a mortgage, which would result in our potential customers\u2019 inability to buy a new home from us. Similar risks apply to those buyers who are awaiting delivery of their homes and are currently in backlog. Our success depends, in part, on the ability of potential home buyers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of homes. If our customers (or potential buyers of our customers\u2019 existing homes) cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should experience a decline.\nOur business strategy is focused on the acquisition of suitable land and the design, construction and sale of single-family homes in residential subdivisions, including planned communities, in Northern and Southern California, Washington State, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. In California, we principally operate in the Central Valley area, the Monterey Bay area, the South San Francisco Bay area, and the Los Angeles area; in Washington State, we operate in the Puget Sound area. In North Carolina, we principally operate in the Charlotte area. In South Carolina, we principally operate in the Myrtle Beach area, and in Tennessee, we principally operate in the Nashville area. Because our operations are concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn in one or more of these areas, particularly within California, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations.\nAny limitation on, or reduction or elimination of, tax benefits associated with owning a home would have an adverse effect upon the demand for land and homes for residential development, which could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in federal income tax laws may affect demand for new homes and land suitable for residential development. Current tax laws generally permit significant expenses associated with owning a home, primarily mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, to be deducted for the purpose of calculating an individual\u2019s federal and, in many cases, state taxable income. Various proposals have been publicly discussed to limit mortgage interest deductions and to limit the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. If the federal government or a state government changes or further changes its income tax laws, as some lawmakers have proposed, by eliminating, limiting or substantially reducing these income tax benefits, without offsetting provisions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers. Enactment of any such proposal may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general and our business and profits in particular, as the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions could decrease the demand for new homes and land suitable for residential development.\nDifficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could result in an inability to acquire land for development or increased costs and delays in the completion of development projects.\nThe homebuilding and land development industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land parcels and begin development. In addition, if housing markets are not favorable or permitting or development takes longer than anticipated, we may be required to hold our investments in land for extended periods of time. If internally generated funds are not sufficient, we may seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financings and/or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for land acquisition and construction financing, may be greatly reduced nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. The credit and capital markets have in the recent past experienced significant volatility. If we are required to seek additional financing to fund our operations, continued volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access such financing. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures, we may be unable to acquire land for development or to develop housing.\nAdditionally, if we cannot obtain funds required for the purchase of land under our purchase or option contracts, we may incur contractual penalties and fees. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause\nproject delays and any such delay could result in cost increases. Any one or more of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face potentially substantial risk with respect to our land and lot inventory.\nWe intend to acquire land parcels for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current and any new markets we choose to enter. The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land parcels increase as consumer demand for housing decreases. As a result, we may buy and develop land parcels on which homes cannot be profitably built and sold. The market value of land parcels, building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions, and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values. When market conditions are such that land values are depreciating, previously entered into option agreements may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forego deposits, option costs and pre-acquisition costs and terminate the agreements. Land parcels, building lots and housing inventories are illiquid assets and we may not be able to dispose of them efficiently or at all if we are in financial distress. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market. In the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes at significantly lower margins or at a loss, if we are able to sell them at all.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time.\nReal estate investments are relatively difficult to sell quickly. As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing assets for an extended period of time. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.\nAdverse weather and geological conditions may increase costs, cause project delays and reduce consumer demand for housing, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs a homebuilder and land developer, we are subject to the risks associated with numerous weather-related and geologic events which are beyond our control. These weather-related and geologic events include but are not limited to droughts, floods, wildfires, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, soil subsidence and earthquakes. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our land parcels and projects, cause delays in completion of our projects, reduce consumer demand for housing, and cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, any of which could affect our sales and profitability. For example, our California markets are in areas which have historically experienced significant earthquake activity and seasonal wildfires. Other unique meteorological and geographic conditions exist in all of the markets in which we operate.\nIn addition to directly damaging our land or projects, earthquakes, wildfires or other natural events could damage roads and highways providing access to those assets or affect the desirability of our land or projects, thereby adversely affecting our ability to market homes or sell land in those areas and possibly increasing the costs of homebuilding completion.\nThere are some risks of loss for which we may be unable to purchase insurance coverage. For example, losses associated with landslides, earthquakes and other geologic events may not be insurable and other losses, such as those arising from terrorism, may not be economically insurable. A sizeable uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nContinued acquisition activity could expose us to additional risks and future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.\nWe may continue to expand our operations through acquisitions and other strategic transactions. In connection with any such transactions, we may be required to integrate geographically diverse operations, additional employees, and different information technology and management systems, which may involve complex challenges. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to: manage our expansion opportunities; integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner; successfully monitor our operations, costs and regulatory compliance; and develop and maintain other necessary systems, processes and internal controls. We cannot assure you that our expansion or acquisition initiatives will be successful, or that we will realize their expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. For example, we may be required to integrate widely dispersed operations with different corporate cultures, operating margins, competitive environments, computer\nsystems, compensation programs, business plans and growth potential, which would likely require significant management time and attention. This could disrupt our ongoing operations and divert management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. Depending upon the circumstances of any particular acquisition, successful integration may depend, in large part, on retaining key personnel who have, for example, unique experience or business relationships. The loss of key personnel at any business we may acquire could result in a disruption of operations, a loss of information and business relationships, unanticipated recruitment and training costs, and otherwise diminish anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions. Acquisitions could also result in our assumption of unknown contingent liabilities, which could be material, expose us to the risk of impaired inventory and other assets relating to the acquisition, and the risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience. When financing any acquisitions, we may choose to issue additional shares of our Class A common stock or incur substantial additional indebtedness. Issuance of additional shares of Class A common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAccordingly, any acquisition activity could expose us to significant risks, beyond those associated with operating our existing business, and may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operation.\nOur business and results of operations are dependent on the availability and skill of subcontractors.\nSubstantially all of our construction work is done by third-party subcontractors with us acting as the general contractor. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our construction depend on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. We do not have long-term contractual commitments with any subcontractors, and there can be no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in our markets. Certain of the subcontractors engaged by us are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements that require the payment of prevailing wages that are higher than normally expected on a residential construction site. A strike or other work stoppage involving any of our subcontractors could also make it difficult for us to retain subcontractors for our construction work. In addition, union activity or a scarcity of skilled labor supply could result in higher costs to retain our subcontractors. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, despite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper construction practices or installing defective materials in our homes. When we discover these issues, we, generally through our subcontractors, repair the homes in accordance with our new home warranty and as required by law. We reserve a portion of the sales price of each home we sell to satisfy warranty and other legal obligations to our home buyers. We establish these reserves based on market practices, our historical experience, and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. However, the cost of satisfying our warranty and other legal obligations in these instances may be significantly higher than our reserves, and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from such subcontractors. Regardless of the steps we take, we can in some instances be subject to fines or other penalties, and our reputation may be adversely affected.\nLabor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe residential construction industry experiences serious labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople, and supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods following natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. Certain of our markets have recently begun to exhibit a scarcity of skilled labor relative to increased homebuilding demand in these markets. The cost of labor and raw materials may also be adversely affected during periods of shortage or high inflation. During the last economic downturn, a large number of qualified tradespeople went out of business or otherwise exited the market. A reduction in available tradespeople will likely exacerbate labor shortages if demand for new housing continues to increase. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew and existing laws and regulations or other governmental actions may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes that we can build or delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or \u201cslow-growth\u201d or \u201cno-growth\u201d initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees and exactions for projects in their jurisdiction.\nProjects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. As a result, home sales could decline and costs increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our housing projects.\nWe are often required to provide bonds to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects and/or in support of obligations to build community improvements such as roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities. As a result of market conditions, surety providers have been reluctant to issue new bonds and some providers are requesting credit enhancements (such as guarantees, cash deposits or letters of credit) in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds. If we are unable to obtain required bonds in the future for our projects, or if we are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, result in liabilities, limit the areas in which we can build homes and delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment, hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants and human health and safety. The particular environmental requirements which apply to any given site vary according to multiple factors, including the site\u2019s location, its environmental conditions, the current and former uses of the site, the presence or absence of state-listed or federal-listed endangered or threatened plants or animals or sensitive habitats, and conditions at nearby properties. We may not identify all of these concerns during any pre-acquisition or pre-development review of project sites. Environmental requirements and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or in areas contaminated by others before we commence development. We are also subject to third-party challenges, such as by environmental groups or neighborhood associations, under environmental laws and regulations governing the permits and other approvals for our projects and operations. Sometimes regulators from different governmental agencies do not concur on development, remedial standards or property use restrictions for a project, and the resulting delays or additional costs can be material for a given project.\nIn addition, in cases where a state-listed or federally-listed endangered or threatened species is involved and related agency rule-making and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rule-making and litigation can be unpredictable and can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on, or the prohibition of, development and building activity in identified environmentally sensitive areas.\nFurthermore, the Company is evaluating the impact of recent regulatory action under the federal Endangered Species Act on a project that it is developing in Washington State. The project, known as the Preserve at Tumwater Place (the \u201cPreserve\u201d), currently has approximately 462 lots consisting of Divisions 1, 2, 3 and 4. The preliminary residential subdivision was approved by the City of Tumwater and the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife based, in part, on an approved Habitat Protection Plan for the Mazama pocket gopher. Based on that plan, the Preserve contains a 25-acre, on-site habitat preservation area for the gopher. The Preserve has recorded a final subdivision for Division 1. We have obtained building permits from the City of Tumwater for some of the Division 1 lots and are currently building single family homes for sale therein.\nSince these approvals, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cUSFWS\u201d) adopted a final rule listing gopher as \u201cthreatened\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act and designated certain areas of Washington State, including land in close proximity to the Preserve, as critical habitat for the gopher. The listing is broad and applies to areas near critical habitat area, including areas where the gopher may not be present. At this time, the USFWS has not provided guidance as to how USFWS intends to address ongoing development in light of the rule. However, USFWS has indicated that existing set-asides created under state and local authorities, such as the on-site habitat preservation area that we have previously established at the Preserve, will not provide sufficient mitigation for the take of the gopher as a matter of federal law. Accordingly, we will be required to implement additional restrictions and requirements at the Preserve. Any such restrictions or requirements could cause us to incur increased expense at the Preserve or delay or limit our activities there.\nThe recent regulatory action involving the listing of a certain species of gopher as \u201cthreatened\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act may adversely affect this project, for example by imposing new restrictions and requirements on our activities there and possibly delaying, halting or limiting, our development activities. However, an estimate of the amount of impact cannot be made as there is not enough information to do so due to the lack of clarity regarding any restrictions that may be imposed on our development\nactivities or other remedial measures that we may be required to make. We will continue to assess the impact of this regulatory action and will record any future liability as additional information becomes available.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to property and liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully recoverable by insurance. In addition, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies or otherwise be subject to significant deductibles or limits. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur or be subject to deductibles, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future income from that property.\nIn addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles. We may be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property. Material losses or liabilities in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future.\nIncreases in our cancellation rate could have a negative impact on our home sales revenue and homebuilding margins.\nHome order cancellations can result from a number of factors, including declines or slow appreciation in the market value of homes, increases in the supply of homes available to be purchased, increased competition, higher mortgage interest rates, home buyers\u2019 inability to sell their existing homes, home buyers\u2019 inability to obtain suitable financing, including providing sufficient down payments, and adverse changes in economic conditions. Upon a home order cancellation, the escrow deposit is returned to the prospective purchaser (other than with respect to certain design-related deposits, which we retain). An increase in the level of our home order cancellations, due to stringent lending standards or otherwise, could have a negative impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to product liability and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect, product liability and home warranty claims, including moisture intrusion and related claims, arising in the ordinary course of business. While we maintain general liability insurance and generally seek to require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for the liabilities arising from their work, there can be no assurance that these insurance rights and indemnities will be collectible or adequate to cover any or all construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be liable. For example, contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we are often responsible for applicable self-insured retentions (particularly in markets where we include our subcontractors on our general liability insurance and our ability to seek indemnity for insured claims is significantly limited), certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits, and one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent. Further, in the United States, and California in particular, the coverage offered and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and is costly. As a result, an increasing number of our subcontractors may be unable to obtain insurance, particularly in California where we have instituted an \u201cowner controlled insurance program,\u201d under which subcontractors are effectively insured by us.\nFor our projects we obtain liability insurance that generally covers subcontractors. If we cannot effectively recover construction defect liabilities and costs of defense, or if we have self-insured, we may suffer losses. Coverage may be further restricted and become even more costly. Such circumstances could adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any product liability or warranty claims made against us, whether or not they are viable, may lead to negative publicity, which could impact our reputation and our home sales.\nIn addition, we conduct the substantial portion of our business in California, one of the most highly regulated and litigious jurisdictions in the United States, which imposes a ten year, strict liability tail on many construction liability claims. As a result, our potential losses and expenses due to litigation, new laws and regulations may be greater than those of our competitors who have more limited California operations.\nOur operating performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nReal estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. These events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in international, national or local economic and demographic conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in financial conditions of buyers and sellers of properties, particularly residential homes and land suitable for development of residential homes;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including other real estate operating companies and developers and institutional investment funds;\n\u2022\nreductions in the level of demand for and increases in the supply of land suitable for development;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability, or the ability of home buyers, to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nunanticipated increases in expenses, including, without limitation, insurance costs, development costs, real estate assessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in enforcement of laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws, governmental fiscal policies and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\nIn addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in the purchase of homes or an increased incidence of home order cancellations. If we cannot successfully implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nPoor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenue or results of operations to decline.\nResidents of communities we develop rely on us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify our community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop our communities successfully or within expected timeframes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a community generates any revenue, time and material expenditures are required to acquire land, obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. It can take several years from the time we acquire control of a property to the time we make our first home sale on the site. Delays in the development of communities expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. A decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nWe depend on key senior management personnel and other experienced employees.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key senior management personnel including, but not limited to, Dustin L. Bogue, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and James M. Pirrello, our Chief Financial Officer, each of whom would be difficult to replace. Although we entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Bogue and Pirrello, there is no guarantee that these executives will remain employed by us. If any of our key senior management personnel were to cease employment with us, our operating results could suffer. Our ability to retain our key senior management personnel or to attract suitable replacements should any members of our management team leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key senior management personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. We have not obtained key senior management life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of death or disability of any of our key senior management personnel.\nExperienced employees in the homebuilding, land acquisition and construction industries are fundamental to our ability to generate, obtain and manage opportunities. In particular, local knowledge and relationships are critical to our ability to source attractive land acquisition opportunities. Experienced employees working in the homebuilding and construction industries are highly sought after. Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of any of our key personnel could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in real estate values may require us to write-down the book value of our real estate assets.\nThe homebuilding and land development industries are subject to significant variability and fluctuations in real estate values. As a result, we may be required to write-down the book value of our real estate assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), and some of those write-downs could be material. Any material write-downs of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $2.6 million of impairment to real estate inventory in two of our projects, Sundance, located in Bakersfield, California (\"Sundance\"), and Heathers at Westport, located in Charlotte, North Carolina (\"Heathers at Westport\"). For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $0.9 million of impairment to homebuilding real estate inventory in our River Run project, located in Bakersfield, California (\"River Run\"). See Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 9, \"Fair Value Disclosures\" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairment and estimated fair values of real estate inventories included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation could adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, raw materials and labor needed to operate our business. If our markets have an oversupply of homes relative to demand, we may be unable to offset any such increases in costs with corresponding higher sales prices for our homes. Inflation may also accompany higher interest rates, which could adversely impact potential customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby further decreasing demand. If we are unable to raise the prices of our homes to offset the increasing costs of our operations, our margins could decrease. Furthermore, if we need to lower the price of our homes to meet demand, the value of our land inventory may decrease. Inflation may also raise our costs of capital and decrease our purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate our business.\nWe may become subject to litigation, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may become subject to litigation, including claims relating to our operations, financings and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future.\nResolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms.\nCampaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. If we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future, our business could be adversely affected, as such activities could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to current or potential transactional counterparties and financing sources, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If potential or existing transactional counterparties or financing sources choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, we may suffer damage to our reputation (for example, regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations) or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents, including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and the value of our debt securities, resulting in significant loss of value, which could impact our ability to access capital, increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to finance our business on attractive terms.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding and land development industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business.\nAny failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies, governmental authorities and local communities, and our ability to win new business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nActs of war or terrorism may seriously harm our business.\nActs of war, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power or acts of terrorism may cause disruption to the U.S. economy, or the local economies of the markets in which we operate, cause shortages of building materials, increase costs associated with obtaining building materials, result in building code changes that could increase costs of construction, affect job growth and consumer sentiment, or cause economic changes that we cannot anticipate, all of which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology for financial and operational management functions to conduct our operations. Any disruption in these systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Furthermore, we use information technology, digital telecommunications and other computer resources to carry out important operational and promotional marketing activities and to maintain our business records. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify to varying degrees certain security and service level standards. Although we and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security, disaster recovery and other preventative and corrective measures, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources, including our primary websites, are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption or failure or error or poor product or vendor/developer selection (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols), or lost connectivity to our networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources, including our primary websites, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, orders, deliveries of homes and revenues, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and confidential information (including information about our buyers and business partners), and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues, expenses that we may not be able to recover in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties, or their or our insurers. The release of confidential information may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals and/or business partners and/or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines and cause reputational harm, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection against such threats, based on considerations of their evolution, pervasiveness and frequency and/or government-mandated standards or obligations regarding protective efforts, could be material to our consolidated financial statements in a particular period or over various periods.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER\nPICO holds a majority equity interest in our Company and its interests may not be aligned with ours or those of our other investors.\nPICO holds 56.8% of the voting power of UCP, Inc. as of December 31, 2016. For so long as PICO continues to beneficially own a controlling stake in us, PICO will have the power to elect and remove all of our directors and to approve any action requiring the majority approval of our stockholders. PICO also has the power to transfer its controlling stake in our Company. In addition,\npursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement that we entered into with PICO, PICO will have the right to nominate two individuals for election to our board of directors for as long as PICO owns 25% or more of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock and one individual for as long as it owns at least 10% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock (in each case, excluding any shares of our common stock that are subject to issuance upon the exercise or exchange of rights of conversion or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares); and Dustin L. Bogue, our President and Chief Executive Officer, James W. Fletcher, the President of our Northern California Division, and our former Chief Financial Officer, have agreed to vote all shares of our Class A common stock that they own in favor of such PICO nominees in any election of directors for as long as PICO owns at least 10% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. In the event that any board member nominated by PICO shall for any reason cease to serve as a member of our board of directors during his or her term of office, the resulting vacancy on the board will be filled by an individual selected by PICO.\nPICO\u2019s interests may not be fully aligned with ours and those of our other investors, and this could lead to actions that are not in our or in our other investors\u2019 best interests. PICO holds all of the outstanding UCP, LLC Series A Units. Because PICO holds its economic interest in our business through UCP, LLC, rather than through the public company, it may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, PICO may have different tax positions from us which could influence its decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets or incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the TRA that we entered into with PICO, and whether and when we should undergo certain changes of control within the meaning of the Tax Receivable Agreement or terminate the TRA, which would accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. In addition, PICO\u2019s significant ownership in us and resulting ability to effectively control us may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which you as a holder of shares of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for our shares over the then-current market price.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE as a result of the ownership positions and voting rights of PICO. A \"controlled company\" is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company. More than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock is held by PICO. As a controlled company, we are entitled to not comply with certain corporate governance of the NYSE that would otherwise require our board of directors to have a majority of independent directors and our compensation committee and our nominating and corporate governance committee to be comprised entirely of independent directors, have written charters addressing such committee's purpose and responsibilities and perform an annual evaluation of such committee. Accordingly, holders of our Class A common stock do not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and affairs may be reduced.\nAs a result of PICO\u2019s relationship with our Company, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to any transactions involving or with PICO or its affiliates.\nMaxim C. W. Webb, a member of our board of directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of PICO. As a result of our relationship with PICO, there may be transactions between us and PICO that could present an actual or perceived conflict of interest.\nThis conflict of interest may lead Mr. Webb to recuse himself from actions of our board of directors with respect to any transactions involving or with PICO or its affiliates. In addition, Mr. Webb will devote only a portion of his business time to his duties with our board of directors, and he will devote the majority of his time to his duties with PICO and other commitments. PICO or its affiliates may also pursue transactions in competition with us.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which may exacerbate the adverse effect of any declines in our business, industry or the general economy and exposes us to the risk of default. We may be unable to service our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $161.0 million of consolidated outstanding debt (including capital lease obligations) of which $74.9 million was related to our 2017 Notes and $86.9 million for our acquisition and construction loans expected to mature during 2018. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur, our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders or creditors as long as the Company is in compliance with the covenants and restrictions then in effect with its existing lenders. As a result, we may incur significant\nadditional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial outstanding indebtedness, and the limitations imposed on us by the instruments and agreements governing out outstanding indebtedness, could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nour cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;\n\u2022\nwe may use a substantial portion of our cash flows to make principal and interest payments and we may be unable to obtain additional financing as needed or on favorable terms, which could, among other things, have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our development pipeline, capitalize upon emerging acquisition opportunities, fund working capital or capital expenditures, or meet our other business needs;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms or in violation of certain covenants to which we may be subject;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to maintain certain debt and coverage and other financial ratios at specified levels, which may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, thereby reducing our financial flexibility to react to changes in our business;\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions may be increased;\n\u2022\napproximately $81.3 million of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, which exposes us to increased interest expense in a rising interest rate environment;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may default on our indebtedness by failure to make required payments or to comply with certain covenants, which could result in an event of default entitling a creditor to declare all amounts owed to it to be due and payable, and possibly entitling other creditors (due to cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions) to accelerate the maturity of amounts owed to such other creditors or, if such indebtedness is secured, to foreclose on our assets that secure such obligation.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and/or business.\nOur ability to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, complete our development pipeline and fund other planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts (including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future), will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, to refinance our indebtedness when it matures or to fund other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our existing debt instruments restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to service or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn particular, our 2017 Notes, with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $75 million, mature on October 21, 2017. This significant maturity represents approximately 46.3% of our outstanding debt (including capital lease obligations but excluding intercompany liabilities) as of December 31, 2016. Our ability to satisfy this maturity when it becomes due will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which will be subject, in part, to factors beyond our control, including interest rates and general economic, financial and competitive conditions. Our sources of capital to satisfy this maturity may include retained capital, the issuance of equity securities, debt financing and refinancing and asset sales or a combination of any of the foregoing. However, no assurance can be given that any of these sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, or that such sources will enable us to be able to satisfy this maturity. Any refinancing of the 2017 Notes may be on terms less favorable than those applicable to the 2017 Notes. As a result, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to refinance or repay our 2017 Notes as we currently anticipate or at all. Our failure to refinance or repay our 2017 Notes at their stated maturity would have a material adverse impact on\nour financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to achieve our objectives.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including our indenture, contain various covenants and other provisions which limit management\u2019s discretion in the operation of our business, reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks.\nThe agreements governing our existing indebtedness, including the indenture relating to the 2017 Notes, contain covenants and other provisions that impose significant restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. The indenture contains covenants that restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional unsecured and secured indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make certain investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nacquire unimproved real property;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell certain assets; and\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our consolidated assets.\nThese covenants could impair our ability to grow our business, take advantage of attractive business opportunities or successfully compete, and we may be unable to amend, or obtain a waiver of, any applicable covenant in any given situation. In addition, the indenture provides the holders thereof the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of their securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such securities plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase in the event a change of control occurs (which the indenture generally defines as certain persons (excluding PICO) having the right to acquire more than 35% of the voting power of our voting stock).\nThe indenture also requires, and certain of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 acquisition, construction and development loan agreements require, us to maintain specified financial measures and ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios or tests may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Senior Notes\" included elsewhere in this report.\nA breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness or our subsidiaries indebtedness could result in an event of default. Such a default may allow the creditors, if the agreements so provide, to declare the related debt immediately due and payable, as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt agreements if accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, if we were unable to repay or refinance any secured debt that becomes accelerated, the lenders could proceed against any assets pledged to secure that debt, including foreclosing on or requiring the sale of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ownership interests in land parcels (and improvements thereon), and such assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full.\nSecured indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of seizure of the pledged collateral.\nIncurring mortgage and other secured indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our pledged land parcels or other assets, because defaults under such indebtedness may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders. As of December 31, 2016, we had mortgage indebtedness of approximately $86.7 million. This debt is secured by project-level real estate (i.e., real estate held in special purpose entities formed to hold the real estate interests for particular projects).\nAccess to financing sources may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to maximize our returns.\nOur access to additional third-party sources of financing will depend, in part, on:\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perception of our growth potential;\n\u2022\nwith respect to acquisition and/or development financing, the market\u2019s perception of the value of the land parcels to be acquired and/or developed;\n\u2022\nour debt levels;\n\u2022\nour expected results of operations;\n\u2022\nour cash flow; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our Class A common stock.\nCredit spreads for major sources of capital widened significantly during the U.S. credit crisis as investors demanded a higher risk premium. During periods of volatility and weakness in the capital and credit markets, potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing. Investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure additional financing on reasonable terms, if at all.\nDepending on market conditions at the relevant time, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity financings or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities and other purposes. We may not have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all.\nFailure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect us.\nWe currently do not hedge against interest rate fluctuations. We may obtain in the future one or more forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements, interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder. In addition, we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties. Adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable. We could be required to liquidate one or more of our assets at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our assets in order to meet our debt service obligations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE\nOur only material asset is our interest in UCP, LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from UCP, LLC to pay dividends, if any, taxes and other expenses.\nUCP, Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in UCP, LLC. UCP, Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue other than the operations of UCP, LLC that it owns and controls. We intend to cause UCP, LLC to make distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by us, as well as any payments due under the TRA, as described below. Future financing arrangements may contain negative covenants, limiting the ability of our operating subsidiaries to declare or pay dividends or make distributions. To the extent that UCP, Inc. needs funds, and UCP, LLC and/or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulations, or otherwise unable to provide such funds, for example, due to restrictions contained in the indenture governing our 2017 Notes, certain of our subsidiary level project financings or in future financing arrangements that limit the ability of our operating subsidiaries to distribute funds, our liquidity and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nWe are required to pay PICO for a portion of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of tax basis step-ups we receive in connection with future exchanges by PICO of its UCP, LLC Series A Units for shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe UCP, LLC Series A Units held by PICO may in the future be exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock. The exchanges may result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of UCP, LLC that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nWe entered into a TRA with PICO that provides for the payment by us to PICO of 85.0% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of any such increases in tax basis (or are deemed to realize in the case of certain events, as discussed below). Any actual increases in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, cannot be predicted reliably at this time.\nThe increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, and the amount and timing of our income. As a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of UCP, LLC attributable to our interest in UCP, LLC, during the expected term of the TRA, we expect that the payments that we may make to PICO could be substantial.\nWe are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase; however, if the IRS were successful in making such a challenge, PICO would not reimburse us for any payments that may previously have been made under the TRA if it is later determined that we did not receive the anticipated corresponding tax benefit. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments to PICO under the TRA in excess of our cash tax savings. In addition, our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the TRA, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income.\nIn certain cases, payments by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe TRA provides that upon certain changes of control, or if, at any time, we either materially breach our obligations under the TRA or elect an early termination of the TRA, our (or our successor\u2019s) obligations with respect to UCP, LLC Series A Units would be based on certain assumptions, including that (a) all the UCP, LLC Series A Units are deemed exchanged for their fair value, (b) we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the TRA and (c) the subsidiaries of UCP, LLC will sell certain non-amortizable assets (and realize certain related tax benefits) no later than a specified date. In each of these instances (based on the foregoing assumptions), we would be required to make an immediate payment to the holders of such UCP, LLC Series A Units equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits (discounted over the applicable amortization and depreciation periods for the assets the tax bases of which are stepped up (which could be as long as fifteen years in respect of intangibles and goodwill) at a uniform discount rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points). The benefits would be payable even though, in certain circumstances, no UCP, LLC Series A Units are actually exchanged at the time of the accelerated payment under the TRA, thereby resulting in no corresponding tax basis step up at the time of such accelerated payment under the TRA. Accordingly, payments under the TRA may be made years in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the anticipated future tax benefits and may be significantly greater than the benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. We may not be able to finance our obligations under the TRA and our existing indebtedness may limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to us to pay these obligations.\nIn addition, our obligations under the TRA could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control that could be in the best interests of our public stockholders.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from exchanges of UCP LLC Series A Units for shares of our Class A common stock and payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement itself.\nOur ability to benefit from any depreciation or amortization deductions or to realize other tax benefits that we currently expect to be available as a result of the increases in tax basis created by exchanges of UCP LLC Series A Units for shares of our Class A common stock and our ability to realize certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA itself, depend on a number of assumptions, including that we earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which such deductions are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient and/or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected.\nIn the event we acquire more than 50% of all outstanding units of UCP, LLC, we may become subject to additional state and local real estate taxes due to a reassessment of the value of our land holdings for California real estate tax purposes. We may also become subject to California and Washington state and local real estate transfer taxes.\nWe are subject to state and local real estate taxes in California on an annual basis, which are assessed on the basis of the value of our land holdings in the relevant counties. Under Article XIIIA of the California Constitution (known as Proposition 13), California real estate taxes are generally based upon a property\u2019s historic cost (subject to an inflationary increase in value not to exceed 2.0% per year) until the property undergoes a change in ownership or the entity owning the property undergoes a change in control.\nBecause we have acquired our lots over time, the values currently used for assessing these real estate taxes (generally, the price we paid for the lots subject to the allowable inflationary increase in value described in the preceding paragraph) may not fully reflect current market values.\nIf we acquire more than 50.0% of all outstanding units of UCP, LLC (which might occur, for instance, upon an exchange of UCP, LLC Series A Units by PICO pursuant to the Exchange Agreement) it may be treated as triggering a \u201cchange in ownership\u201d for such real estate tax purposes, which, in turn, will result in a reassessment of the values of our lots in California for purposes of our annual real estate tax payments. In such case, the values of our California lots would be reassessed at, and our California real estate taxes would be based on, the then current market value of such lots, which may significantly exceed the price we paid for such lots plus any previously allowed inflationary increase in value. If such reassessment results in an upward adjustment of the values of our California lots, our annual California real estate tax payments will increase. In addition, if we acquire more than 50.0% of the units in UCP, LLC, we may also become subject to one-time California and Washington State and local real estate transfer taxes in respect of our lots in such state. Such additional tax payments would have a negative impact on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nTermination of the employment agreements with the members of our management team could be costly and prevent a change in control of our Company.\nThe employment agreements entered into with our key management team members provide that if their employment with us terminates under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay them significant amounts of severance compensation, thereby making it costly to terminate their employment. Furthermore, these provisions could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our Company that might involve a premium paid for shares of our Class A common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain anti-takeover defenses, applicable law, and provisions of our Registration Rights Agreement, Tax Receivable\nAgreement, Investor Rights Agreement and the indenture relating to our 2017 Notes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.\nOur charter and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our Company that might involve a premium paid for shares of our Class A common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Certain of these provisions are described below.\nSelected provisions of our charter and/or bylaws: Our charter and/or bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that:\n\u2022\ndivide our directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change in our control;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series and establish the rights and other terms of that series;\n\u2022\nrequire that actions to be taken by our stockholders may be taken only at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and other proposals to be brought before a stockholders meeting;\n\u2022\nprovide that our bylaws may be amended by our board of directors without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nallow our directors to establish the size of our board of directors by action of our board of directors, subject to a minimum of three members;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors or newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of our directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\ndo not give the holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nprohibit us from engaging in certain business combinations with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d unless specified conditions are satisfied.\nSelected provisions of Delaware law: We have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which regulates corporate takeovers. However, our charter contains provisions that are similar to Section 203 of the DGCL. Specifically, our charter provides that we may not engage in certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a three-year period following the time that the person became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u2022\nprior to the time that person became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nupon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85.0% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n\u2022\nat or subsequent to the time the person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nGenerally, a business combination includes a merger, consolidation, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with that person\u2019s affiliates and associates, owns, or within the previous three years owned, 15% or more of our voting stock. However, in the case of our Company, PICO and any of its affiliates and subsidiaries and any of their permitted transferees receiving 15% or more of our voting stock will not be deemed to be interested stockholders regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them. This provision could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nRegistration Rights Agreement, Investor Rights Agreement and Tax Receivable Agreement. We entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, an Investor Rights Agreement and a TRA with PICO. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement, PICO may require us to file a registration statement with the SEC relating to the offer and sale of any Class A common stock PICO may receive pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, and PICO has the right to nominate two individuals for election to our board of directors for as long as PICO owns 25.0% or more of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock and one individual for as long as it owns at least 10.0%. In the event that any board member nominated by PICO shall for any reason cease to serve as a member of our board of directors during his or her term of office, the resulting vacancy on the board will be filled by an individual selected by PICO. The TRA provides that upon certain changes of control, PICO may be entitled to a significant early termination payment. These agreements could discourage someone from making a significant investment in us or discourage transactions involving a change in control.\nIndenture Relating to Our Senior Notes. The indenture governing our 2017 Notes, with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $75 million as of December 31, 2016, provides the holders thereof the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of their securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such securities plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase in the event a change of control occurs (which the indenture generally defines as certain persons (excluding PICO) having the right to acquire more than 35% of the voting power of our voting stock). This provision, which could result in a significant cash payment obligation, could discourage someone from making a significant investment in us or discourage a transaction involving a change in control.\nWe may change our operational policies, investment guidelines and our business and growth strategies without stockholder approval, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future.\nOur board of directors determines our operational policies, investment guidelines and our business and growth strategies. Our board of directors may make changes to, or approve transactions that deviate from, those policies, guidelines and strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments or pursuing different business or growth strategies. Under any of these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we must comply with numerous laws, regulations and requirements, including the requirements of the Exchange Act, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act,\u201d related regulations of the SEC and requirements of the NYSE. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly\nand current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.\nThese reporting and other compliance obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources and will cause us to incur significant expenses. We may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, create or outsource an internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing or maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting and financial processes. Furthermore, as we grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our Class A common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements.\nWe could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAny joint venture investments that we make could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority, our reliance on co-venturers\u2019 financial condition and disputes between us and our co-venturers.\nWe may co-invest in the future with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a land acquisition and/or a development. In this event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the acquisition and/or development, and our investment may be illiquid due to our lack of control. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, make poor business decisions or block or delay necessary decisions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OWNERSHIP OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in the indenture governing our 2017 and any other financing instruments and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, investors may need to sell their shares of our Class A common stock to realize a return on their investment, and they may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price paid for.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock or other securities convertible into our Class A common stock could cause the market value of our Class A common stock to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.\nOur board of directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to cause us to issue additional shares of our Class A common stock or to raise capital through the issuance of preferred stock (including equity or debt securities convertible into Class A common stock), options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our board of directors in its sole discretion may determine. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decrease significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our Class A common stock, or the availability of our Class A common stock for future sales, on the value of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock by PICO or another large stockholder or otherwise, or the perception that such sales could occur, may also adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our Class A common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our Class A common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, our creditors including holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings, and holders of any outstanding preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our Class A common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common stock, or both. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our Class A common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and Class A common stock owners bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Class A common stock and diluting their ownership interest in our Company.\nNon-U.S. holders may be subject to United States federal income tax on gain realized on the sale or disposition of shares of our Class A common stock.\nBecause of our holdings in United States real property interests, we believe we are and will remain a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, a non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on any gain realized on a sale or disposition of shares of our Class A common stock unless our Class A common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (such as the NYSE) and such non-U.S. holder did not actually or constructively hold more than 5.0% of our Class A common stock at any time during the shorter of (a) the five-year period preceding the date of the sale or disposition and (b) the non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in such stock. In addition, if our Class A common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market, a purchaser of the stock generally will be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 10.0% of the purchase price. A non-U.S. holder also will be required to file a United States federal income tax return for any taxable year in which it realizes a gain from the disposition of our Class A common stock that is subject to United States federal income tax. We believe that our Class A common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market. However, no assurance can be given in this regard and no assurance can be given that our Class A common stock will remain regularly traded in the future. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A common stock.\nTHE FOREGOING FACTORS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, LIQUIDITY AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK.", "PERMNO": 14042, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "UCP"}
