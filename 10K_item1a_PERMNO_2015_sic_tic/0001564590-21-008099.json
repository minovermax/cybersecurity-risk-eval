These requirements cover virtually all aspects of our business.\nIn particular, the Higher Education Act authorizes Title IV Programs and subjects participants to extensive regulation by ED, state education agencies and accrediting agencies. Our institutions\u2019 participation in education assistance programs administered by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs also subject us to oversight by those agencies.\nIn addition, other federal agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and various state agencies and state attorneys general enforce a broad range of consumer protection and other laws applicable to activities of postsecondary educational institutions, such as recruiting, marketing and the protection of personal information.\nBecause of the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business, we are subject to compliance reviews and audits as well as claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies, students, employees and other third parties. These matters often require the expenditure of substantial time and resources to address and may damage our reputation, even if such actions are eventually determined to be without merit. Further, regulatory requirements are not always clear, and regulatory bodies may sometimes disagree with the way we interpret or apply particular requirements. We have had significant matters pending against us in the past which have resulted in the payment of significant amounts to settle the matters and our agreement to ongoing compliance and operational matters. In this regard, see Item I, \u201cBusiness - Accreditation, Jurisdictional Authorizations and Other Compliance Matters - Other Compliance Matters,\u201d for discussion of agreements undertaken in connection with several recently resolved pending matters.\nIf we fail to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, standards or policies, we could incur financial penalties, restrictions on our operations, loss of federal and state financial aid funding for our students, or loss of authorization to operate our institutions.\nThe extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business may change, in particular as a result of the scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, which could require us to make substantial changes to our business, reduce our profitability and make compliance more difficult.\nThe regulations, standards and policies of our regulators change frequently and are subject to interpretation, and interpretations may change over time. In particular, the Department has promulgated a substantial number of new regulations in recent years that impact our business, including but not limited to multiple versions of the \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations discussed in a separate risk factor below and the gainful employment regulation which was rescinded in 2019.\nThe U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and other laws governing Title IV Programs and annually determines the funding level for each Title IV Program. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation-Legislative Action and Recent Department Regulatory Initiatives,\u201d for more information about the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. In recent years, Congress, the Department, states, accrediting agencies, the CFPB, the FTC, state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation-Scrutiny of the For-Profit Postsecondary Education Sector,\u201d for more information about the focus on our industry. This scrutiny and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections could lead to significant regulatory changes in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and is likely to lead to significant rule-making initiatives by the Department. For example, the change in Department administration and policy objectives under the current Presidential administration may lead to the adoption of a new version of gainful employment regulations. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation-Legislative Action and Recent Department Regulatory Initiatives,\u201d for a brief overview of the former gainful employment regulations and the rescission thereof, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 contains more detail regarding the rescinded regulations. Regulatory change is also likely to continue to be considered by the states and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Many of these changes may be adverse to postsecondary institutions generally or for-profit institutions specifically.\nAs they have in the past, future regulatory changes may have significant impacts on our business, potentially requiring a large number of operational changes, resulting in changes to and elimination of certain educational programs or leading to other fundamental changes to our business. These actions may reduce our student enrollments and profitability or limit our ability to maintain or grow our business. Future regulatory changes may also make compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business more difficult. The risks associated with a failure to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, standards or policies are discussed in the preceding risk factor.\nWe are dependent on the renewal and maintenance of Title IV Programs.\nA substantial majority of our students rely on Title IV Programs to assist in financing their education, and we derive a substantial majority of our revenue and cash flows from Title IV Programs. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 74% of all our students who were in a program of study at any date during that year participated in Title IV Programs, which resulted in Title IV Program cash receipts recorded by the Company of approximately $525 million. As a result, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces Title IV Program funding or the ability of our students to participate, or that places significant additional burdens on or eliminates our ability to participate, would materially reduce the number of students who enroll at our institutions, our revenue and our profitability, and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nIf our institutions become ineligible to participate in educational assistance programs benefitting military or veteran personnel it could have a material negative impact on student enrollments and could have other adverse consequences.\nSome students at our institutions receive education-related benefits pursuant to programs for military or veteran personnel. If any decision is made that reduces our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in educational assistance programs benefitting military or veteran personnel, our actions to appeal that decision may not be successful. In that event, we would experience a decline in student enrollments and revenue, which could be material, unless we are able to increase the number of students unaffiliated with the military who enroll in our programs. In addition, a reduction in our students\u2019 receipt of education assistance for military or veteran personnel would make it more difficult for our institutions to comply with the 90-10 Rule (discussed in the next risk factor).\nOur institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs is too high.\nAny of our institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if, on modified cash basis accounting, the percentage of the cash receipts derived from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years is greater than 90%. Under the 90-10 Rule, an institution that derives more than 90% of its cash receipts from Title IV sources for a fiscal year will be placed on provisional participation status for its next two fiscal years. We have substantially no control over the amount of Title IV student loans and grants sought by or awarded to our students. In addition, if the institution violates the 90-10 Rule and becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continues to disburse Title IV Program funds, the Department would require repayment of all Title IV Program funds received by it after the effective date of the loss of eligibility.\nSeveral factors such as the increase in Title IV Program aid availability, including year-round Pell Grant funds, and budget-related reductions in state grant programs, workforce training programs and other alternative funding sources have adversely affected our institutions' 90-10 Rule percentages in recent years, and we expect this negative impact to continue. We have implemented various measures intended to reduce the percentage of our institutions\u2019 cash basis revenue attributable to Title IV Program funds, including efforts to diversify the sources of our revenue and, in some prior years, managing our cash flow within the parameters permitted by Department cash management regulations. However, these measures may not be adequate to prevent our institutions' 90-10 Rule percentages from exceeding 90% in the future.\nThe ability of our institutions to maintain 90-10 rates below 90% will depend on the composition of our future student population and their personal circumstances and regulatory and other factors outside of our control, including any reduction in government education assistance for military and veteran personnel, or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90-10 rate calculation.\nCurrently, government education assistance for military and veteran personnel, is not treated as revenue from Title IV sources and therefore is included in the \u201c10%\u201d portion of the calculation. However, multiple legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress that would revise the 90-10 Rule to consider government education assistance for military and veteran personnel, in the same manner as Title IV funds or exclude them completely from the calculation for purposes of the rule and to revise the 90-10 Rule to an 85-15 rule. Adoption of these or similar proposals may be more likely following the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections and, if adopted, these proposals would make it more difficult for our institutions to comply with this rule.\nIn addition, there is a lack of clarity regarding some of the technical aspects of the calculation methodology under the 90-10 Rule, which may lead to regulatory action or investigations by the Department or other government bodies. Changes in, or new interpretations of, the calculation methodology or other industry practices under the 90-10 Rule could further significantly impact our compliance with the 90-10 Rule, and any review or investigation by the Department involving us could require a significant amount of resources.\nThe Department may have broad discretion to impose additional sanctions on institutions that fail the 90-10 Rule limit, but there is only limited precedent available to predict what those additional sanctions might be in the future. The Department could specify a wide range of additional conditions as part of the provisional certification and the institutions' continued participation in Title IV Programs. These conditions may include, among other things, restrictions on the total amount of Title IV Program funds that may be distributed to students attending the institutions; restrictions on programmatic and geographic expansion; requirements to obtain and post letters of credit; and additional reporting requirements to include additional interim financial or enrollment reporting.\nSee Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation - Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations - \u201890-10 Rule,\u2019\u201d for more information about the 90-10 Rule and the measures we have implemented to improve our compliance.\nIf any of our institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs due to violation of the 90-10 Rule, the institution would experience a dramatic decline in revenue and would be unable to continue its business as it currently is conducted. Efforts to reduce the 90-10 Rule percentage for our institutions have and may in the future involve taking measures that involve interpretations of the 90-10 Rule or other Title IV regulations that are without clear precedent, reduce our revenue or increase our operating expenses (or all of the foregoing, in each case perhaps significantly). If the 90-10 Rule is changed, we may be required to make structural changes to our business to remain in compliance, which changes may materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely impact our revenue and operating costs. Furthermore, these required changes could make more difficult our ability to comply with other important regulatory requirements, such as the cohort default rate regulations.\n\u201cBorrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations, including closed school discharges, may subject us to significant repayment liability to the Department for discharged federal student loans and posting of substantial letters of credit that may limit our ability to make investments in our business which could negatively impact our future growth.\nOn October 28, 2016, the Department adopted regulations that cover multiple issues including the processes and standards for the discharge of student loans, which are commonly referred to as \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations. Included in the 2016 regulations were expansions of the Department\u2019s authority to process group discharge claims and authority to seek recoupment from institutions. On September 23, 2019, the Department published new final \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d regulations that became effective on July 1, 2020. The processes and standards that apply are determined by the date a student loan is disbursed, and student loans disbursed before July 1, 2017 will follow the Department\u2019s original discharge standards and processes that specify that a borrower may assert a defense to repayment based on an act or omission by the school that would give rise to a cause of action under state law. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation-Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations - Borrower Defense to Repayment,\u201d for more information about the borrower defense to repayment regulations.\nIn addition to discharge of student loans based on an act or omission by a school, Department regulations provide that upon the closure of an institution participating in the Title IV Programs, including any location thereof, certain students who had attended such an institution or location may be eligible to obtain a \u201cclosed school discharge\u201d of their federal student loans related to attendance at that institution or location, if they do not complete their educational programs at another location or online, or through transfer or teach-out with other postsecondary institutions. In order to obtain a closed school discharge, a student generally must have been enrolled or on an approved leave of absence when the institution or location closed. Department regulations historically also provide that students who withdraw from an institution or location within 120 days prior to the closure may receive a closed school discharge; this time period was expanded to 180 days under the 2019 borrower defense to repayment regulations. Additionally, under the 2016 regulations, the Department may grant automatic closed school discharges to students who do not re-enroll in another Title IV-participating institution within three years after becoming unable to complete their educational program due to a closure of their institution or institutional location. Recently, the Department has asserted loan discharge claims against us relating to closed campuses in our former All Other Campuses reporting segment for select students that withdrew or were dismissed from school just prior to a campus closure, despite the availability of a teach-out and opportunity to complete. In addition, pursuant to our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Trident University, Trident University\u2019s operations were brought within the scope of American InterContinental University\u2019s state licensure, accreditation and Department approval, with Trident University relinquishing its accreditor and the Department approvals. As a result, we may incur closed school discharge liabilities if Trident University students do not complete their educational program after the closing of the transaction.\nThe Department\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of the different versions of the borrower defense to repayment regulations, including closed school discharges, and the related processes and standards is uncertain. In addition, the change in Department administration and policy objectives under the current Presidential administration may lead to additional rulemaking initiatives regarding borrower defense to repayment and to changes in the loan discharge process applicable to outstanding claims. If the Department determines that a significant number of borrowers who attended our current, former or acquired institutions have a defense to repayment of their student loans, we could be subject to significant repayment liability to the Department, which may limit our ability to make investments in our business and negatively impact our future growth.\nIn addition to potential liability associated with loan discharges, both the 2016 and 2019 borrower defense to repayment regulations include discussion of triggering events that may provide the Department discretion regarding periodic determinations of our financial responsibility and associated enhanced financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security it determines it needs. If in the future we are required to post a letter of credit pursuant to the borrower defense to repayment regulations, we may not have the capacity to do so. Even if we are able to post any required letter of credit, doing so may limit our ability to make investments in our business which could negatively impact our future growth.\nWe cannot predict the impact the various defense to repayment regulations will have on student enrollments, the volume of future claims for loan discharge, including closed school discharge, or our future financial responsibility as determined by the\nDepartment, all of which could be materially adverse.\nA failure to demonstrate \"financial responsibility\" or \"administrative capability\" would have negative impacts on our operations.\nAll higher education institutions participating in Title IV Programs must, among other things, satisfy financial and administrative standards. Failure to meet these standards may subject an institution to additional monitoring and reporting procedures, the costs of which may be significant; alterations in the timing and process for receipt of cash pursuant to Title IV Programs; a requirement to submit an irrevocable letter of credit to the Department in an amount equal to 10-100% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year; or provisional certification for up to three years; depending on the level of compliance with the standards and the Department\u2019s discretion. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation - Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations,\u201d for more information about the standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability and the alternative ways an institution may establish eligibility to continue to participate in Title IV Programs.\nIf in the future we are required to satisfy the Department's standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis, including potentially by posting irrevocable letters of credit, we may not have the capacity to post these letters of credit.\nAccreditor and state regulatory requirements also address financial responsibility, and these requirements vary among agencies and also are different from Department requirements. Any developments relating to our satisfaction of the Department's financial responsibility requirements may lead to additional focus or review by our accreditors or applicable state agencies regarding their respective financial responsibility requirements.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain financial responsibility or administrative capability, they could lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, have that eligibility adversely conditioned or be subject to similar negative consequences under accreditor and state regulatory requirements, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, limitations on participation in Title IV Programs as a result of the failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability could materially reduce the enrollments and revenue at the impacted institution, and a termination of participation would cause a dramatic decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nOur institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if their student loan cohort default rates are greater than the standards set by the Department.\nTo remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, our institutions must maintain student loan cohort default rates below specified levels. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). The applicable cohort default rate for each cohort is the percentage of the students in the cohort who default on their student loans prior to the end of the two following federal fiscal years, which represents a three-year measuring period. If an educational institution\u2019s cohort default rate exceeds the applicable standards, it may be required to delay for 30 days the release of the first disbursement of U.S. federal student loan proceeds to first time borrowers, establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate, be subject to provisional certification imposing various additional requirements for participating in Title IV Programs or, depending on the duration or magnitude of the compliance failure, cease participation in Title IV Programs.\nSee Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation - Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations - Student Loan Default Rates,\u201d for more information about cohort default rates, the Department\u2019s standards and penalties applicable thereto, the rates for our institutions and how the CARES Act could negatively impact our rates in the future.\nIf either of our institutions loses eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs due to student loan default rates being higher than the Department\u2019s thresholds, we would experience a dramatic decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nOur agreements with multiple state attorneys general and the FTC may lead to unexpected impacts on our student enrollments or higher than anticipated expenses, and a failure to comply may lead to additional enforcement actions.\nAs discussed above, in recent years, states and other regulatory bodies have increased their focus on the for-profit postsecondary education sector. This includes increased activity by state attorneys general and the FTC in their review of the sector. In this regard, in 2019 the Company entered into agreements with the FTC and attorneys general from 48 states and the District of Columbia to bring closure to inquiries by them. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Accreditation, Jurisdictional Authorizations and Other Compliance Matters - Other Compliance Matters\u201d for information about these agreements. These agreements could ultimately have negative impacts on our business, any one of which could be material. For example, pursuant to the agreements with the attorneys general we agreed to work with a third-party administrator that will report annually for three years on the Company\u2019s compliance with various obligations the Company committed to in the agreements. Any negative findings by the third-party administrator may result in negative consequences to the Company, such as an extension of the time period during which the Company must work with the third party administrator or an action by one or more attorneys general seeking enforcement of the agreements. Further, our provision of materials and information in\naccordance with the terms of the agreements that do not align with those provided by other institutions could negatively impact student decisions to enroll or remain enrolled at our institutions. Pursuant to the agreement with the FTC, we agreed to various operating provisions including the operation of a system to monitor lead aggregators and generators involving a compliance review by, or on behalf of, the Company of the various sources a prospective student interacts with prior to the Company\u2019s purchase and use of the prospective student lead. The compliance costs related to these agreements may be greater than anticipated and may have a negative impact on our ability to compete effectively and maintain and grow student enrollments at our institutions, and a failure to comply may lead to additional enforcement actions by the state attorneys general and the FTC.\nIf the Department denies, or significantly conditions, recertification of either of our institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution could not conduct its business as it is currently conducted.\nUnder the provisions of the Higher Education Act, an institution must apply to the Department for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs at least every six years or when it undergoes a change of control. Each institution is assigned an identification number by the Department known as an OPEID, or Office of Postsecondary Education Identification number, with each institution\u2019s branches and additional locations assigned to the main campus\u2019 OPEID. Generally, the recertification process includes a review by the Department of an institution\u2019s educational programs and locations, administrative capability, financial responsibility and other oversight categories. AIU is currently operating on a provisional program participation agreement due to open regulatory review processes with the Department at the time of the renewal. During the period of provisional certification, an institution must obtain prior Department approval to add an educational program, open a new location or make any other significant change, which could negatively impact our ability to take these actions.\nIf the Department finds that any of our institutions do not fully satisfy all required eligibility and certification standards, the Department could limit, suspend or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs. Continued Title IV program eligibility is critical to the operation of our business. If either of our institutions becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs, or have that participation significantly conditioned, it could not conduct its business as it is currently conducted and we would experience a dramatic decline in revenue.\nOur institutions would lose their ability to participate in Title IV Programs if they fail to maintain their institutional accreditation, and our student enrollments could decline if certain of our programs fail to obtain or maintain programmatic accreditation.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department in order to participate in Title IV Programs. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Accreditation, Jurisdictional Authorizations and Other Compliance Matters - Institutional Accreditation.\u201d The failure to comply with accreditation standards will subject an institution to additional oversight and reporting requirements, accreditation proceedings such as a show-cause directive, an action to defer or deny action related to an institution's application for a new grant of accreditation or an action to suspend an institution's accreditation or a program's approval. In August 2016 HLC adopted policy changes giving the Commission discretion to designate an institution as a school \u201cin financial distress\u201d or \u201cunder government investigation.\u201d These designations may result in additional monitoring and/or financial reporting by the institution and a strict scrutiny review by HLC of any requests for substantive change at the institution, requiring the institution to demonstrate a compelling reason for the change and that it has sufficient resources to support the change. In 2019 we resolved inquiries by the FTC and multiple state attorneys general. If similar inquiries occur in the future, the breadth of the conditions that could result in these designations may cause our HLC-accredited institutions, CTU and AIU, to be labeled with one or possibly both. If our institutions or programs are subject to accreditation actions or are placed on probationary accreditation status, we may experience additional adverse publicity, impaired ability to attract and retain students and substantial expense to obtain unqualified accreditation status. The inability to obtain reaccreditation following periodic reviews or any final loss of institutional accreditation after exhaustion of the administrative agency processes would result in a loss of Title IV Program funds for the affected institution and its students. In addition, if an accrediting body of our institutions loses recognition by the Department, that institution could lose its ability to participate in Title IV Programs.\nMany states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited. While programmatic accreditation is not a sufficient basis to qualify for institutional Title IV Program certification, programmatic accreditation may improve employment opportunities for program graduates in their chosen field. Those of our programs that do not have such programmatic accreditation, where available, or fail to maintain such accreditation, may experience adverse publicity, declining enrollments, litigation or other claims from students or suffer other adverse impacts, which could result in it being impractical for us to continue offering such programs.\nWe need timely approval by applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs or make substantive changes to existing programs.\nOur institutions frequently need to obtain approvals from regulatory agencies in the conduct of their business. For example, to establish a new educational program or substantive changes to existing programs, we are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from the Department and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies. Staffing levels at the Department and other regulatory agencies and the volume of applications and other requests may delay our receipt of necessary approvals. Further, approvals may be\nconditioned or denied in a manner that could significantly affect our strategic plans and future growth. Approval by these regulatory agencies may also be negatively impacted due to regulatory inquiries or reviews and any adverse publicity relating to such matters or the industry generally.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial performance depends on the level of student enrollments in our institutions.\nEnrollment of students at our institutions is impacted by many of the regulatory risks discussed above and business risks discussed below, many of which are beyond our control. We also believe that the level of our student enrollments is affected by changes in economic conditions, although the nature and magnitude of this effect are uncertain and may change over time. For example, during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable, prospective students may have more employment options, leading them to choose to work rather than to pursue postsecondary education. On the other hand, high unemployment rates may affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education or to pursue postsecondary education in general.\nAffordability concerns and negative perception of the value of a college degree increase reluctance to take on debt and make it more challenging for us to attract and retain students. We may experience decreasing enrollments in our institutions due to changing demographic trends in family size, overall declines in enrollment in postsecondary institutions, job growth in fields unrelated to our core disciplines or other societal factors. Further, we continue to make investments in our business which are designed to improve student experiences, retention and academic outcomes and support the sustainable and responsible growth of our institutions. The success of these initiatives may reduce over time.\nOur student enrollments could suffer from any of these circumstances. It is likely that legislative, regulatory, and economic uncertainties will continue, and thus it is difficult to assess our long-term growth prospects. Reduced enrollments at our institutions, for any of the reasons mentioned or otherwise, generally reduce our profitability, which, depending on the level of the decline, could be material.\nWe compete with a variety of educational institutions, especially in the online education market, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our student enrollments and revenue could be adversely impacted.\nThe postsecondary education industry is highly fragmented and increasingly competitive. Our institutions compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges and universities, other for-profit institutions, other online education providers, and alternatives to higher education, such as immediate employment and military service. Some public and private institutions charge lower tuition for courses of study similar to those offered by our institutions due, in part, to government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources not available to for-profit institutions, and this competition may increase if additional subsidies or resources become available to those institutions. For example, a typical community college is subsidized by local or state government and, as a result, tuition rates for associate\u2019s degree programs may be much lower at community colleges than at our institutions. Several states have adopted or proposed programs to enable residents to attend community colleges for free.\nSome of our competitors are more widely known and have more established reputations than our institutions. In addition, some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory burdens on enrollment and financial aid processes, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. In particular, some of our publicly traded for-profit competitors have converted to a structure where a for-profit service company provides services to a non-profit educational institution, which reduces the impact of certain regulations on their operations, such as the 90-10 Rule.\nWe also expect to experience increased competition as more postsecondary education providers increase their online program offerings (in particular programs that are geared towards the needs of working adults), including traditional and community colleges that had not previously offered online education programs, and increase their use of personalized learning technologies. This trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional colleges and community colleges. Increased competition may create greater pricing or operating pressure on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions' enrollments, revenues and profit margins. We may also face increased competition in maintaining and developing new corporate partnerships and other relationships with employers, particularly as employers become more selective as to which online universities they will encourage or offer scholarships to their employees to attend and from which online universities they will hire prospective employees.\nCongress, the Department and other agencies have required increasing disclosure of information to prospective students (with some disclosures only required by for-profit institutions), and our agreements with multiple state attorneys general require additional disclosures that are not required by our competitors. Some of these disclosures may negatively impact a prospective student\u2019s decision to enroll in one of our institutions.\nAn increase in competition, particularly from traditional colleges with well-established reputations for excellence, may affect the success of our recruiting efforts to enroll and retain students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, or cause us to\nreduce our tuition rates and increase our marketing and other recruiting expenses, which could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows.\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to develop awareness among, and enroll and retain, students in our institutions and programs in a cost effective manner.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully market and advertise their educational programs, our institutions' ability to attract and enroll prospective students in those programs could be adversely affected. We have been investing in our student admissions and advising functions and other initiatives to improve student experiences, retention and academic outcomes. If these initiatives do not continue to succeed, our ability to attract, enroll and retain students in our programs could be adversely affected. Further, Internet and other technology, including data gathering and marketing and advertising, is changing fast and we may be unable to adapt our initiatives to attract, enroll and retain students in a timely manner. Consequently, our ability to increase revenue or maintain profitability could be impaired. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing our institutions and the programs that they offer include, but are not limited to: student or employer dissatisfaction with our educational programs and services; diminished access to prospective students; our failure to maintain or expand our brand names or other factors related to our marketing or advertising practices; FTC or Federal Communications Commission restrictions on contacting prospective students, Internet, mobile phone and other advertising and marketing media; costs and effectiveness of Internet, mobile phone and other advertising programs; and changing media preferences of our target audiences.\nWe use third-party lead aggregators and generators to help us identify prospective students. The practices of some lead aggregators and generators have been questioned by various regulatory bodies, which could lead to changes in the quality and number of prospective student leads provided by these lead aggregators and generators as well as the cost thereof, which could in turn result in a reduction in the number of students we enroll. Further, the highly regulated nature of the postsecondary education industry and the resulting compliance measures undertaken by the industry are burdensome and some lead aggregators may choose not to work with us in favor of providing their services to different industries. In addition, the number of lead aggregators and generators has reduced over time due to consolidation in that industry, and this could exaggerate the indirect impact on us of any negative developments within that industry or with respect to any lead aggregator or generator with which we do business.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire, train and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur future success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers and other key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract and retain qualified managers and our institutions' ability to attract and retain qualified faculty members and administrators. If any of our executive officers leave the Company, it may be difficult to hire a replacement with similar experience and skills due to the highly regulated nature of our business. The political and regulatory uncertainty facing the for-profit postsecondary education industry may make it difficult to retain key personnel, in particular long-tenured senior officers. Loss of key personnel in the future could impact our growth, lead to changes in or create uncertainty about our business strategies or otherwise impact management's attention to operations.\nOur success and ability to grow depends on the ability to hire, train and retain significant numbers of talented people. We face competition from companies in postsecondary education and other industries in attracting, hiring and retaining personnel who possess the combination of skills and experiences that we seek to implement our business strategy. In particular, our performance is dependent upon the availability and retention of qualified personnel for our student support operations. The negative publicity surrounding our industry sometimes makes it difficult and more expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified and experienced personnel, and the Department\u2019s regulations related to incentive compensation affect our ability to compensate admissions and financial aid personnel. Our ability to effectively train our student support personnel and the length of time it takes them to become productive also impacts our results of operations.\nRegulatory changes impacting the for-profit postsecondary education sector may require us to make substantial changes to our business and explore alternative business strategies to maintain or grow our business. If our executive officers and other key personnel lack experience necessary to support these changes, we may be unable to timely attract the talent that we need.\nKey personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us after any period they are contractually obligated not to pursue such activities. The loss of the services of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, train and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms and in a timely manner could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changing market needs and technology.\nIncreasingly, prospective employers of students who graduate from our institutions demand that their new employees possess appropriate technological skills and also appropriate \u201csoft\u201d skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These desired skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment, so it is important for our institutions\u2019 educational programs to evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. Current or prospective students or the employers of our graduates may not accept expansion of our existing programs, improved program content and the development of new programs. Students and faculty increasingly rely on personal communication devices and expect that we will be able to adapt our\ninformation technology platforms and our educational delivery methods to support these devices and any new technologies that may develop. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new and improved programs in a cost-effective manner, our institutions may not be able to begin offering them as quickly as prospective students and employers would like or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur future results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, such as goodwill.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review our non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, including goodwill, for impairment on at least an annual basis through the application of fair value-based measurements. On an interim basis, we review our assets and liabilities to determine if a triggering event had occurred that would result in it being more likely than not that the fair value would be less than the carrying amount for any of our reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Some factors that management considers when determining if a triggering event has occurred include reviewing the significant inputs to the fair value calculation and any events or circumstances that could affect the significant inputs, including, but not limited to, financial performance, legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, political, business or other factors, industry and market conditions as well as the most recent quantitative fair value analysis for each reporting unit and the amount of the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, based on discounted cash flow, and a market-based approach. To the extent the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income. Our estimates of fair value are based primarily on projected future results and expected cash flows consistent with our plans to manage the underlying businesses, including projections of newly acquired businesses such as the Trident acquisition. However, should we encounter unexpected economic conditions or operational results, have unforeseen complications with integration of newly acquired businesses or need to take additional actions not currently foreseen to comply with current and future regulations, the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our assets, estimate of future cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates, could be negatively impacted and could result in an impairment of goodwill which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on proprietary rights and intellectual property in conducting our business, which may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names and agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on service mark and trademark protection in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to our marks as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. These measures may not be adequate, and we can\u2019t be certain that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights. Unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content despite our efforts to protect these rights. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to use funds for lawsuits to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.\nWe may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. Some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.\nIn some instances our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards or download third-party content to personal computers. We may incur claims or liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit.\nRisks Related to Our Business Technology Infrastructure\nWe are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations due to our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of those laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nOur efforts to attract and enroll students result in us collecting, using and keeping substantial amounts of personal information regarding applicants, our students, their families and alumni, including social security numbers and financial data. We also maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our activities. Our services, the services of many of our health\nplan and benefit plan vendors, and other information can be accessed globally through the Internet. We rely extensively on our network of interconnected applications and databases for day to day operations as well as financial reporting and the processing of financial transactions. Our computer networks and those of our vendors that manage confidential information for us or provide services to our students are vulnerable to unauthorized access, inadvertent access or display, theft or misuse, hackers, computer viruses, or third parties in connection with hardware and software upgrades and changes. Such unauthorized access, misuse, theft or hacks can evade our intrusion detection and prevention precautions without alerting us to the breach or loss for some period of time or may never be detected. We have experienced malware and virus attacks on our systems which went undetected by our virus detection and prevention software. Regular patching of our computer systems and frequent updates to our virus detection and prevention software with the latest virus and malware signatures may not catch newly introduced malware and viruses or \u201czero-day\u201d viruses, prior to their infecting our systems and potentially disrupting our data integrity, taking sensitive information or affecting financial transactions. Because our services can be accessed globally via the Internet, we may be subject to privacy laws in countries outside the U.S. from which students access our services, which laws may constrain the way we market and provide our services. Any breach of student or employee privacy or errors in storing, using or transmitting personal information could violate privacy laws and regulations resulting in fines or other penalties. The adoption of new or modified state or federal data or cybersecurity legislation could increase our costs and require changes in our operating procedures or systems. An example of this is the California Consumer Privacy Act which became effective January 1, 2020. A breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or result in lawsuits, additional regulation, remediation and compliance costs or investments in additional security systems to protect our computer networks, the costs of which may be substantial.\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our online technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nFor our online and ground-based campuses, the performance and reliability of program infrastructure is critical to their operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system or software error or failure, significant increase in traffic on our computer networks, or any significant failure or unavailability of our computer networks or third-party software, including but not limited to those as a result of natural disasters and network and telecommunications failures, could materially disrupt our delivery of these programs. Any interruption to our institutions\u2019 computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on our student enrollments.\nOur computer networks are also vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other security threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks hackers may target our networks. We expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches and may incur significant expenditures to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. We cannot ensure that our efforts will protect our computer networks against security breaches despite our regular monitoring of our technology infrastructure security.\nAny general decline in Internet use for any reason, including security or privacy concerns, cost of Internet service or changes in government regulation, could result in less demand for online educational services and inhibit growth in our online programs.\nOur remote work environment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate the risks related to our business technology infrastructure.\nWe have transitioned almost all of our employees to remote work, as have a number of our third-party service vendors, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid transition to a remote work environment may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including increasing the stress on, and our vulnerability to disruptions of, our technology infrastructure and systems, and increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, unauthorized dissemination of confidential information and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue or other event occurs that impacts the ability of employees to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a period of time, which could be substantial. While most of our operations can be performed remotely, there is no guarantee that we will be as effective while working remotely because our team is dispersed, many employees may have additional personal needs to attend to (such as looking after children as a result of school closures or family who become sick), and employees may become sick themselves and be unable to work.\nGovernment regulations relating to the Internet could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe increasing use of the Internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or in foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales and use taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or\nmore jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs and adversely affect enrollments.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future, and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are not in our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe actual, anticipated or perceived impact of changes in the political environment or government policies;\n\u2022\nthe outcomes and impacts on our business of the Department\u2019s rulemakings, and other changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate;\n\u2022\nnegative media coverage of the for-profit education industry;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the postsecondary education field, including declining enrollments;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, accreditation reviews, regulatory reviews, inquiries and investigations, and any related adverse publicity;\n\u2022\nfailure of certain of our institutions or programs to maintain compliance under the 90-10 Rule or other regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet or exceed, or changes in, expectations of analysts or investors, or the extent of analyst coverage of our company;\n\u2022\ndecisions by any significant investors to reduce their investment in us;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results, which sometimes occur due to the academic calendar and significant expense items that do not regularly occur;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, which may cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the market as a whole; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nChanges in the trading price of our common stock may occur without regard to our operating performance, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company. Further, the trading volume of our common stock is relatively low, which may cause our stock price to react more to the above and other factors. The fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may impact an investor\u2019s ability to sell their shares at the desired time at a price considered satisfactory, including at or above the price at which the investor acquired them.", "PERMNO": 85724, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "PRDO"}
