Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic impacts have had and are likely going to continue to have certain adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic and efforts to control its spread have resulted in a substantial decline in global economic activity, caused disruptions in global supply chains and created significant volatility in financial markets. Governments around the world have implemented stringent preventative measures to contain the spread of the virus, including stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions, together with business, government and school closures. These measures have resulted in reduced demand for fuel and other related products and services, negatively impacting our results of operations in 2020, and led to a decline in fuel prices beginning in early 2020. This was further exacerbated by disagreements regarding crude oil-production levels between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members and other large oil producing countries (\u201cOPEC+\u201d), as well as related global storage considerations. While OPEC+ members have since agreed on production cuts, there is uncertainty as to whether such agreement will continue to be observed by its members or that the agreed production cuts will be sufficient to offset continuing demand weakness.\nIn response to the pandemic, we took prompt action beginning in the first quarter of 2020 to ensure the safety of our employees and other stakeholders, as well as commenced a number of initiatives relating to cost reduction, liquidity and operating efficiencies throughout the balance of the year. However, it is uncertain whether such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or a prolonged economic downturn, and our ability to successfully execute our business operations could be adversely impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business, in addition to the risks described throughout this section, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022disruptions in our supply chains due to transportation delays, travel restrictions, cost increases, and closures of businesses or facilities;\n\u2022extended periods of reduced demand and volatile fuel prices that impact our sales volume and related profitability;\n\u2022delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies;\n\u2022other liquidity challenges, such as reduced availability under our senior credit facility due to financial covenant restrictions tied to our financial performance;\n\u2022losses on hedging transactions with customers arising from sudden changes in fuel prices;\n\u2022disruptions resulting from office and facility closures and changes in operating procedures, including additional cleaning and disinfecting procedures;\n\u2022possible infections or quarantining of our employees which could impact our ability to service our customers or operate our business;\n\u2022increased costs associated with the rationalization of our portfolio of businesses and other restructuring activities;\n\u2022asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill, along with other accounting charges if expected future demand for our products and services materially decreases;\n\u2022volatility in the global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital and additional sources of financing in the future;\n\u2022assertion of force majeure or other claims by customers, suppliers and other third parties for their non-performance;\n\u2022reduction of our global workforce to adjust to market conditions, including increased severance costs, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements;\n\u2022heightened risk of cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyber-attacks in a remote connectivity environment; and,\n\u2022a structural shift in the global economy and its demand for fuel and related products and services as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession.\nWe are monitoring and continue to assess the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses and operations. While many governments have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus policies intended to counteract the adverse economic impact of the pandemic, the effectiveness of such actions remains uncertain. We expect the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its effect on our financial condition and results of operations, to be dictated by future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the speed and effectiveness of efforts to contain and combat the virus, including vaccine development and distribution, the possibility of subsequent widespread outbreaks and the impact of actions taken by governments and businesses in response, the ultimate impact on global economic activity and how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume on a sustainable basis globally, as well as the extent and duration of the effect of the crisis on consumer confidence and spending.\nThe pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Accordingly, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could increase our costs and/or reduce the demand for our products, which could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. For additional information on the impact of the pandemic, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview.\"\nCOVID-19 pandemic related impacts affecting the aviation, marine and land transportation industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on the global economy generally, as well as the aviation, land and marine transportation industries, where companies operating in these sectors have experienced substantial declines in demand arising from the various measures enacted by governments around the world to contain the spread of the virus. Commercial passenger airlines and cruise lines have been particularly impacted by the travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders, and various other customers in each of our segments have also been adversely affected by such restrictions, as well as the extended shutdown of various businesses and schools in affected regions. As a result, we experienced a sharp decline in sales volume and profitability across our aviation, land and marine segments beginning in the second quarter of 2020, which persisted throughout the balance of the year and may continue for an extended period of time. The ultimate magnitude and duration of these adverse impacts on our business will depend on the timing and extent to which the global economy, and our customers in the aviation, land and marine transportation industries in particular, recover from the current crisis and return to normalized operating levels.\nStrategic & Operational Risks:\nWe extend credit to most of our customers in connection with their purchase of fuel and services from us, and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected if we are unable to collect accounts receivable.\nOur success in attracting customers has been due, in part, to our willingness to extend credit on an unsecured basis to customers as opposed to requiring prepayment, letters of credit or other forms of credit support. Even in cases where we do obtain credit enhancements, such as guarantees, offset rights, collateral or other forms of security, such rights may not be sufficient or fully collectible depending on the circumstances of the customer at the time of default. Furthermore, the diversification of our credit risk is limited, as we primarily conduct business within the aviation, land and marine transportation industries.\nOur exposure to credit losses depends primarily on the financial condition of our customers and other factors beyond our control, such as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on the global transportation industry, the extent of deteriorating conditions in the world economy or in the industries we serve, significant changes in oil prices and political instability. For example, during 2020 our provision for bad debt was materially higher, principally in our aviation segment, due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry arising from the global restrictions on air travel. While we actively manage our credit exposure and work to respond to changes in our customers\u2019 financial condition and other macroeconomic events, there can be no guarantee we will be able to mitigate these risks successfully. Substantial credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA material portion of our profitability is derived from sales to government customers, particularly sales to NATO in Afghanistan, and the loss or material reduction in business from such sales, would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nSales to government customers represent a material portion of our profitability. In particular, sales to NATO in support of military operations in Afghanistan accounted for approximately 14% of our consolidated gross profit in 2020. The current contract for these sales to NATO has been renewed through December 2021, with an additional one-year renewal option remaining at NATO's discretion. There is no guarantee that NATO will exercise the remaining renewal option.\nThe level of troop deployments and military-related activities can cause our government customer sales to vary significantly and materially impact our operating results. Specifically, the U.S. government has announced its intention to significantly reduce the level of U.S. troops in the Middle East, including the troops supporting NATO in Afghanistan. In the early part of 2020, the U.S. entered into an agreement with the Taliban where it agreed to reduce the level of troops and negotiate a full withdrawal by 2021, subject to various conditions, including a peace agreement being reached between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. The U.S. government thereafter moved forward with a significant reduction in the level of troops throughout 2020 and we experienced a material decline in demand during 2020. While the exact timing and full impact of the troop withdrawal remain uncertain, we expect to continue to experience further reductions in demand through 2021.\nSales to government customers can also be materially impacted by factors such as supply disruptions, border closures, road blockages, hostility-related product losses, inventory shortages and other logistical difficulties that can arise when sourcing and delivering fuel in areas that are actively engaged in war or other military conflicts. Moreover, there is a risk of serious injury or loss of life of our employees or subcontractors operating in these high-risk locations. We therefore, may incur substantial operating costs as a result of, among other things, hostility-related product losses, utilizing alternate supply routes or maintaining the safety of our personnel, particularly where our facilities are likely to be targeted by terrorist activity.\nFinally, due to complex supply logistics, the indefinite nature of government contracts, and the associated risks of doing business in areas engaged in war or military conflict, sales of products and services to government customers in support of military operations typically carry significantly higher net margins than sales to commercial customers. As a result, a significant decrease in sales to our government customers, or loss of a key contract, such as our NATO agreement, would result in a disproportionate reduction in our consolidated operating income and, thus, would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in the market price of fuel may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFuel prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including global economic conditions, changes in global crude oil and natural gas prices, expected and actual supply and demand for fuel, the ability or willingness of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, geopolitical conditions, laws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those mandating or incentivizing alternative energy sources or otherwise addressing global climate change, energy conservation efforts and technological advances affecting energy consumption or supply, regulatory changes in commodities markets, and weather and natural disasters.\nDuring times of high fuel prices, our customers may not be able to purchase as much fuel from us because of their credit limits with us and the resulting adverse impact on their business could cause them to be unable to make payments owed to us for fuel purchased on credit. In addition, if fuel prices increase, our own credit limits could prevent us from purchasing enough fuel from our suppliers to meet our customers\u2019 demands or could require us to prepay for fuel purchases which would adversely impact our liquidity.\nConversely, extended periods of low fuel prices, particularly when coupled with low price volatility, can also have an adverse effect on our results of operations and overall profitability. This can occur due to many factors, such as reduced demand for our price risk management products and decreased sales to our customers involved in the oil exploration sector. Low fuel prices also facilitate increased competition by reducing financial barriers to entry and enabling existing, lower-capitalized competitors to conduct more business as a result of lower working capital requirements.\nFinally, we maintain fuel inventories for competitive or logistical reasons. Because fuel is a commodity, we have no control over the changing market value of our inventory though we may manage or hedge this price exposure with derivatives. A rapid decline in fuel prices could cause a reduction in our inventory valuation, resulting in our inventory being marked down in value or the inventory itself sold at lower prices. While we attempt to mitigate these fluctuations through hedging, such hedges may not be fully effective. Accordingly, if the market value of our inventory is less than our average cost and to the extent our hedges are not effective at mitigating fluctuations in prices, we could record a write-down of inventory on hand and incur a non-cash charge or suffer losses as fuel is sold, which could adversely impact our earnings.\nAdverse conditions or events affecting the aviation, marine and land transportation industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is focused on the marketing of fuel and other related products and services primarily to the aviation, land and marine transportation industries, which are generally affected by economic cycles. Therefore, weak economic conditions can have a negative impact on our customers' business which may, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, our business and that of our customers can be adversely impacted by political instability, terrorist activity, piracy, military action, transportation, terminal or pipeline capacity constraints, natural disasters and other weather-related events that disrupt shipping, flight operations, land transportation or the availability of fuel, which may negatively impact sales of our products and services. Any additional political or governmental developments or other global health concerns or crises in the countries in which we or our customers operate, could also result in further social, economic or labor instability. Accordingly, the effects of any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties on us or our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinally, our business could also be adversely affected by merger activity in the aviation, land or marine transportation industries, which may reduce the number of customers that purchase our products and services, as well as the prices we are able to charge for such products and services. Larger shipping companies and airlines often have greater leverage and have a greater ability to buy directly from major oil companies and suppliers. Accordingly, this can negatively impact our value proposition to these types of customers and increases the risk of disintermediation.\nOur physical operations have inherent risks that could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating fuel storage and distribution terminals and transporting fuel products involve inherent risks, including:\n\u2022fires, collisions and other catastrophic disasters;\n\u2022traffic accidents, injuries and loss of life;\n\u2022spills, discharges, contaminations and other releases;\n\u2022severe damage and destruction of property and equipment; and,\n\u2022loss of product and business interruption.\nAny of the foregoing could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, government-imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims, or damage to our properties and the properties of others. The occurrence of any of these events could also damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business, whether or not we are ultimately held financially liable for such event. While we keep business continuity plans to address these types of contingencies, our failure to timely or properly implement these plans could exacerbate the impact on the business. We generally maintain insurance for these types of events, however, certain losses may be in excess of coverage limits or outside the scope of the coverage. If we are held liable for any material damages, and the liability is not adequately covered by insurance, our financial position and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.\nIn addition, as we invest more heavily in physical assets in certain locations, our ability to quickly reposition our business in the event of a downturn in the economy of a particular geographic area becomes increasingly more difficult. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur significant costs in maintaining or even exiting a physical location, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFinally, some of our employees, including certain of our drivers that transport and deliver fuel products, are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements. Additional unionization of our workforce or any renegotiation of current collective bargaining agreements may result in terms that are less favorable to us. Any strike, work stoppage or other dispute with our own union employees or those of third parties who provide us services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to provide products or services to our customers as agreed, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent on the availability and supply of fuel and fuel related products, as well as the satisfactory performance of services by us or third parties on our behalf. If the fuel and other products we sell or the services we provide, whether directly or through a third party, fail to meet the specifications we have agreed to with customers or are mandated by law or regulation, such as the International Maritime Association's low sulfur fuel oil requirements, our relationship with our customers could be adversely affected and we could be subject to material claims and liabilities. We could also incur material liabilities if such products cause physical damage to a vessel or aircraft, bodily injury or result in assertion of substantial claims of civil liability against us. Also, adverse publicity about any allegations of contaminated products may negatively impact our business, regardless of whether such allegations are true.\nAlthough most of our agreements with suppliers provide that we have recourse against them for products that fail to meet contractual specifications, such recourse may be time-barred or otherwise insufficient to adequately cover the liability we may incur and our ability to enforce such recourse may be limited or costly. For example, several of our supply agreements are with foreign entities, including foreign governments, and are governed by the laws of foreign jurisdictions. We may incur substantial costs in seeking to enforce our rights against a local supplier in a foreign jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome can be unpredictable. In certain markets, we also rely on a single or limited number of suppliers to sell us fuel or provide services on our behalf and therefore, we may have limited alternatives if such supplier fails to meet applicable standards or requirements. Any of the foregoing can result in material liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage and ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change and the market and regulatory responses relating to GHG emissions could have a significant impact on our operations and financial results.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been adopted and will likely continue to be made at various levels of government globally to monitor and limit GHG emissions or reduce the use of hydrocarbon-based fuels. These include the adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. In 2015, various countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce GHG emissions and calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions by submitting emission reduction goals every five years after 2020. We, along with many of our customers and suppliers, have also established goals to reduce carbon emissions throughout our supply chain. The achievement of current or future internal initiatives relating to the reduction of GHG emissions, however, may increase our costs both in the near and long-term, particularly if they require significant changes to our operations, infrastructure or business lines.\nIn the U.S., various federal, state and local laws and regulations have been enacted relating to GHG emissions. However, the direction of future U.S. climate change regulation is difficult to predict given the potential for policy changes under different Presidential administrations and Congressional leadership. Although the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2020, President Biden has signed executive orders recommitting the U.S. to the agreement and calling for the federal government to begin formulating emissions reduction goals and increasing the emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. It remains unclear what, if any, additional actions the Biden administration will take and to what extent any new environmental laws or regulations, or any repeal of existing environmental laws or regulations, will impact our business or that of our customers.\nThere have also been significant governmental incentives and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative fuels in the U.S. and throughout the world. A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing more fuel-efficient engines, hybrid engines and alternative clean power systems. The more successful these alternatives become, as a result of governmental incentives or regulations, technological\nadvances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise, the greater the potential negative impact on pricing and demand for our fuel products and accordingly, our profitability.\nFurther changes in regulatory policies or any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could also result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to GHGs, harm our reputation and adversely impact our sales of fuel products. Numerous institutional investors and financial institutions have indicated a focus on matters affecting the environment, which may result in reduced investments in, or financing available to, industries that emit GHG emissions. Many of these groups believe that climate change will significantly influence many companies\u2019 long-term prospects and have developed environmental, social and governance standards to measure companies\u2019 performance. Unfavorable ratings under these evolving standards or benchmarks could adversely impact our business, stock price or access to capital.\nFinally, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and vary amongst the geographic areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, hurricanes, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures that may impact the seasonality of our business, such as our heating oil business in the U.K. The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could increase our costs and the prices we charge our customers, reduce the demand for our products, and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImplementation of our growth strategy may place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems.\nA key element of our business strategy has been the growth of our business through acquisitions and strategic investments and divestitures. However, this growth strategy may place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems and expose us to additional risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u2022our ability to effectively and efficiently integrate the operations, financial reporting, IT systems, technology, and personnel of acquired businesses and manage acquired businesses or strategic investments while maintaining uniform standards, risk management and controls appropriate for a public company;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022potentially negative impact of changes in management on existing business relationships and other disruptions of the acquired business;\n\u2022acquiring businesses or entering into markets in which we may have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022our ability to retain key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022reduced liquidity if we use a material portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to fund acquisitions;\n\u2022capital expenditure requirements that exceed our estimates and impact the return on our investment;\n\u2022assumption of material liabilities, exposure to litigation, regulatory noncompliance or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022no or limited indemnities from sellers in an acquisition or ongoing indemnity obligations to purchasers in a divestiture.\nThese risks may result in an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition or result in costs that outweigh the financial benefit of such opportunities. We may also incur significant expenses in connection with these acquisitions or strategic investments or consummate potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund the purchase or ongoing operations of the acquired business. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, inhibit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise restrict our operations.\nWe may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and other strategic investments.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have been pursuing acquisition opportunities and strategic investments such as joint venture arrangements or equity investments intended to complement or expand our business portfolio. The success of our growth strategy depends on our ability to find attractive acquisition or investment candidates or strategic investments and consummate such transactions on economically acceptable terms. Before making acquisitions or strategic investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each transaction. Our due diligence investigation may not reveal or highlight all relevant risks that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Consequently, these transactions could result in unanticipated costs and liabilities that may impact our results of operations and increased demands on our cash resources that may, among other things, impact our ability to explore other opportunities. If our acquisitions or strategic investments do not achieve the financial results anticipated, it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, expenses related to the integration of acquisitions. Transaction and integration expenses could exceed the savings and synergies that we expect to achieve in the future from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale. Any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInformation technology (\u201cIT\u201d) failures and data security breaches, including as a result of cybersecurity attacks, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, subject us to increased operating costs, and expose us to litigation.\nWe rely heavily on digital technologies, including both internal and third party IT systems, network infrastructure and cloud applications and services, to support a variety of business processes and activities across our global operations. Despite our implementation of various security and other protective measures, our technology systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, power outages, telecommunications failure, programming or operational errors, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. These systems are also subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as hacking, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, misconduct by our employees or those of third-party providers, and other unauthorized access, release, corruption or loss of data. Given the nature of cybersecurity attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, our reliance on email transmissions over public networks also exposes us to risks associated with the failure of our employees, customers, business partners and other third parties to use appropriate controls to protect sensitive information, due to risks associated with online social engineering (e.g. phishing and impersonation), fraud and email scams. External parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, suppliers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or use electronic means to induce us to enter into fraudulent transactions. While we regularly conduct employee training and implement security measures and programs designed to prevent and mitigate cybersecurity threats and online fraud and email scams, past and future occurrences of any of the foregoing could damage our brand, competitiveness and ability to conduct our business, impact our credit and risk exposure decisions, cause us to lose customers or revenues and subject us to significant remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions, fines and penalties.\nIn addition, due to the large number of transactions that run through our systems each day, significant system downtime or disruption could have a material impact on our, and in the case of our technology offerings, our customers\u2019, ability to conduct business, process and record transactions, make operational and financial decisions or damage our reputation with customers or suppliers, particularly in the event of billing errors or payment delays. Similarly, if ours or any of our cloud service providers\u2019 access to cloud-based platforms and services is disrupted for any reason and leads to disruptions in our critical systems, our operations and ability to manage our business could be adversely impacted. While we seek to obtain contractual protections in our agreements with these providers, we may not have sufficient recourse against these parties in the event they experience a significant cybersecurity attack or other security breach and our or our customers\u2019 data is compromised.\nAs cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to dedicate significant additional resources and incur substantial costs to modify or enhance our security measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities. Despite these efforts, we may be unable to fully anticipate or implement adequate preventive measures or mitigate potential harm. To our knowledge, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cybersecurity attacks, however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future. We currently maintain insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents. However, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from such incidents.\nSales to government customers involve unique risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to other business risks, our supply of products and services to government customers subjects us to unique risks, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022dependence on government spending on defense programs, which can be negatively affected by budgetary constraints, changes in defense spending policies, government shutdowns and changes in military policies or priorities;\n\u2022contract awards that are typically made through a competitive bidding process, which can involve substantial costs and managerial time to prepare and submit bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us;\n\u2022complexities associated with government contracting, including extensive procurement regulations, contracts for indefinite delivery (where there are no guarantees on the quantity or timing of the purchases); and, the ability of government customers to unilaterally modify certain terms and conditions in existing contracts or terminate existing contracts for their convenience.\nGovernment customers routinely audit government contractors to review contract performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated may not be reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, may need to be refunded and could subject us to a variety of government claims. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business. Improper or illegal activities, including those caused by our subcontractors, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. See Part I. Item 1. of this 2020 10-K Report for additional details regarding applicable laws and regulations.\nFinancial, Economic & Market Risks:\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nBecause we offer fuel products and services on a worldwide basis, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:\n\u2022trade protection measures and import, export and other licensing requirements, which could increase our costs or prevent us from doing certain business internationally;\n\u2022higher costs associated with hiring and retaining senior management for overseas operations;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, which could reduce our productivity;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements, which may be costly and require significant time to implement;\n\u2022caws restricting us from repatriating profits earned from our activities within foreign countries;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including operating within economies susceptible to recessions or severe currency devaluations;\n\u2022governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights or the inability to obtain or retain authorizations required to conduct our business;\n\u2022political risks, including changes in governments, corruption and uncertain regulatory environments; and,\n\u2022terrorism, war, civil unrest and natural disasters and other weather-related events.\nAdditionally, we have substantial operations in the U.K., particularly in our land segment, and the U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. in January 2020 (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) may adversely affect our business in the U.K. and the relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. After an 11-month transition period, in December 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. announced a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal which has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021 but is subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before it comes into effect. However, we continue to face risks associated with the unavoidable uncertainties related to Brexit and the new relationship between the U.K. and E.U., including potential disruption of our supply chains and the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to tax regulations and certain licenses or other rights granted to us under E.U. laws. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the U.K. and the other economies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to seasonal variability, which has caused our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and can adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal variability. Seasonality results from numerous factors, including traditionally higher demand for natural gas and home heating oil during the winter months and for aviation and land fuel relating to increased travel during the summer months, as well as other seasonal weather patterns. As such, our results for the second and third quarters of the year tend to be the strongest for our aviation segment and our results for the fourth and first quarters of the year tend to be the strongest for our land segment. However, extreme or unseasonable weather conditions can substantially reduce the demand for our products and services or significantly increase the prices of the fuel products we sell which can, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations. For example, unseasonably warm winter weather in the U.S. and U.K. in recent years has adversely impacted our results in the land segment. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurances that the seasonal variability will continue in future periods. Accordingly, results for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for such quarter the following year or for the full fiscal year. These seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results can therefore adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nA material impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets could reduce our earnings or adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhen we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Factors that could affect whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization, changes in our marketing or branding strategy, reduced estimates of future cash flows in our annual operating plan and slower growth rates in our industry. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires us to make judgments and assumptions based on a number of factors including industry experience, the economic environment and our projections of future operating performance. If our estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, there is the potential for a partial or total impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill within one or more of our reporting units.\nIn the past, we have recorded impairment charges in connection with various factors such as exiting certain markets or lines of business. Due to continual changes in market and general business conditions, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our goodwill and long-lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods. Any resulting impairment loss would have a negative effect on our results of operations. See Note 7. \"Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\" within \"Part IV. Item 15. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" for more information.\nWe may be unable to realize the level of benefit that we expect from our restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives which may hurt our profitability and our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nWe have in the past and may, in the future, divest of certain non-core assets, exit lines of businesses that are not achieving the desired return on investment or generate low or highly variable economic value, or otherwise restructure certain of our operations to improve operating efficiencies, cost competitiveness and profitability. We have also engaged in various cost reduction initiatives and restructuring activities in recent years and expect to continue to evaluate areas for additional restructuring and cost reduction opportunities, as well as potential divestitures. We may not be able to achieve the level of benefit that we expect to realize from our past or future restructuring activities or divestitures. For example, we may be unable to produce returns on the reinvestment of proceeds that are greater than that of the divested activity. Further, these types of restructuring activities could result\nin unintended consequences such as diversion of our management and employees\u2019 attention from ongoing business operations, business disruption, including as a result of any interconnectivity between our retained business and the one divested, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, potential loss of key customers, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity or morale, which could adversely affect our business. Finally, restructuring activities and divestitures may result in restructuring charges and material write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as ongoing indemnity obligations to purchasers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition and, if we are not able to effectively compete in our markets, our revenues and profits may decrease.\nCompetitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. Our competitors are numerous, ranging from large multinational corporations, which have significantly greater capital resources than we do, to relatively small and specialized firms. Industry developments, such as fuel price transparency, procurement technology tools, increased regulation and increasing customer sophistication may, over time, reduce demand for our services and thereby exacerbate the risks associated with competition. In addition, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of fuel and related products and services in certain markets. These parties may have significant negotiating leverage over us, and if they are unable or unwilling to supply us on commercially reasonable terms, our business would be adversely affected.\nIn addition to competing with resellers, we also compete with the major oil producers that market fuel and other energy products directly to the large commercial airlines, shipping companies and commercial and industrial users. In recent years, a low fuel price environment has caused many major oil companies to remain in or re-enter the downstream markets. Our business could be adversely affected and subject to the risk of disintermediation if our suppliers choose to increase their direct marketing to compete with us or provide less advantageous price and credit terms to us than to our fuel reseller competitors.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to adequately finance our capital requirements and fund our investments, which, if not available to us, would impact our ability to conduct our operations.\nWe rely on credit arrangements with banks, suppliers and other parties as an important source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow. Future market volatility, generally, and persistent weakness in global energy markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms. If we are unable to obtain credit on acceptable terms or at all, such as in the event there is a substantial tightening of the global credit markets or a substantial increase in interest rates, it could have a negative impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as our future development and growth. In addition, if we are unable to obtain debt or other forms of financing and instead raise capital through equity issuance, existing shareholders would be diluted.\nOur business is also impacted by the availability of trade credit to fund fuel purchases and an actual or perceived decline in our liquidity or business could cause our suppliers to reduce our credit lines, seek credit support in the form of additional collateral or otherwise materially modify their payment terms. Adverse changes in our payment terms from principal suppliers, including shortened payment cycles or requiring prepayment, could impact our liquidity, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, our Credit Facility and Term Loans impose certain operating and financial covenants on us, which, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, incur additional debt, create liens and sell a material amount of assets. Our failure or inability to comply with the requirements of these facilities, including meeting certain financial ratios or other covenants, could limit the availability under our Credit Facility or result in an event of default. An event of default, if not cured or waived, would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under these facilities, could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements to which we are a party (such as certain derivative contracts), and would impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur derivative transactions with customers, suppliers, merchants and financial institutions expose us to price and credit risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our price risk management services, we offer customers various pricing structures for the purchase of energy products, including derivatives products designed to hedge exposure to fluctuations in energy prices. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into fixed forward contracts with some of our counterparties under which we agree to sell or purchase certain volumes of energy products at fixed prices. In addition, we may act as a counterparty in over-the-counter swap transactions with some of our customers where the customer may be required to pay us in connection with changes in the price of the underlying energy product. Further, we may use derivatives to hedge price risks associated with our fuel inventories and purchase and sale commitments. We typically hedge our price risk in any of the foregoing types of transactions by entering into derivative instruments with large energy companies, trading houses and financial institutions.\nIf we have not required a customer to post collateral in connection with a fixed forward contract or swap transaction and there is an outstanding mark-to-market liability owing, we will have effectively extended unsecured credit to that customer and such amounts could be substantial. Based on the volatility of energy prices, our counterparties may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their fixed forward contracts or swap transactions. In such cases, we would be exposed to potential losses or costs associated with any resulting default. For example, in the event the spot market price of fuel at the time of delivery is substantially less than the fixed price of the contract with the customer, a customer could default on its purchase obligation to us and purchase the fuel at a lower \u201cspot\u201d market price from another supplier. Meanwhile, we may have entered into a corresponding commitment with a supplier to offer our customer specified fixed pricing or terms and would be obligated to perform our fixed price purchase obligations to such supplier. Similarly, the counterparties with whom we may hedge our price risk exposure may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their swap transactions.\nIf we are unable to recover losses from a defaulting counterparty, we could sustain substantial losses that would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our hedging activities also result in additional costs and can require cash deposits for margin calls. If there is a sudden a significant change in fuel prices, the amount of cash necessary to cover margin calls can be material and impact our liquidity.\nWe are exposed to various risks in connection with our use of derivatives which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe enter into financial derivative contracts primarily to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in energy products, to offer our customers energy pricing alternatives to meet their needs, to manage price exposures associated with our inventories, and to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our efforts to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in energy prices and exchange rates may be ineffective in certain instances. For example, we hedge jet fuel prices with derivatives tied to other petroleum products that have historically been correlated to aviation jet fuel (e.g. heating oil in the U.S. or gasoil in Europe or Asia). If the price of aviation jet fuel at a specific location experiences a divergence to historical correlations, our attempts to mitigate price risk associated with our aviation business may not be effective. Moreover, there may be times where the change in the price of jet fuel at a specific location is disrupted (e.g. hurricanes) and is not correlated to the underlying hedges when compared to historical prices.\nWe may also enter into proprietary derivative transactions, which are not intended to hedge our own risk but rather make a profit by capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities associated with basis, time, quality or geographic spreads related to the energy products we sell. Proprietary derivative transactions, by their nature, expose us to changes in the underlying commodity prices of the proprietary positions taken. Although we have established limits on such exposure, any adverse changes could result in losses which can be further exacerbated by volatility in the financial and other markets. In addition, our employees may fail to comply with our policies and procedures with respect to hedging or proprietary trading, such as engaging in unauthorized trading activity, failing to hedge a specific price risk or failing to comply with our internal limits on exposure or any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the enforceability of our derivative transactions may depend on our compliance with applicable statutory, commodity and other regulatory requirements, which if violated could lead to our derivative transaction being voided, as well as penalties and fines. The impact of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, many of our derivative transactions are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and therefore, changes in the fair market value of these derivatives are reflected as a component of revenue or cost of revenue (based on the underlying transaction type) in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Since the fair market value of these derivatives is marked to market at the end of each quarter, changes in the value of our derivative instruments as a result of gains or losses may cause our earnings to fluctuate from period to period.\nLegal & Regulatory Risks:\nChanges in U.S. or foreign tax laws or adverse outcomes from governmental challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign taxes, including income taxes and taxes imposed on the purchase and sale of aviation, marine and land fuel products, such as sales, excise, value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d), energy, environmental and other taxes. We have also benefited from an income tax concession in Singapore since 2008, which reduces the income tax rate on qualified sales and derivative gains and losses. Our current five-year concession period began January 1, 2018 and is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds which, if not met, may eliminate the benefit beginning with the first year in which the conditions are not satisfied. Our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in our tax expense and the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, our failure to comply with tax regulations or the loss of the tax concession.\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings that could affect the valuation of our net deferred tax assets. We are regularly audited by various domestic and foreign tax authorities and are involved in various inquiries, audits, challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including Brazil, Denmark, South Korea and the U.S., where the amounts under controversy may be material. We are in the process of addressing and responding to inquiries in various jurisdictions and challenging a number of tax assessments in several administrative and legal proceedings, each of which is at various stages in the process. In some jurisdictions, these challenges require the posting of collateral or payment of the contested amount, which may affect our flexibility in operating our business or our liquidity.\nAlthough we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. If these challenges are ultimately determined unfavorably to us, these proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions and damage to our reputation. See \"Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" within \"Part IV. Item 15. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" included in this 2020 10-K Report for additional details regarding certain tax matters.\nTax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries are organized and conduct operations may also change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which among other things, reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions, and credits. In addition, the Tax Act required a one-time transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings. The final impact of the transition tax and other aspects of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other items, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, or any actions taken under the new administration to repeal or otherwise amend the Tax Act.\nFinally, ongoing developments including the project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d), European Commission anti-tax avoidance directives (\u201cATAD\u201d), and other initiatives, could adversely affect our worldwide effective tax rate. With the finalization of specific actions contained within the OECD\u2019s BEPS study, many OECD countries have begun to implement the actions and update their local tax laws, including ATAD directives. The extent to which countries in which we operate adopt and implement these actions could have a material adverse impact on our income tax expense, effective tax rate, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to extensive laws and regulations, including environmental protection, health and safety, that can result in material costs and liabilities.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and other regulations at the international, federal, state/provincial and local government levels in the countries in which we operate. See Part I. Item 1. For additional information about laws and regulations applicable to our business. In particular, laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, can be particularly complex and can impose strict liability on us for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. Violations of these laws and regulations, or any future environmental law or regulation, could result in significant liability, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, or the suspension or termination of our operations at an affected area. We may also be held responsible for remediation costs for natural resource damages as well as third-party damages. In our marine segment, we utilize fuel delivery barges and store refined products adjacent to water, thereby potentially subjecting us to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of where a spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the U.S. Any of these occurrences and any resulting negative media coverage could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, increasingly stringent U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations have resulted and will likely continue to increase our operating costs. For example, compliance with existing and future laws that regulate the delivery of fuel by barge, truck, vessel, pipeline or railcar; or fuel storage terminals or underground storage tanks that we own, lease or operate may require significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs, particularly as we acquire businesses with more physical assets. In addition, continuing changes in environmental laws and regulations may also require capital expenditures by our customers or otherwise increase our customers\u2019 operating costs, which could in turn, reduce the demand for our products and services or impact the pricing or availability of the products we sell. Although the ultimate impact of any regulations is difficult to predict accurately, the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business or on the businesses of our customers.\nThe data that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, loss or misuse, and our handling of such data may be impacted by changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, which could increase operational costs or result in regulatory penalties or litigation.\nIn connection with various businesses we operate, we have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data from our employees, customers (both corporate and individual consumers), suppliers and other third parties, some of which may be subject to privacy, security or residency laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, retain, process, and transmit such data across national boundaries. Despite our efforts to properly handle and protect this information in compliance with such requirements, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, and programming, procedural or human errors that could potentially lead to such information being compromised or handled improperly.\nThere has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal data and security of data transfers, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The evolving nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), Australia, Brazil and other countries where we have operations and customers could impact our processing of this data, including requiring us to make costly changes to our IT systems to properly handle such data. For example, the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes strict rules on handling personal data related to the E.U. and imposes significant sanctions for violations. We have substantial operations in the E.U. and are therefore subject to these heightened standards. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), grants certain rights to California residents with respect to their personal data and requires companies take or refrain from taking certain actions. As interpretation and enforcement of these and other future data privacy, security or residency laws, regulations and industry standards evolve, it may create a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we cannot yet determine the full impact such laws, regulations, and requirements may have on our business, our failure to adequately comply with them could lead to substantial fines, penalties, third-party liability, remediation costs, potential cancellation of existing contracts and the inability to compete for future business. We have taken steps to address the requirements of GDPR, CCPA and other applicable data privacy regulations, however, these steps may not prevent all data security breaches or ensure full compliance with all data privacy-related regulations or customer requirements, and any significant breach of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to a number of international trade control, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws that can impose substantial compliance costs and expose us to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nOur global operations are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d), anti-money laundering laws, international trade controls, and competition laws. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of improperly influencing official decisions or improperly obtaining or retaining business and may also apply to commercial bribery.\nAs part of our business, we operate in countries with a high degree of corruption and frequently interact with state-owned enterprises and government officials. This may increase the risk of improper payments being demanded of, offered by, or made by one of our employees or a party acting on our behalf. The risk of enforcement has also grown in recent years as more of the countries in which we operate have passed anti-corruption laws and prioritized enforcement of those laws which can result in significant fines and penalties.\nInternational trade controls, including economic sanctions such as those administered by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), export controls and anti-boycott regulations, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, are complex and continually changing. Additional restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive OFAC administered sanctions. While such activities currently represent an immaterial amount of our consolidated revenue and income and are undertaken pursuant to general and/or specific licenses issued by OFAC or as otherwise permitted by applicable sanctions regulations. However, these activities may expose us to a heightened risk of violating trade control regulations, which could result in significant penalties.\nWe have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with these laws and regulations. Such policies and procedures may not always prevent us, our employees or parties acting on our behalf from violating these laws and regulations. Violations may expose us to criminal or civil penalties, or other adverse consequences including the denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, and/or revocations or restrictions of licenses. In addition, the costs associated with responding to a government investigation and remediating any violations can be substantial. Furthermore, violations could trigger an event of default under our Credit Facility, which if not waived, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, cause cross-defaults under other agreements to which we are a party, and impair our ability to obtain working capital advances or letters of credit. Accordingly, violations could adversely affect, among other things, our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75070, "SIC": 5172, "TIC": "INT"}
