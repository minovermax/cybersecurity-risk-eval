{"cik": "795212", "company": "TRANS WORLD ENTERTAINMENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of certain factors, which could affect the financial results of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the availability of new products.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the release of \u201chit\u201d music and video titles, which can create fluctuations in sales. It is not possible to determine the timing of these fluctuations or the future availability of hit titles. The Company is dependent upon the major music and movie producers to continue to produce hit products. To the extent that new hit releases are not available, or not available at prices attractive to consumers, or, if manufacturers fail to introduce or delay the introduction of new products, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the continued declines in the video and music industries.\nThe video and music retailing industries are mature industries and have experienced declines in recent years. Physical video and music represent our largest product categories in terms of sales and have been impacted by new distribution channels, including digital distribution and internet fulfillment. As a result, the Company has had negative comparable store sales for the past five years.\nIf we cannot successfully diversify our product mix and implement our business strategy our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted. Our future results will depend, among other things, on our success in implementing our business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our business strategy or that the strategy will be successful in sustaining acceptable levels of sales growth and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may suffer if the Company does not accurately predict consumer acceptance of new product, distribution technologies or adapt to a shift to multichannel experience.\nThe entertainment industry is characterized by changing technology, evolving format standards, and new and enhanced product introductions. These\ncharacteristics require the Company to respond quickly to technological changes and understand the impact of these changes on customers\u2019 preferences. If the Company is unable to participate in new product or distribution technologies, its results of operations may suffer. Specifically, CD and DVD formats have experienced a continuous decline as digital forms of music and video content have become more prevalent. If the Company does not timely adapt to these changing technologies or sufficiently focus on the other categories, operating results could significantly suffer.\nIn addition, multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving with the increasing use of computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in stores and online and the increased use of social media as a means of interacting with our customers and enhancing their shopping experiences. If we are unable to adapt to the gowth of multichannel retailing and keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors, customer experience could be negatively affected, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and satisfaction, and lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nIncreased competition from existing retailers, including internet retailers, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company competes with a wide variety of entertainment retailers, including deep-discount retailers, mass merchandisers, consumer electronics outlets, internet retailers and independent operators, some of whom have greater financial and other resources than the Company and frequently sell their product at discounted prices or with added value.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers. The retail business is highly competitive. In the past, the Company has been able to compete successfully by differentiating our customer shopping experience, by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, customer service and marketing efforts. Customer perceptions regarding our stores, our in-stock position and deep assortment of product are also factors in our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross profit and expenses. If we fail to continue to positively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business is influenced by general economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. General economic conditions impacting discretionary consumer spending include, among others, wages and employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. A downturn in the economy affects specialty retailers disproportionately, as consumers may prioritize reductions in discretionary spending, which could have a direct impact on purchases of our merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, reduced consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nDisruption of global capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources.\nDistress in the financial markets has in the past and can in the future result in extreme volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs.\nHistorically, we have experienced declines and we may continue to experience fluctuation in our level of sales, results from operations and operating cash flow.\nA variety of factors has historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable stores sales results and profit margins. These factors include general regional and national economic conditions; competition; actions taken by our competitors; consumer trends and preferences; new product introductions and changes in our product mix; timing and effectiveness of promotional events and weather. The Company\u2019s comparable store sales may decline further than they did in Fiscal 2014. Also, they may vary from quarter to quarter as our business is highly seasonal in nature. Our highest sales and operating income historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter, which is due in part to the holiday selling season. The fourth quarter generated approximately 35% of our net sales for Fiscal 2014. Any decrease in our fourth quarter sales, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, unseasonable weather conditions, economic conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year. There is no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth, and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to open new stores or renew existing leases in profitable stores may limit our earnings.\nHistorically, the Company\u2019s growth has come from adding stores. The Company opens new stores if it finds desirable locations and is able to negotiate suitable lease terms for profitability. A lack of new store growth may impact the Company\u2019s ability to increase sales and earnings. The\nCompany opened six new stores in Fiscal 2014. Likewise, the Company regularly renews leases at existing locations if those stores are profitable. Failure to renew these leases may impact the Company\u2019s earnings. See Item 2: Properties, for timing of lease expirations.\nA change in one or more of the Company\u2019s vendors\u2019 policies or the Company\u2019s relationship with those vendors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, the Company could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s purchases come from ten major suppliers. As is standard in its industry, the Company does not maintain long-term contracts with its suppliers but instead makes purchases on an order-by-order basis. If the Company fails to maintain customary trade terms or enjoy positive vendor relations, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf the Company\u2019s vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe manufacturers of entertainment products have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. As part of this support, the Company receives cooperative advertising and other allowances from these vendors. These allowances enable the Company to actively promote and merchandise the products it sells at its stores and on its websites. If the Company\u2019s vendors fail to provide this support at historical levels, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nParties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.\nThe Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nBreach of data security could harm our business and standing with our customers.\nThe protection of our customer, employee and business data is critical to us. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of all such data, including confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means, including deceiving our employees or third party service providers. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. We have implemented and regularly review and update our control systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of customer payment card or personal information or employee personal or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, harm our business and have an adverse impact upon our net sales and profitability. As the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the credit card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations.\nOur hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, theft or intrusion that could harm our business.\nOur success, in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels and process customer transactions, largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory at the store level and aggregate daily sales information, communicate customer information and process purchasing card transactions, process shipments of goods and report financial information.\nAny failure of our computer hardware or software systems that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales and profitability. Additionally, if any data intrusion, security breach, misappropriation or theft were to occur, we could incur significant costs in responding to such event, including responding to any resulting claims, litigation or investigations, which could harm our operating results.\nLoss of key personnel or the inability to attract, train and retain qualified employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its future prospects depend, to a significant extent, on the services of its executive officers. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel. The loss of the services of certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers and other key management personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition to our executive officers, the Company\u2019s business is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain a large number of qualified team members. Many of those team members are employed in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, health care costs and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, customer service levels and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with increased wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Chairman owns approximately 46.9% of the outstanding Common Stock. Therefore, he has significant influence and control over the outcome of any vote of the Company\u2019s Shareholders.\nRobert J. Higgins, Chairman of the Board of the Company owns approximately 46.9% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company, as of March 31, 2015 and there are no limitations on his acquiring shares in the future. Accordingly, Mr. Higgins has significant influence over the election of our directors, the appointment of new management and the approval of actions requiring shareholder approval, such as adopting amendments to our articles of incorporation and approving mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. Such concentration of ownership and substantial voting influence may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, even if a change of control is in the best interest of all shareholders. There may be instances in which the interest of Mr. Higgins may conflict or be perceived as being in conflict with the interest of a holder of our securities or the interest of the Company.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce (none of which is represented by unions) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes impacting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer\u2019s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining units are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates.\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Global Market, as well as applicable employment laws. Additional legal and regulatory requirements increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in damage to our reputation, financial condition and market price of our stock.\nWe could be materially and adversely affected if our distribution center is disrupted.\nWe operate a distribution center in Albany, New York. We ship approximately 76% of our merchandise inventory through our distribution center. If our distribution center is destroyed or disrupted for any reason, including weather, fire, labor, or other issues we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes to reopen or replace the center.\nWe maintain business interruption insurance to protect us from the costs relating to matters such as a shutdown, but our insurance may not be sufficient, or the insurance proceeds may not be timely paid to us, in the event of a shutdown.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced and could continue to experience volatility and could decline, resulting in a substantial loss on your investment.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including global economic conditions, broad market fluctuations and public perception of the prospects for music and the home video industry. Changes in our comparable store net sales could also affect the price of our Common Stock. Failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to comparable store sales, net revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock.\nIn addition, an active trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained, which could affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares and could depress the market price of their shares. The stock market in general and the market for video and music industry related stocks in particular, has been highly volatile. For example, the closing price of our Common Stock at quarter ends has fluctuated between $3.36 and $4.00 from January 30, 2013 to March 31, 2015. Investors in our Common Stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nThe declaration of dividend payments or the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program may not continue.\nOur dividend policy may be affected by, among other items, business conditions, changes in our business strategy, our views on potential future capital requirements, the terms of our debt instruments, legal risks, changes in federal income tax law and challenges to our business model. Our dividend policy may change from time to time and we may or may not continue to declare discretionary dividend payments. Additionally, although we have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, we are not obligated to make any purchases under the program and we may discontinue it at any time.\nThe failure to maintain a minimum closing share price of $1.00 per share of our Common Stock could result in the delisting of our shares on the NASDAQ Global Market, which would harm the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nIn order to retain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Market we are required by NASDAQ to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. Our stock price is currently above $1.00 and has been since October 6, 2009. However, in the event that our stock did close below the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for any 30 consecutive business days, we would regain compliance if our Common Stock closed at or above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive days during the 180 days immediately following failure to maintain the minimum bid price. If we are unable to do so, our stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, transferred to a listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or delisted from the NASDAQ markets altogether. The failure to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Market could harm the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 10514, "SIC": 5735, "TIC": "KSPN"}
