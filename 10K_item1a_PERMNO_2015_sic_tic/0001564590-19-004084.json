If any of the events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report occurs, or if any other risks of which we are not presently aware occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Need for Additional Financing and Our Financial Results\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. We do not currently have any products approved for sale, and we continue to incur significant research and development and general and administrative expenses. We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net loss applicable to common stockholders was $331.9 million, and as of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $963.9 million.\nTo date, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials, and we have not commercialized any product candidates. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we:\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approval for eptinezumab;\n\u2022\nmanufacture eptinezumab at commercial scale;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure for eptinezumab;\n\u2022\nenhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support our commercialization efforts for eptinezumab;\n\u2022\nundertake additional clinical trials for eptinezumab; and\n\u2022\ncontinue the research and development of, and undertake any of the foregoing activities for, ALD1910 and our other product candidates.\nTo be profitable in the future, we and any of our future collaborators must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products with significant market potential. This will require success in a range of activities, including advancing product candidates, completing clinical trials of product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval and reimbursement coverage for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which regulatory approval is obtained. We are only in the preliminary stages of some of these activities. We and any of our future collaborators may not succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are sufficient to be profitable in the future.\nDrug development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty. We have never generated any revenues from product sales and may never be profitable.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to developing our technology platform, identifying product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. We have not completed the development of any products and have never generated revenues from the sale of any products.\nOur ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability depends in large part on our ability, on our own or with any of our future collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, and commercialize our product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of products until 2020 at the earliest, if at all. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends on our and any of our future collaborators\u2019 success in:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval for eptinezumab;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully establishing sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure for eptinezumab;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;\n\u2022\nlaunching and commercializing eptinezumab, if approved;\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining an acceptable safety profile for eptinezumab following approval;\n\u2022\nachieving a favorable cost of goods sold;\n\u2022\nobtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for eptinezumab from third-party payors;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies, including capturing market share;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approvals for ALD1910 or any future product candidates that we discover and successfully develop;\n\u2022\nentering into collaboration agreements with third parties with respect to eptinezumab, ALD1910 or our other product candidates for their development and commercialization in the United States or in international markets, and the continued financial and other support of these third parties under such collaboration agreements; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining, protecting, expanding and enforcing our intellectual property, including intellectual property we license from third parties.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biologic product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses and when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if ever. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or foreign regulatory agencies, to perform studies and trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate, or if there are any delays in our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates. If one or more of the product candidates that we independently develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing such product candidates.\nWe will need additional funds to support our operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which would force us to delay, reduce or suspend our research and development programs and other operations or commercialization efforts.\nWe are primarily focused on the advancement of eptinezumab through the clinical development process to a commercial launch, as well as the advancement of the ALD1910 program and future product candidates. The completion of the development and the potential commercialization of our product candidates, should they receive regulatory approval, will require substantial funds.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $407.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, and $5.0 million in restricted cash. We believe that our available cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash as of December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into 2020 and the anticipated commercial launch of eptinezumab. These operating requirements consist principally of expenditures related to the establishment of the eptinezumab commercial drug supply chain, continued build-out of our commercial organization (e.g., marketing, sales, medical affairs, payor access, information technology) and pre-launch market readiness activities. We have based our estimate on the timing for our projected expenditures on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will need additional funding to execute or sustain the commercial launch of eptinezumab. Furthermore, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization of eptinezumab sooner than planned. We will also need to obtain substantial additional sources of funding to develop and commercialize ALD1910 and our other product candidates.\nOur future financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of commercialization activities for eptinezumab if it receives regulatory approval, including sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe degree and rate of market acceptance of eptinezumab;\n\u2022\nrepayment of the 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, or the Convertible Notes, which mature on February 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted;\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress, recruitment and cost of future clinical trials for eptinezumab, ALD1910 and any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, commercialization or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; and\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we may enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials or with commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe do not have any material committed external source of funds or other support for our development efforts. Until we can generate sufficient revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs through equity financings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient amounts of funding on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional capital through equity financings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financings, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, buying or selling assets, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nFurthermore, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. In January 2019, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to commence an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering program, or the ATM program, under which we are permitted to offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having a maximum aggregate offering price of up to $100 million.\nA failure to raise additional funding or to effectively implement cost reductions could harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur significant level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incurred significant indebtedness and substantial debt service requirements as a result of our offering of the Convertible Notes in February 2018. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in connection with financing acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes does not limit the amount of debt that we or our subsidiaries may incur. Our indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough cash to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to you and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Convertible Notes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy, and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our availability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general purposes.\nIn addition, the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service the Convertible Notes and any other debt we may incur, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Convertible Notes, and to fund future capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on (as well as any cash due upon conversion of) our debt, including the Convertible Notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, or to selling assets, seeking additional capital or restructuring or refinancing our debt, including the Convertible Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nPursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report greater losses in our financial statements because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes. In addition, there are features within the terms that are considered to be embedded derivatives and could be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a liability should the value of the derivative increase to be more than inconsequential. We will be required to recognize changes in the derivative\u2019s fair value from period to period in other income (expense) in our statements of operations.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of our common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will be able to use the treasury stock method or the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $914.7 million, for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance, which may be used to offset future taxable income. In addition, we have U.S. research and development tax credit carryforwards of $18.3 million. The pre-2017 NOLs and tax credit carryforwards expire in various years beginning in 2024, if not utilized, while 2018 NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to historical or future ownership change rules pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code. We performed a section 382 ownership analysis through 2018 and determined that an ownership change occurred in 2015. Based on the analysis performed, however, we do not believe that the Section 382 annual limitation will impact our ability to utilize the tax attributes that existed as of the date of the ownership change in a material manner. If we have experienced an ownership change in the past or will experience an ownership change as a result of future changes in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control, the tax benefits related to the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be further limited or lost.\nA key provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d) made changes to the existing NOL deduction and carryforward credit for companies with these deferred tax assets. Any NOL generated in years after December 31, 2017 will now be allowed to be carried forward indefinitely, but will be limited to 80% of taxable income. Carryback of post-2017 NOLs will not be allowed, however NOLs generated prior to the TCJA are still subject to their existing expiration periods and permitted to be carried back for two years.\nThe recently passed comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, that significantly changes the Code. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Any federal net operating loss carryovers created in 2018 and thereafter will be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the TCJA. We continue to examine the impact this tax legislation may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of the TCJA on holders of our securities is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nRisks Related to Eptinezumab and Our Other Product Candidates\nIf eptinezumab is not successfully commercialized, our business will be harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources into the development of eptinezumab to prevent migraines. Our ability to generate revenues from products, which we do not expect to occur until 2020 at the earliest, if at all, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of eptinezumab. The success of eptinezumab and our other product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to reach agreements with the FDA and other regulatory authorities on the appropriate regulatory path for approval for eptinezumab or other product candidates;\n\u2022\nreceipt of approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States for eptinezumab or other product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully launching sales, marketing and distribution of any product candidate that may be approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance of any approved product by the medical community, third-party payors and patients and others involved in the coverage and reimbursement process, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, in the United States and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom;\n\u2022\nachieving a favorable cost of goods sold;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies, including capturing market share;\n\u2022\nachieving a continued acceptable safety profile of the product following approval; and\n\u2022\nobtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims, including intellectual property we license from third parties.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner, or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would harm our business.\nIf clinical trials of eptinezumab or any of our other product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of eptinezumab or any of our other product candidates, we or any of our future collaborators must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of such clinical trials could occur at any stage of evaluation. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results.\nIn some cases, we utilize novel mechanisms of action to treat diseases that have not previously been addressed by antibody therapies. We or any of our future collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including the following:\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or any of our future collaborators may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nif serious adverse events are identified during clinical trials of any of our product candidates that are attributable to such product candidate, we or any of our future collaborators may need to abandon development of that product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we or any of our future collaborators anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than anticipated or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthird-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us or any of our future collaborators in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe or any of our future collaborators might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that our product candidates have unanticipated serious side-effects or other unexpected characteristics or that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators may not approve our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 proposed clinical development plans;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us, any of our future collaborators or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we, any of our future collaborators or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nIf we or any of our future collaborators are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those currently contemplated, if we or any of our future collaborators are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we or any of our future collaborators may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain regulatory approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory approval for indications that are not as broad as intended;\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nbe subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we or any of our future collaborators may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we or any of our future collaborators do, which would impair our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize our product candidates and harm our business and results of operations.\nThe development and commercialization of biologic products is subject to extensive regulation, and we may not obtain regulatory approvals for eptinezumab or any of our other product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, import, marketing and distribution and other possible activities relating to eptinezumab, ALD1910 and any other product candidate that we may develop in the future are subject to extensive regulation in the United States. Biologics, like eptinezumab, require the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA and such product candidates are not permitted to be marketed in the United States until approval from the FDA of a BLA for that product has been obtained. A BLA must be supported by extensive preclinical and clinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, sufficient to demonstrate the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of the applicable product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. On February 21, 2019, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for eptinezumab for the prevention of migraine. Prior to the submission of this BLA, we had never submitted an application for approval for any product. We have never obtained FDA approval for any product. This lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain FDA approval in a timely manner, if at all, for eptinezumab, ALD1910 and our future product candidates. The FDA may not accept our BLA for filing and instead issue a refusal-to-file letter or we could decide to withdraw our BLA if we determine that it will not be accepted for filing, which indicates that the BLA is not sufficiently complete so as to permit substantive review by the agency. Even if accepted for filing, the BLA may be subject to advisory committee input, which may be unfavorable to approval and may adversely impact our stock price. FDA may extend or be unable to meet its PDUFA goal date for the BLA, and may issue a complete response letter, rather than an approval.\nRegulatory approval of a BLA is not guaranteed, and the approval process is an expensive and uncertain process that may take several years. The FDA and foreign regulatory entities also have substantial discretion in the approval process. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for BLA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or the condition that the product candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. Data are subject to varying interpretation and the FDA may not agree that our clinical data support that eptinezumab is safe, pure and potent of the prevention of migraine. Despite the time and expense associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that require us to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or generate additional CMC data. The FDA and similar foreign authorities could delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including because they:\n\u2022\nmay not deem the product candidate to be adequately safe or effective;\n\u2022\nmay not find the data from preclinical studies, clinical trials or CMC data to be sufficient to support a claim of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nmay not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities associated with the product candidate;\n\u2022\nmay conclude that the long-term stability of the formulation of the drug product for which approval is being sought has not been sufficiently demonstrated;\n\u2022\nmay change approval policies or adopt new regulations; or\n\u2022\nmay not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission.\nTo market any biologics outside of the United States, we and any of our future collaborators must comply with the numerous and varying regulatory and compliance related requirements of other countries. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods, including obtaining reimbursement and pricing approval in select markets. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as additional, presently unanticipated, risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others, including the risk that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed.\nThe results of clinical trials conducted at sites outside the United States may not be accepted by the FDA and the results or clinical trials conducted at sites inside the United States may not be accepted by international regulatory authorities.\nWe have conducted, and may in the future choose to conduct, our clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well-designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The study population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical trials conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to label the product in the United States. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from our international clinical trials, or if international regulatory authorities do not accept the data from our U.S. clinical trials, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and could delay or permanently halt the development of a product candidate.\nWe face substantial competition, and others may discover, develop or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new therapeutic products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to eptinezumab and our other current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar products, which are expected to become available over the coming years. Many of our\ncompetitors are large pharmaceutical companies that have a greater ability to reduce prices for their competing drugs in an effort to maintain or gain market share and undermine the value proposition that drugs commercialized by us might otherwise be able to offer to payors, which could result in our product candidates being excluded from payor formularies. In addition, payors could require patients to have tried and failed our competitors\u2019 products before they provide reimbursement for our product candidates, which could shrink the market size for our product candidates.\nPotential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of these competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for our target indications.\nEptinezumab, if approved, will compete with three CGRP inhibiting therapies that received FDA approval in 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults, with data spanning both episodic and chronic migraine: Amgen\u2019s Aimovig (erenumab), Lilly\u2019s Emgality (galcanezumab) and Teva\u2019s Ajovy (fremanezumab). Each of these agents disrupts CGRP signaling either by binding to the CGRP receptor (Aimovig) or to the CGRP ligand (Ajovy and Emgality), and all are self-administered via subcutaneous injection either monthly (Aimovig, Emgality and Ajovy) or quarterly (Ajovy). While we believe that there is a significant opportunity for eptinezumab, our penetration could be limited by the availability of these therapies, which will have been on the market well in advance of eptinezumab if approved. Eptinezumab will also compete with beta blockers that are approved for prevention of episodic and chronic migraine such as propranolol, marketed by Wyeth, and other treatments such as topiramate, marketed by Johnson & Johnson, and sodium valproate, marketed by Divalproex. In addition, Botox, marketed by Allergan, is approved for the prevention of chronic migraine. We are also aware of several oral small-molecule CGRP inhibiting therapies currently in development that if approved could compete with eptinezumab, including Allergan\u2019s atogepant and Biohaven\u2019s rimegepant and BHV-3500. Patients also may be elect to use cheaper generic abortive medications such as triptans, which could limit eptinezumab market penetration in the migraine prevention marketplace.\nMany of our competitors, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies that compete directly with us, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient to administer or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. It is possible that our competitors might receive FDA or other regulatory approval for their products before us. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nDelays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials could increase our development costs and delay completion of the trials and delays in enrollment of patients in any of our future collaborators\u2019 clinical trials could delay completion of any of our future collaborators\u2019 trials.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for any of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, if the pace of enrollment is slower than we expect, the development costs for our product candidates may increase and the completion of our trials may be delayed or our trials could become too expensive to complete.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to enroll patients in any ongoing or planned clinical trial at a sufficient pace to complete the clinical trials within our projected time frame. Completing ongoing and future migraine trials will require us to continue to activate new clinical trial sites and to enroll patients at forecasted rates at both new and existing clinical trial sites. Our forecasts regarding the rates of clinical site activation and patient enrollment at those sites are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions based on experience with prior eptinezumab clinical trials. However, there can be no assurance that those forecasts will be accurate or that we will complete our ongoing and planned eptinezumab trials on schedule. During the initial months of our clinical trials, the number of clinical sites activated and the number of patients enrolled at each clinical site per month could be lower than we have forecasted and, as a result, we might need to make a number of adjustments to the clinical trial plan, including increasing the number of clinical trial sites. We can provide no assurance that those adjustments will be sufficient to enable us to complete the trials within our anticipated time frame. In addition, we may determine it necessary to increase the target number of patients to be enrolled in a clinical trial, which could extend the time necessary to complete such clinical trial. If we experience delays in enrollment, our ability to complete the trials could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct and support our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. Furthermore, some of the sites for our clinical trials are outside the United States. The performance of these sites may be adversely affected by various issues, including less advanced medical infrastructure, lack of familiarity with conducting clinical trials in accordance with U.S. standards, insufficient training of personnel, communication difficulties or change in local regulations. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the study. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of patients in clinical trials are protected. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, including our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our products.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future distributors could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenues.\nThe manufacture of our product candidates is complex and we may encounter difficulties in production. If we or any of our third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped.\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly-regulated and subject to multiple risks. The manufacture of biologics involves complex processes, including developing cells or cell systems to produce the biologic, growing large quantities of such cells and harvesting and purifying the biologic produced by them. As a result, the cost to manufacture biologics is generally far higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the biologics manufacturing process is less reliable and is difficult to reproduce. Manufacturing biologics, such as eptinezumab and other product candidates, is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We utilize third-party CMOs to produce eptinezumab using our proprietary yeast production technology.\nThe manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors. There are risks associated with scaling-up manufacturing to commercial scale including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of raw materials. Even if we or any of our future collaborators obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. If our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities of an approved product for commercialization, commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur yeast-based production system used for the manufacture of eptinezumab is a non-traditional antibody production platform and as we or any of our future collaborators produce product in commercial quantities, we or any such collaborators may experience unforeseen safety or other manufacturing issues which would adversely affect the commercialization of eptinezumab or any of our future product candidates.\nWe rely on third-party CMOs to manufacture and supply eptinezumab, including a single supplier of eptinezumab drug substance for the commercial launch of eptinezumab, if approved. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new suppliers or manufacturers and may also face delays in the development and commercialization of eptinezumab or other product candidates.\nWe currently do not own facilities for manufacturing our product candidates and we rely upon third-party CMOs to manufacture and supply drug product for clinical and commercial uses, including a single supplier of eptinezumab drug substance for the commercial launch of eptinezumab, if approved. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance with the FDA\u2019s current\ngood manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced cGMP requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements and foreign regulations. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to provide study drugs in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the trials completely.\nAll manufacturers of our product candidates must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have little control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nWe historically relied on a single smaller scale CMO to manufacture and provide us with clinical supplies of eptinezumab. We entered into an agreement with Sandoz GmbH, or Sandoz, effective May 2015, pursuant to which Sandoz will supply a certain guaranteed quantity of eptinezumab drug substance which we anticipate will be sufficient to support the commercial launch of eptinezumab and beyond, if approved. Our current and future agreements may not provide for an entire supply of product necessary for all anticipated clinical trials or for all potential commercial sales. If Sandoz or another of our CMOs terminates its agreement with us or otherwise becomes unable to fulfill its supply obligations, or if we and any future CMO cannot agree to the terms and conditions for provision of product necessary for our clinical and commercial supply needs, our clinical trials and commercialization efforts could be impaired until a qualified alternative supplier is identified, the manufacturing process is qualified and validated and we have agreed on the terms and conditions for such alternative supplier to supply product for us, which would have an adverse impact on our business and prospects.\nEptinezumab is a biologic and therefore requires complex production processes. Transferring the production process to a new manufacturer and scaling up the production process could be particularly difficult, time-consuming and expensive and may not yield comparable product. Although alternative sources of supply exist, the number of third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities necessary to manufacture eptinezumab and any other product candidates we may develop is limited, and may be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers. New suppliers of any product candidate would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us.\nEven if eptinezumab or any of our other product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf eptinezumab or any of our other product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side-effects;\n\u2022\nthe price we or any of our future collaborators charge for our products;\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these new therapies; and\n\u2022\nthe size and effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution support.\nIf our product candidates are approved and do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nWe currently have no sales or distribution personnel or infrastructure and only limited marketing capabilities. If we are unable to develop a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure on our own or through collaborations or other marketing arrangements, we will not be successful in commercializing eptinezumab or any of our future products.\nWe do not currently have sales or distribution capabilities and have no experience as an organization in the sale, marketing and distribution of therapeutic products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization, as well the corporate infrastructure to support such an organization, or outsource these functions to third parties. Assuming regulatory approval, we plan to focus our initial commercialization efforts on high-prescribing neurologists and headache centers in the United States employing a specialty sales force that we plan to establish. To maximize the potential commercial opportunity of eptinezumab while we focus on the U.S. specialty market, we may explore strategic arrangements that provide additional capabilities and infrastructure while improving access for physicians and patients.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we do not have another product to sell in the same specialty market. We also may not be successful entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively and could damage our reputation. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities or the supporting corporate infrastructure successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing eptinezumab or any other product candidates.\nIf we are able to commercialize eptinezumab or any other product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party reimbursement practices, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulations that govern pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutic products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we or any of our future collaborators might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our products, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval.\nOur and any of our future collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in significant part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments becomes available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary focus in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product that we or any of our future collaborators commercialize and, if coverage is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Further, one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, payors may only elect to coverage to a subset of competing drug products in a class. This has been observed with the three anti-CGRP therapies that received FDA approval in 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults, with certain payors only providing coverage for two of the three therapies. This practice could result in eptinezumab being denied coverage from one or more payors, if approved by the FDA.\nReimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we or any of our future collaborators obtain approval. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with products administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available or is available only\nto limited levels, we or any of our future collaborators may not be able to successfully commercialize any product that has been approved.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 costs and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Private third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our or any of our future collaborators\u2019 inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government funded and private payors for newly developed products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we or any of our future collaborators may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of patients from clinical trials or cancellation of trials;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently have $20 million in product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nMarketing approval of our product candidates in international markets will subject us to additional costs and a variety of risks associated with international operations.\nWe intend to pursue marketing approvals for our product candidates in international markets directly or with partners and will be subject to additional costs and additional risks related to international operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\nthe planned exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d); and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or disease and fail to capitalize on product candidates or diseases that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus our research programs and product candidates for a specific disease. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other diseases that may later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific diseases may not yield any commercially viable products.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential for a particular product candidate in the right disease, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and enhance our proprietary antibody platform to create a pipeline of product candidates and develop commercially successful products.\nWe have used our proprietary antibody platform for the selection of monoclonal antibodies to create eptinezumab, ALD1910 and other future product candidates that we are currently evaluating. Our platform has not yet, and may never, lead to approved or commercially successful products. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the future product candidates that we evaluate may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of any harmful side-effects that may emerge, limited efficacy or other characteristics that make it unlikely such product candidates will receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates using our proprietary antibody platform, we may not be able to obtain product or collaboration revenues in future periods, which would harm our business and prospects.\nIf any future collaborations for the development and commercialization of product candidates are not successful, our business may be harmed.\nWe may choose to enter into collaboration agreements with third parties with respect to our product candidates, including eptinezumab, for their development and commercialization in the United States or in international markets. We will have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that any of our future collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend in part on any such collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\n\u2022\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAny termination or disruption of any future collaboration could result in delayed development of product candidates, increased cost to develop product candidates or termination of development of a product candidate.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\nWe may evaluate various strategic transactions, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses. Any potential acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including increased operating expenses and cash requirements, assimilation of operations and products, retention of key employees, diversion of our management\u2019s attention and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships of the acquired entities. In addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our any of our future collaboration partners from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nAmong other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor any future collaboration partner is permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a BLA from the FDA. Prior to the submission of the our BLA for eptinezumab on February 21, 2019, we had never submitted an application for approval for any product. We have never obtained FDA approval for any product. Obtaining approval of BLA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including the following:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties and fines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nrefusal to accept or approve applications for marketing approval of new drugs or biologics or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseizure or detention of our products or import bans.\nPrior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our product candidates in the United States or abroad, we and any of our future collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we and any of our future collaboration partners believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering any of our product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side-effects, which could interrupt, delay or cause suspension of clinical trials of our product candidates and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications.\nRegulatory approval of BLA is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. In addition, the FDA typically conducts pre-approval review and inspections of manufacturing processes and facilities to ensure compliance with cGMP regulations and other requirements as well as audits select clinical trial sites to determine GCP compliance and data integrity.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022\nFDA officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA might not approve our or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 processes or facilities; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf any of our product candidates fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, our business will be harmed.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nOnce regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we or any of our future collaboration partners receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up trials to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping, among other things, for our products. In addition, manufacturers of our drug products are required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance\nas well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Furthermore, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our drug products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and other requirements. If we or a third party discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturer or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA and/or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including the following:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties and fines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseizure or detention of our products or import bans.\nAdditionally, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.\nThe regulatory requirements and policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted for which we may also be required to comply. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our future products and our business may suffer.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products in these jurisdictions.\nWe or a future collaboration partner may market eptinezumab and any future products in international markets. In order to market our future products in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. Specifically, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.\nBefore granting the MA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nWe have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities, and the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nIn the United States, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services, improve quality of care, and expand access to coverage. For example, one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, was enacted in 2010. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed two Executive Orders and other directives to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. We cannot know how any future healthcare reform legislation will impact our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, which triggered the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that went into effect on April 1, 2013, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as well as other legislative changes to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThere have been and likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care. For example, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nour ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital for our business.\nFurthermore, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to Institutional Review Boards for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate or suspend\nclinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nGiven the serious public health risks of high profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, preapproval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEven though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including those pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights, are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making false statements to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to annually report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which imposes requirements on certain types of entities and individuals regarding the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers;\n\u2022\nstate laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government;\n\u2022\nstate laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, marketing expenditures, or information related to drug pricing;\n\u2022\nstate and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and\n\u2022\nstate and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. In addition, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, integrity obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nEU Member States, Switzerland and other countries have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, European Union, or EU, member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the U.S., provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business. In addition, new regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business. In this regard, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to intellectual property license agreements with third parties. For example, we have a non-exclusive, royalty bearing license with Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH, or Teva GmbH, for its CGRP patent portfolio to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab in the United States and worldwide, excluding Japan and Korea. We also have a third-party royalty free license associated with the Keck Graduate Institute for our yeast-based proprietary manufacturing technology. We may enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that our future license agreements will impose, various diligence, royalty payment, milestone payment, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations or our other obligations in our license agreements, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we may not be able to develop and market any product or use any platform technology that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms or our not having sufficient intellectual property rights to operate our business. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products may be impaired if we are unable to obtain and maintain effective intellectual property rights for our proprietary antibody platform and product candidates.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to our proprietary antibody platform and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents or enforce the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated. Because certain intellectual property rights are shared between us and any of our future collaborators, it is possible that disputes may arise related to the distribution of those rights.\nWe have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. The standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, uses to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Consequently, we cannot be certain as to whether pending patent applications will be allowed; and if allowed, we cannot be certain as to the type and extent of patent claims that will be issued to us in the future. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unresolved. In recent years, patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nIn March 2013, the United States converted to a first-to-file patent system under the recently enacted America Invents Act. With this change, the United States patent system was brought into closer conformity with the patent systems of other countries, the vast majority of which operate as first-to-file patent systems. Under the former system, and assuming the other requirements for patentability were met, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. A number of our patents and patent applications are subject to the first-to-invent system because they originated prior to the March 2013 cutoff. Under the new United States system, and outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent, with certain exceptions. A number of our patents and patent applications are subject to the new first-to-file system in the United States because they originated after the March 2013 cutoff. The full effect of these changes remains unclear as the USPTO endeavors to implement various regulations concerning the new system. Furthermore, the courts have yet to address the vast majority of these provisions and the applicability of the America Invents Act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. We may become involved in opposition, interference, post-grant or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others, and the outcome of any proceedings are highly uncertain. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of future product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. The standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. As a result, we cannot predict with certainty how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Inequitable conduct is frequently raised as a defense during intellectual property litigation. It is believed that all parties involved in the prosecution of our patent applications have complied with their duties of disclosure in the course of prosecuting our patent applications, however, it is possible that legal claims to the contrary could be asserted if we were engaged in intellectual property litigation, and the results of any such legal claims are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation. If a court determines that any party involved in the prosecution of our patents failed to comply with their duty of disclosure, the subject patent would be unenforceable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could harm our business.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us, or other parties we have agreed to indemnify, based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Furthermore, since patent applications are published some time after filing, and because applications can take several years to issue, there may be pending third-party patent applications that are unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents.\nWe may initiate litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to patents held by others. Because of the inevitable uncertainty in intellectual property legal proceedings, any such proceedings, if initiated, may not ultimately be resolved in our favor regardless of our perception of the merits. If we lose such a proceeding, or are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights in any jurisdiction, we may not be to engage in commercialization and related activities for a product candidate for its intended use in such jurisdiction without obtaining a license from such third party. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including in the United States treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent, and attorneys\u2019 fees. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations.\nIn July 2014, we and Eli Lilly each filed an opposition to a European patent owned by Teva GmbH with claims directed to CGRP antagonist antibodies and use of such CGRP antagonist antibodies in human therapy for the prevention or treatment of headache such as migraine. In January 2018, we entered into a European patent settlement and global license agreement with Teva GmbH pursuant to which we received a non-exclusive license to Teva GmbH\u2019s CGRP patent portfolio, which includes the opposed European patent, to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab in the United States and worldwide, excluding Japan and Korea, and agreed to withdraw our opposition.\nWe may be unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, thus harming our business and competitive position.\nIn addition to our patented technology and products, we rely upon trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. However, it is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees, consultants or collaborators that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Furthermore, our trade secrets could be disclosed, misappropriated or otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Our trade secrets can be lost through their inadvertent or advertent disclosure to others. In addition, intellectual property laws in foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our trade secrets are disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers. Intellectual property litigation or proceedings could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Personnel\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and other key employees and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers and other key employees. The employment of our executive officers and other key employees is typically at-will and our executive officers and other key employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining other qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain critical personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by third parties and have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory affairs, sales and marketing and other capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nOver the next several years, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, sales and marketing and other functional areas, including finance, accounting and legal. For example, if eptinezumab is approved, we plan to build a specialty sales force targeting high-prescribing neurologists and headache centers in the United States. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we\ncould be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may be required to incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may divert resources away from our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, floods, hurricanes, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters is located in Washington and certain clinical sites for our product candidates, operations of our existing and future partners and suppliers are or will be located in Washington near major earthquake faults. The ultimate impact on us, our significant partners, suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings from time-to-time, which could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business we have been and in the future may become involved in various lawsuits, claims, proceedings and contractual disputes relating to the conduct of our business. For example, as described in Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, we recently terminated for breach a contract manufacturing agreement for the delivery of future services, and the vendor has disputed the termination. We have estimated that termination-related costs, if any, could range from $0 to $52 million, although the vendor has asserted the remaining amount owed under the contract is significantly higher than our estimated amount. This contract dispute, and any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or other disputes, are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual costs to be incurred relating to such disputes may be impacted by unknown factors. The outcome of litigation or other disputes is necessarily uncertain, and we could be forced to expend significant resources in the management or defense of, or negotiation related to, litigation or other disputes, and we may not prevail. Managing and defending against legal actions and disputes can be time-consuming for our management and detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities, which could result in delays of our clinical trials or our development and commercialization efforts. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with these and potential future litigations and disputes. Decisions adverse to our interests in any litigation or dispute could result in the payment of substantial amounts, which could be in excess of any amounts we have estimated or reserved in our financial statements, or could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to our product candidates, which may change from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our product candidates, should they receive approval, which may vary significantly;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success or failure of clinical trials for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of any development funding or milestone payments under any future collaboration agreements; and\n\u2022\nthe risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement policies with respect to our products candidates, if approved, and existing and potential future drugs that compete with our product candidates.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated operating results guidance we may provide.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses. Volatility in the market price and trading volume of our common stock could adversely impact the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and is likely to be volatile in the future. Since January 1, 2015, the reported sale price of our common stock has fluctuated between $8.60 and $54.90 per share. For example, on June 26, 2017, prior to our announcement of our PROMISE 1 data, the closing price of our common stock was $18.70 per share. Following the announcement of our PROMISE 1 data, the closing price of our common stock on June 27, 2017 was $13.48, and since that date the reported sale price of our common stock has been as low as $8.60 per share.\nThe stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe sales, growth and market share of competing anti-CGRP therapeutics;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nintroductions and announcements of future product candidates by us, any of our future collaborators, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our or our competitors\u2019 product candidates, clinical trials, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nthe success of our efforts to discover, acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our future collaborations, including but not limited to those with our sources of manufacturing supply and our future collaborators;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing disruptions;\n\u2022\nactual or potential litigation or commercial disputes;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions in the United States and abroad, including, for example, the impact of Brexit or similar events on global financial markets;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nthe other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nA decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of the Convertible Notes. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes to decline. This could cause the market price of our common stock and trading price of the Convertible Notes to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market could occur at any time. We may issue shares of our common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt-to-equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of options, or for other reasons. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock, could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities and could adversely affect the trading price of the Convertible Notes. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock or trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of our convertible preferred stock and the Convertible Notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had options and restricted stock awards outstanding that, if fully exercised or vested, as applicable, would result in the issuance of 11,010,336 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2018, there were also 1,238,727 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 1,707,656 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The authorized number of shares under both such benefit plans are subject to automatic annual increases in the number of shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on January 1 of each year through 2024. As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,450,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our 2018 Inducement Award Plan. All of the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to our equity compensation plans have been or will be registered for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act in the case of our affiliates.\nThe existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nMoreover, as of December 31, 2018, holders of an aggregate of up to approximately 3.7 million of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nIn addition, in connection with our January 2018 issuance of convertible preferred stock to certain institutional and other accredited investors affiliated with or managed by Redmile Group, LLC, collectively, Redmile, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Redmile. Under the registration rights agreement, we filed a prospectus supplement under our current registration statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-216199), and are required to file, if needed, one or more additional registration statements, as permissible and necessary, for the resale of the shares of our common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock and a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 75,000 shares of convertible preferred stock that we may be required to issue to Redmile.\nIn addition, in January 2019, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to commence an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering program, or the ATM program, under which we are permitted to offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having a maximum aggregate offering price of up to $100 million.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nComplying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies has increased and will increase our costs and the demands on management and could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq impose numerous requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Also, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these laws and regulations. These burdens may increase as new legislation is passed and implemented, including any new requirements that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may impose on public companies. These requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 subjects us to substantial accounting expense and to expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nFurthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these requirements effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nour board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control;\n\u2022\nour board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour stockholders may not act by written consent or call special stockholders\u2019 meetings; as a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions other than at annual stockholders\u2019 meetings or special stockholders\u2019 meetings called by the board of directors, the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nstockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u2022\nour board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock; the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Convertible Notes require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Convertible Notes to require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our investors.\nProvisions under Delaware law and Washington law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition to provisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are located in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain circumstances now or in the future. These provisions prohibit a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any stockholder constituting an \u201cacquiring person\u201d for a period of five years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cacquiring person.\u201d", "PERMNO": 14646, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ALDR"}
