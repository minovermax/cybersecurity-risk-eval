{"cik": "1606363", "company": "Green Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us, our business and an investment in our common stock as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, you could experience a partial or complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe conduct our operations almost exclusively in Texas which imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting Texas, including any downturn in the energy, technology or real estate sectors.\nWe conduct our operations almost exclusively in Texas and, as of December 31, 2014, the substantial majority of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in Texas. Likewise, as of such date, the substantial\nmajority of our secured loans were secured by collateral located in Texas. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in Texas significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, and any adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of non-performing assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. While Texas fared well through the Great Recession, if prolonged, the recent decline in oil prices may negatively impact economic conditions in these areas. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Texas, our existing or prospective borrowers or property values in our market areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically focused.\nIn addition, the economies in our target markets are highly dependent on the energy sector as well as the technology and real estate sectors. In particular, a further decline in the prices of crude oil or natural gas could adversely affect many of our customers. Any downturn or adverse development in the energy, technology or real estate sectors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the decline in oil prices.\nRecent decisions by certain members the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to maintain higher crude oil production levels have led to increased global oil supplies which has resulted in significant declines in market oil prices. Decreased market oil prices have compressed margins for many U.S. and Texas-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. As of December 31, 2014, our energy reserve exposure was 8.7% and our energy related service industry exposure was 5.2% of our total funded loans. Furthermore, energy production and related industries represent a large part of the economies in some of our primary markets. As of December 31, 2014, the price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $53 compared to approximately $98 as of December 31, 2013. While many of our customers have hedged their exposure to oil price changes in the near term, if oil prices remain at these low levels for an extended period, we could experience weaker energy loan demand and increased losses within our energy portfolio. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Texas. Accordingly, a prolonged period of low oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.\nOur strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions. We may not be able to execute on aspects of our growth strategy to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, we may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of acquisitions. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced portfolio bankers, which could adversely affect our growth. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to adapt our credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to implement one or more aspects of our strategy, we may be unable to maintain our historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nDifficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected the banking industry and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain conditions nationally and locally in our industry and markets. Although economic conditions have improved in recent years, financial institutions continue to be affected by volatility in the real estate market in some parts of the country and uncertain regulatory and interest rate conditions. We retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets in Texas and are affected by these events.\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio is made more complex by uncertain market and economic conditions. Another national economic recession or deterioration of conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences:\n\u2022increases in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022increases in non-performing assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022decreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position; and\n\u2022decreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability.\nWhile economic conditions in Texas and the U.S. continue to show signs of recovery, there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue to improve. Although real estate markets have stabilized in portions of the U.S., a resumption of declines in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job losses, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a strategy that includes acquisitions. An acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022finding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022attracting funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances;\n\u2022maintaining asset quality;\n\u2022retaining customers and key personnel, including bankers;\n\u2022obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022conducting adequate due diligence and managing known and unknown risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022integrating acquired businesses; and\n\u2022maintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition candidates that fit our strategy and standards. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized. Acquisitions will be subject to regulatory approvals, and we may be unable to obtain such approvals. Acquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, and acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire and to realize our attempts to eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that they would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition of a financial service company, and the carrying amount of any goodwill that we acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to retain our portfolio bankers and recruit additional successful portfolio bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to retain and grow our loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and relationship management skills of our portfolio bankers. If we were to lose the services of any of our portfolio bankers, including any successful bankers employed by acquired businesses, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. Our growth strategy also relies on our ability to attract and retain profitable portfolio bankers and on the ability of our existing portfolio bankers to achieve what we believe to be their full capacity in terms of customer relationships and profitability. We may face difficulties in recruiting and retaining portfolio bankers of our desired caliber, including as a result of competition from other financial institutions. In particular, many of our competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources, and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Additionally, we may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before we are able to determine whether a new portfolio banker will be profitable or effective. If we are unable to attract and retain successful portfolio bankers, or if our portfolio\nbankers fail to meet our expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, we may be unable to execute our business strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the Texas markets in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans secured by receivables, inventory, equipment or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAs of December 31, 2014, $788.7 million, or 43.8% of our total loans, was comprised of commercial and industrial loans to businesses collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and generally backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. These commercial and industrial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial and industrial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets, resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial real estate and real estate construction loan portfolios expose us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2014, $502.6 million, or 27.9% of our total loans, was comprised of commercial real estate loans (including owner occupied commercial real estate loans) and $240.7 million, or 13.4% of our total loans, was comprised of real estate construction loans. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate. Additionally, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConstruction loans involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are secured by a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. It can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project, and construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2014, $1.0 billion, or 55.6% of our total loans, was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could increase\nthe credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Real estate values in many Texas markets have experienced periods of fluctuation over the last five years. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that would adversely affect credit quality, financial condition and results of operation. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on our analysis of our portfolio and market environment. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us. Our allowance for loan losses consists of a general component based upon probable but unidentified losses inherent in the portfolio and a specific component based on individual loans that are considered impaired. The general component is based on various factors including our historical loss experience, historical loss experience for peer banks, growth trends, loan concentrations, migration trends between internal loan risk ratings, current economic conditions and other qualitative factors. The specific component of the allowance for loan losses is calculated based on a review of individual loans considered impaired. The analysis of impaired losses may be based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective loan rate or an observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral on collateral dependent loans. In determining the collectability of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. The amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic, operating or other conditions beyond our control, and any such differences may be material. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for loan losses.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses was 0.87% of our total loans. Loans acquired are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have previously experienced. We may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or requirements by our banking regulators. In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to non-accrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to recognize future charge-offs. These adjustments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe relatively unseasoned nature of a significant portion of our loan portfolio may expose us to increased credit risks.\nOur loan portfolio has grown to $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2014, from $555.9 million as of December 31, 2010. A significant portion of this increase is the result of new loans originated by us during that period. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these recently originated loans because our relatively limited experience with such loans does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to judge future collectability. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers, which may increase our risk of loss.\nWe have extended significant amounts of credit to a limited number of borrowers, and at December 31, 2014, the aggregate amount of loans to our 10 and 25 largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to approximately $165.8 million, or 9.2% of total loans and $363.9 million, or 20.1% of total loans, respectively. At such date, none of these loans were nonperforming loans. A high amount of credit extended to a limited number of borrowers increases the risk in our loan portfolio. In the event that one or more of these borrowers is not able to make payments of interest and principal in respect of such loans, the potential loss to us is more likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of our investment securities, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Dallas Fed and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the \u201cFHLB\u201d). We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in our target markets or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, could be adversely affected.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or contract our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income, or the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan portfolio and our overall results. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nEnsuring that we have adequate disclosure controls and procedures, including internal controls over financial reporting, in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is costly and time-consuming and needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Although we are currently required to provide an auditor attestation as to our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with applicable bank regulatory standards, we are in the process of documenting, reviewing and, if appropriate, improving our internal controls and procedures in anticipation of being subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and, when we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective due to our failure to cure any identified material weakness or otherwise. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may not conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. No material weaknesses were identified in connection with our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with applicable bank regulatory standards for the year ended December 31, 2014. Going forward, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or it may interpret the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, during the course of the evaluation, documentation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any such deficiencies may also subject us to adverse regulatory consequences in connection with our required submission of audited financial statements and an auditor attestation as to our internal control over financial reporting to certain of our regulators. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could impact our business.\nWe conduct our operations primarily in Texas. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within our market areas. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non-bank lenders and certain other non-financial entities, such as retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing or deposit terms than we can. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices, or otherwise solicit deposits, in our market areas. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin, fee income and profitability. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nWe also face competition for acquisition opportunities in connection with the implementation of our acquisition strategy. Because there are a limited number of acquisition opportunities in our target markets, we face competition from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater financial, human, technical and other resources than we do. Our ability to\ncompete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial resources to fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have and the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nWhile we attempt to invest a significant percentage of our assets in loans (our loan to deposit ratio was 97.5% as of December 31, 2014), we invest a percentage of our total assets (10.8% as of December 31, 2014) in investment securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2014, the book value of our securities portfolio was $238.3 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of our executive officers or other key employees could impair our relationship with our customers and adversely affect our business.\nOur success is dependent upon the continued service and skills of our executive management team. Our goals, strategies and marketing efforts are closely tied to the banking philosophy and strengths of our executive management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of services of any of these key personnel could have a negative impact on our business because of their skills, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. While we have employment agreements with our executive officers, we cannot guarantee that these executive officers or key employees will continue to be employed with us in the future.\nIf the goodwill that we have recorded or may record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net assets we acquire in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nOur goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. Under the first step, the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill. If step one indicates a potential impairment, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2014, our goodwill totaled $30.1 million. While we have not recorded any impairment charges since we initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of our existing goodwill, or goodwill we may acquire in the future, will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use, including the systems and infrastructure of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer\nequipment, and the information stored therein, against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes breakdowns or disruptions in our general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, including enforcement action that could restrict our operations, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. While we maintain specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. In addition, cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some of which may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, have and intend to continue to implement security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will entirely mitigate these risks. In addition, advances in computer capabilities could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in us not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points. These technological advances increase cybersecurity risk. While we maintain programs intended to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity risk, there is no assurance that unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information will not occur. The financial, reputational and regulatory impact of unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information could be significant\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive certain third-party services including, but not limited to, core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, our online banking services, deposit processing and other processing services. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to provide services. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by security breaches at third-parties.\nOur customers interact with their own and other third party systems, which pose operational risks to us. We may be adversely affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who maintain data relating to our customers that involve the theft of customer data, including the theft of customers' debit card, wire transfer and other identifying and/or access information used to make purchases or payments at such retailers and to other third parties. Despite third-party security risks that are beyond our control, we offers our customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit cards in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. Offering such protection to customers exposes us to significant expenses and potential losses related to reimbursing our customers for fraud losses, reissuing the compromised cards and increased monitoring for suspicious activity. In the event of a data breach at one or more retailers of considerable magnitude, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect us from material losses associated with these risks, including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third-party, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to locate, and it is often difficult to recover any of the resulting monetary losses we may suffer.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the foreclosure on real estate assets securing our loan portfolio.\nHazardous or toxic substances or other environmental hazards may be located on the properties that secure our loans. If we acquire such properties as a result of foreclosure or otherwise, we could become subject to various environmental liabilities. For example, we could be held liable for the cost of cleaning up or otherwise addressing contamination at or from these properties. We could also be held liable to a governmental entity or third-party for property damage, personal injury or other claims relating to any environmental contamination at or from these properties. In addition, we own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks. Although we have policies and procedures that are designed to mitigate certain environmental risks, we may not detect all environmental hazards associated with these properties. If we ever became subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Regulation\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act may have a material effect on our operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, and the process of implementation is ongoing. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes on many industries, including ours. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will ultimately be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear. The legal and regulatory changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, require the development of new compliance infrastructure, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and\nresources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a more detailed description of the Dodd-Frank Act, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision-The Dodd-Frank Act.\u201d\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d), and the overall financial stability of the United States, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in identifying, managing or mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nWe have implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, financial, interest rate, legal and regulatory, compliance, strategic, reputation, fiduciary and general economic risks. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies, which involves management assumptions and judgment. There is no assurance that this risk management framework will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately identify, manage or mitigate any risk or loss to us. If this framework is not effective, we may be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences and could suffer unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nFederal banking agencies, including the OCC and Federal Reserve, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in the Company\u2019s and/or the Bank\u2019s capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Company, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors, and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe intend to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and, potentially, other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management, and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act (the \u201cCRA\u201d)) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may\nnot be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we plan to continue de novo branching as a part of our organic growth strategy. De novo branching and any acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo branches may impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nFinancial institutions, such as the Bank, face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cU.S. Justice Department\u201d), Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by OFAC.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have dedicated significant resources to our anti-money laundering program. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plans, including acquisitions and de novo branching.\nWe are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Justice Department and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe FDIC\u2019s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could adversely affect our earnings.\nAs a result of economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional financial institution failures that affect the DIF, we may be required to pay FDIC premiums higher than current levels. Our FDIC insurance related costs were $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, compared with $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the final Basel III Capital Rules (as defined below) that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel III Capital Rules will apply to banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank.\nAs a result of the enactment of the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and the Bank will become subject to increased required capital levels. The Basel III Capital Rules become effective as applied to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Adequacy-US Implementation of Basel III.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve, which examines the Company, requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nSuch a capital injection may be required at a time when our resources are limited and we may be required to borrow the funds to make the required capital injection. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, broker-dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or cover the derivative exposure due. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the regulations and policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although we cannot determine the effects of such policies on us at this time, such policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, innovations or new programs and services;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our stock;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022general economic conditions and overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022changes in business, legal or regulatory conditions, or other developments affecting participants in our industry, and publicity regarding our business or any of our significant customers or competitors;\n\u2022changes in governmental monetary policies, including the policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock by us, directors, executives and significant shareholders; and\n\u2022changes in economic conditions in and political conditions affecting our target markets, including fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas.\nIn particular, the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and cause the value of your investment to decline. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock over the short, medium or long term, regardless of our actual performance. If the market price of our common stock reaches an elevated level, it may materially and rapidly decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were to be involved in a class action lawsuit, it could divert the attention of senior management and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that are not incurred by private companies, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the PCAOB and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, we are required to:\n\u2022prepare and distribute periodic reports, proxy statements and other shareholder communications in compliance with the federal securities laws and rules;\n\u2022expand the roles and duties of our board of directors and committees thereof;\n\u2022maintain an internal audit function;\n\u2022institute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance procedures;\n\u2022involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above;\n\u2022enhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022establish new internal policies, including those relating to trading in our securities and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022retain additional personnel;\n\u2022comply with the NASDAQ Global Select Market listing standards; and\n\u2022comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe expect these rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which have created uncertainty for public companies, to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These increased costs may require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, either absolutely or relative to our competitors, our stock price could decline significantly.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities. Our Restated Certificate of Formation (with Amendments) (\u201ccertificate of formation\u201d) authorizes us to issue 90,000,000 shares of common stock, 26,170,949 of which was outstanding as of December 31, 2014.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments and pursuant to compensation and incentive plans. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition or under a compensation or incentive plan), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of our securities.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of formation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions allow us to, among other things, present only two years of audited financial statements and discuss only our results of operations for two years in related Management\u2019s Discussions and Analyses; to not provide an auditor attestation of our internal control over financial reporting; to choose not to comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and our audited financial statements; to provide reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, which means we do not have to include a compensation discussion and analysis and certain other disclosure regarding our executive compensation; and to not seek a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of these reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as we are an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million). Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate\nour common stock because we may rely on one or more of these exemptions, and, as a result, investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC, so you could lose some or all of your investment.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nWe currently have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, so you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company, which is limited by applicable laws and banking regulations, and may in the future be restricted by the terms of any debt or preferred securities we may incur or issue. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. See \u201cDividend Policy.\u201d\nOur primary tangible asset is the Bank. As such, we depend upon the Bank for cash distributions (through dividends on the Bank\u2019s stock) that we use to pay our operating expenses and satisfy our obligations (including debt obligations). There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, we will not be able to satisfy our obligations. Federal statutes and regulations restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to the Company. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, federal banking authorities have the ability to restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends through supervisory action. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions.\u201d\nOur corporate organizational documents and the provisions of Texas law to which we are subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of the Company that you may favor.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of formation and bylaws have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022staggered terms for directors;\n\u2022a provision that directors cannot be removed except for cause;\n\u2022a provision that any special meeting of our shareholders may be called only by a majority of the board of directors, the Chairman or a holder or group of holders of at least a majority of our shares entitled to vote at the meeting;\n\u2022a provision that requires the vote of two-thirds of the shares outstanding for major corporate actions, such as an amendment to the Company\u2019s certificate of formation or bylaws or the approval of a merger; and\n\u2022a provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered only at an annual or special meeting of shareholders.\nOur certificate of formation provides for non-cumulative voting for directors and authorizes the board of directors to issue shares of its preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The issuance of our preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from acquiring, a controlling interest in us. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of the Company. Our certificate of formation prohibits shareholder action by less than unanimous written consent. See \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d\nFurthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d), the Change in Bank Control Act and the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. These\nlaws could delay or prevent an acquisition. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Notice and Approval Requirements Related to Control.\u201d\nShareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us, which could impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nWe are a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution or a company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution, such as a bank holding company. These laws include the BHC Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. The determination whether an investor \u201ccontrols\u201d a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment.\nAs a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party (i) owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock of the bank or other company, (ii) controls the election of a majority of the directors of the bank or other company or (iii) has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or other company. In addition, subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock. Ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. \u201cActing in concert\u201d generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty.\nAny shareholder that is deemed to \u201ccontrol\u201d us for regulatory purposes would become subject to notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements.\nWe have several large non-controlling shareholders, and such shareholders may independently vote their shares in a manner that you may not consider to be consistent with your best interest or the best interest of our shareholders as a whole.\nInvestment funds affiliated with Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, LLC, Harvest Partners, LP and Pine Brook Road Partners, LLC each currently beneficially own approximately 19.1% of our outstanding common stock. Each of these shareholders is currently subject to passivity commitments made to the Federal Reserve in connection with their investment in us in which they agreed not to, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, among other things, exercise or attempt to exercise a controlling influence over our management or policies, have or seek to have more than one representative serve on our board of directors or permit any representative to serve as the chairman of our board of directors or any committee thereof. However, subject to those commitments, each of these shareholders will continue to have the ability to independently vote a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock on all matters put to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of our board of directors and certain other significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or acquisition transaction. On any such matter, the interests of any one of these shareholders may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock and any such difference in interests may result in that shareholder voting its shares in a manner inconsistent with the interest of other shareholders.\nIn addition, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with each of these shareholders that provides for the rights of such shareholders to nominate individuals for election to our board of directors. Furthermore, it is possible that one or more of these shareholders may choose to sell or otherwise dispose of all or a significant portion of the remaining shares they hold, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the value of your investment in us may decrease.", "PERMNO": 14870, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "GNBC"}
