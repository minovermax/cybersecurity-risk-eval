RISK FACTORS\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe are a medical device company with a limited operating history. We are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. Substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses and an accumulated deficit. We continue to incur research and development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $37.7 million, and our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2014 was $135.9 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash received from sales of our products, will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through December 31, 2015.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will likely increase as we continue to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. If our products fail in development or do not gain regulatory clearance or approval, or if our products do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. We anticipate that, if needed, we will seek capital from other sources, such as equity offerings. Absent a significant increase in revenue or additional equity or debt financing, we may not be able to sustain our ability to continue as a going concern. We have filed shelf registration statements which have been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). As of December 31, 2014, we had $143.6 million available for future financings. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe net proceeds of recent financings, including the public offering of our common stock completed in April 2014, will not be sufficient to support development of our products and product candidates and provide us with the necessary resources to commercialize these products and product candidates. While we are currently focused on our SurgiBot System product in development, we intend to advance multiple additional products through clinical and pre-clinical development in the future. We will likely need to raise substantial additional capital in order to continue our operations and achieve our business\u2019 objectives.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe costs of our SurgiBot System development activities;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory clearances and approvals;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with establishing a sales force and commercialization capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nour need to expand our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress and cost of future clinical testing;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, products and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe economic and other terms and timing of our existing licensing arrangement and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future;\n\u2022\nour need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, medical and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems, quality systems and information technology systems; and\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio.\nUntil we generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which may never occur, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic collaborations. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical studies or research and development programs. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution; and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that limit our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our financial resources and our ability to operate our business.\nWe are party to, and jointly and severally liable with our subsidiaries for, $10.0 million of outstanding debt of a Loan and Security Agreement, originally dated January 17, 2012, as amended, with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Oxford Finance LLC (Oxford), as Lenders, which agreement was amended and restated on September 26, 2014 (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement). Under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the Lenders have agreed to make certain term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000,000, with the first tranche adding to the outstanding principal amount of the then existing term loan borrowed by the Company from the Lenders under the original loan agreement for an aggregate of $10,000,000 in borrowings as of September 26, 2014. Two additional tranches are to be made available as follows. The second tranche of $5,000,000 will be available at any time prior to one year after the closing date when the Company files a 510(k) application for its SurgiBot System, and completes an offering of its equity securities at or above $35 million. The third tranche of $10,000,000, will be made available to the Company at any time prior to two years after the closing date upon recognition of at least $10,000,000 of trailing six-month revenues from the SurgiBot System and SurgiBot-related products. The Company is entitled to make interest-only payments for 12 months from the closing date, which interest-only period is extended to 18 months if the Company receives 510(k) clearance for its SurgiBot System at any time before October 31, 2015. The maturity date of the Term Loans is April 1, 2018 without the interest-only extension and October 1, 2018 with the interest-only extension. Our resulting substantial level of indebtedness and other financial obligations increase the possibility that we may be unable to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due in respect of, our indebtedness.\nFurther, under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital requirements, product development activities, debt service requirements, and general corporate or other purposes. These restrictive covenants include, without limitation, restrictions on our ability to: (1) change the nature of our business; (2) incur additional indebtedness; (3) incur liens; (4) make certain investments; (5) make certain dispositions of assets; (6) merge, dissolve, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and (7) enter into transactions with affiliates.\nIf we breach any of these restrictive covenants or are unable to pay our indebtedness under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement when due, this could result in a default under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. In such event, SVB and/or Oxford, as the case may be, may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, to be immediately due and payable. Any such occurrence would have an immediate and materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement is secured by a security interest in all assets of the Company and its current and future subsidiaries, including a security interest in intellectual property proceeds, but excluding a current security interest in intellectual property.\nSome of our technologies are in an early stage of development and not yet proven. Further, our related product research and development activities may not lead to our technologies and products being commercially viable.\nWe are engaged in the research and development of minimally invasive surgical devices, robotic surgical devices, and medical devices that manipulate tissues for the treatment of certain intraperitoneal abnormalities. The effectiveness of our technologies is not well known in, or may not be accepted generally by, the clinical medical community. Further, our products are prone to the risks of failure inherent in medical device product development. In particular, any of our products may fail to show desired efficacy and safety traits. A number of companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results at earlier points. The occurrence of any such events would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe results of previous clinical experience with our devices and devices similar to those that we are developing may not be indicative of future results and may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nPositive results from limited in vivo and ex vivo animal trials and other early development work we have conducted or early clinical experience with the test articles or with similar devices should not be relied upon as evidence that later-stage clinical experience will be successful.\nFurther, our products may not be cleared or approved, as the case may be, even if the clinical data are satisfactory and support, in our view, clearance or approval. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of the clinical data. Any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the clearance or approval of a product even after reviewing and providing comment on a protocol for a pivotal clinical trial that has the potential to result in FDA approval. These regulatory authorities may also clear or approve a product for fewer or more limited uses than we request. In addition, the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve or clear the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our products.\nWe are highly dependent on the success of the SurgiBot System, and we cannot give any assurance that it will receive regulatory clearance or that it or future products will be successfully commercialized.\nWe are highly dependent on the success of our products, especially the SurgiBot System. We cannot give any assurance that the FDA will grant regulatory clearance for the SurgiBot System, or will not require the more burdensome PMA submission and approval, nor can we give any assurance that the SurgiBot System or any of our other products will be successfully commercialized, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the potential introduction by our competitors of more clinically effective or cost-effective alternatives, or failure in our sales and marketing efforts. Any failure to obtain clearance or approval of our products or to successfully commercialize them would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIf we cannot achieve sufficient margins for our SurgiBot System, we may not be able to grow our revenues sufficiently to sustain our business.\nThe commercial viability of our SurgiBot System is a significant focus of our product development efforts. Competition in our industry is intense and we need to provide a commercially sustainable product. Although we expect our initial gross margins to be lower as we ramp up manufacturing, we need to produce a product with sufficient gross margins. Additionally, our SurgiBot System is designed with reusable and limited-life components, and we may not be able to meet reusability targets for applicable components at launch. If we are not successful, our revenue growth may be slower than expected and it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our products and future products, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many medical device companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery. We are currently developing and commercializing medical devices that will compete with other medical devices that currently exist or are being developed. Products we may develop in the future are also likely to face competition from other medical devices and therapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and product development resources than we do. Large medical device companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals for medical devices. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do. Some of the medical device companies we expect to compete with include Applied Medical, Medtronic plc, Intuitive Surgical, Johnson & Johnson, and a number of minimally invasive surgical device, robotic surgical device manufacturers and providers of products and therapies that are designed to reduce the need for or attractiveness of surgical intervention. In addition, many other universities and private and public research institutions are or may become active in research involving surgical devices for minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy, safety and reliability of our products;\n\u2022\nthe speed at which we develop our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize and market any of our products that may receive regulatory clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our products in relation to alternative devices;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nwhether our competitors substantially reduce the cost of ownership of an alternative device;\n\u2022\nour ability to protect and defend intellectual property rights related to our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to have our partners manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any approved products to the market;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors for the procedures in which our products are used;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\nacceptance of future products by physicians and other health care providers.\nIf our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, easier to use or less expensive than our products or future products, or that reach the market sooner than our products, we may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change. It may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or products obsolete or less competitive.\nOur product development activities could be delayed or stopped.\nWe do not know whether our current product development activities will result in products that meet necessary standards and performance criteria and whether the development will be completed on schedule. Delays could occur based on a number of issues that could arise. For example, should clinical trials be required, the commencement of our planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of the product for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nlimited number of, and competition for, suitable patients that meet the protocol\u2019s inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria;\n\u2022\nlimited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials, and delay or failure to obtain FDA approval, if necessary, to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nrequirements to provide the medical device required in our clinical trial at cost, which may require significant expenditures that we are unable or unwilling to make;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or investigators; and\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain IRB approval or renewal to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective or accruing site, respectively.\nThe completion of our clinical trials, if required, could also be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nlack of efficacy evidenced during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u2022\nfailure of patients to complete the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ntermination of our clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols or allocate sufficient resources to complete our clinical trials; and\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment.\nIn addition other issues, such as the need to investigate third party patents and potential infringement matters, although not currently an issue, could arise thereby delaying our development efforts.\nAny failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our products could materially harm our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products.\nCertain of our future products, such as the SurgiBot System, may require the approval of a PMA. Initiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support a PMA application, and additional safety and efficacy data beyond that typically required for a 510(k) clearance, can be time consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials. Conducting successful clinical studies requires the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators and support staff, proximity of patients to clinical sites, patient ability to meet the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive products. In addition, patients participating in clinical trials may die before completion of the trial or suffer adverse medical events unrelated to investigational products.\nSufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support future product candidates or claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nIn the future, we may need to conduct clinical trials to support approval of new products, and any future clinical trial activities that we undertake will be subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. Clinical studies intended to support a 510(k) or PMA must be conducted in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Good Clinical Practice regulations and similar requirements in foreign jurisdictions. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities and Notified Bodies will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of associated product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize products requiring submission of clinical data. It is also possible that patients enrolled in a clinical trial will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s safety profile, which could cause us to delay or abandon development of such product.\nThe regulatory approval and clearance processes are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our collaboration partners from obtaining approvals or clearances, as the case may be, for the commercialization of some or all of our products.\nThe product development and design, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, clearance, selling, marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our products in the United States until we receive a clearance letter under the 510(k) process or approval of a PMA from the FDA, depending on the nature of the device. While we believe we understand, from our discussions with the FDA, the regulatory pathway for our SurgiBot System, we cannot be certain of the regulatory pathway we will need to follow until we file for 510(k) clearance. Obtaining approval of any PMA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. While the FDA normally reviews a premarket notification in 90 days, there is no guarantee that our future products will qualify for this more expeditious regulatory process, which is reserved for Class I and II devices, nor is there any assurance, even if a device is reviewed under the 510(k) premarket notification process, that the FDA will review it expeditiously or determine that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed non-PMA device. In the past the Company has been successful in receiving 510(k) clearance within the 90 day review period, but it can take longer (six to eighteen months) to obtain 510(k) clearance for a Class II device. If the FDA fails to provide clearance for a product candidate, such as the SurgiBot System, then we cannot market the device. In lieu of acting on a premarket notification, the FDA may seek additional information or additional data which would further delay our ability to market the product.\nRegulatory approval of a PMA, PMA supplement or clearance pursuant to a 510(k) premarket notification is not guaranteed, and the approval or clearance process, as the case may be, is expensive, uncertain and may, especially in the case of the PMA application, take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the medical device clearance process or approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional development, standardized testing, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The number of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA clearance or approval varies depending on the medical device candidate, the disease or condition that the medical device candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular medical device candidate. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a medical device candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\na medical device candidate may not be deemed safe or effective, in the case of a PMA application;\n\u2022\na medical device candidate may not be deemed to be substantially equivalent to a device lawfully marketed either as a grandfathered device or one that was cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process;\n\u2022\na medical device candidate may not be deemed to be in conformance with applicable standards and regulations;\n\u2022\nFDA or other regulatory officials may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA might not approve our processes or facilities or those of any of our third-party manufacturers for our Class III PMA devices;\n\u2022\nother non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve our processes or facilities or those of any of our third-party manufacturers, thereby restricting export; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change clearance or approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nOnce our products are cleared or approved, modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances, premarket approvals or new or amended CE Certificates of Conformity, and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances, approvals or the relevant CE Certificates of Conformity are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review such determinations. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations for any future changes, or prior changes to previously marketed products, as the case may be, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified products until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurthermore, the FDA\u2019s ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. In July and December 2011, respectively, the FDA issued draft guidance documents addressing when to submit a new 510(k) due to modifications to 510(k) cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence. The July 2011 draft guidance document was ultimately withdrawn as the result of the FDASIA, and as a result, the FDA\u2019s original guidance document regarding 510(k) modifications, which dates back to 1997, remains in place. It is uncertain when the FDA will seek to issue new guidance on product modifications. Any efforts to do so could result in a more rigorous review process and make it more difficult to obtain clearance for device modifications.\nEven if we obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products, the terms thereof and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate anticipated revenues.\nOnce regulatory clearance or approval has been granted, the cleared or approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. Any cleared or approved product may be promoted only for its indicated uses. In addition, if the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities clear or approve any of our products, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. We and the manufacturers of our products are also required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which includes requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation as well as other quality system requirements and regulations from non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Further, regulatory agencies must approve our manufacturing facilities for Class III devices before they can be used to manufacture our products, and all manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspection. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, either before or after clearance or approval, or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nadverse inspectional observations (Form 483), warning letters, non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties or fines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nrefusal to clear or approve pending applications or premarket notifications; and\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions.\nAny of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nIn addition, the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change their policies and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory clearance or approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we would likely not be permitted to market our future products and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nEven after clearance or approval for our products is obtained, we are subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct post-market studies. These studies can be very expensive and time-consuming to conduct. Failure to complete such studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of clearance or approval and the recall or withdrawal of the product, which could prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States. The FDA has broad enforcement powers, and any regulatory enforcement actions or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some surgeons from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our products.\nWe are also required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, installation and servicing of our marketed products. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. In addition, in the future, regulatory authorities and/or customers may require specific packaging of sterile products, which could increase our costs and the price of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all firm-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to the FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations. Even though we are currently not marketing a number of our cleared products, such as the SPIDER, because these products are still in the marketplace, we are required to handle complaints and submit MDRs for any events meeting the reportability requirements.\nAll manufacturers bringing medical devices to market in the European Economic Area (EEA) are legally bound to report any incident that led or might have led to the death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person, and which the manufacturer\u2019s device is suspected to have caused, to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In such case, the manufacturer must file an initial report with the relevant competent authority, which would be followed by further evaluation or investigation of the incident and a final report indicating whether further action is required.\nAny adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Adverse events involving our products have been reported to us in the past, and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur in the future. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nA recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities such as the competent authorities of the EEA countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nAny future recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nU.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, the FDA recently issued guidance documents intended to explain the procedures and criteria the FDA will use in assessing whether a 510(k) submission meets a minimum threshold of acceptability and should be accepted for review. Under the \u201cRefuse to Accept\u201d guidance, the FDA conducts an early review against specific acceptance criteria to inform 510(k) submitters if the submission is administratively complete, or if not, to identify the missing element(s). Submitters are given the opportunity to provide the FDA with the identified information, but if the information is not provided within a defined time, the submission will not be accepted for FDA review.\nAny change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur business activities are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nCurrent legislation and future legislative or regulatory reform of the health care system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there to continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that, if approved, could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. While many of the proposed policy changes require congressional approval to implement, we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third-party payor programs to health care providers will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement under these programs. Any changes that lower reimbursement rates under Medicare, Medicaid or private payor programs could negatively affect our business.\nTo the extent that any of our products are deemed to be durable medical equipment (DME), they may be subject to distribution under Medicare\u2019s Competitive Acquisition regulations, which could adversely affect the amount that we can seek from payors. Non-DME devices used in surgical procedures are normally paid directly by the hospital or health care provider and not reimbursed separately by third-party payors. As a result, these types of devices are subject to intense price competition that can place a small manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage as hospitals and health care providers attempt to negotiate lower prices for products such as the ones we develop and sell.\nMost significantly, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Reconciliation Act, and, with the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation). The constitutionality of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation was confirmed on June 28, 2012 by the Supreme Court of the United States. Specifically, the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate included changes regarding the extension of medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage. Thus, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation has changed the existing state of the health care system by expanding coverage through voluntary state Medicaid expansion, attracting previously uninsured persons through the new health care insurance exchanges and by modifying the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices. These structural changes could entail modifications to the existing system of third-party payors and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, or some combination of both, as well as other changes.\nBeyond coverage and reimbursement changes, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation subjects manufacturers of medical devices to an excise tax of 2.3% on certain U.S. sales of medical devices beginning in January 2013. Although there are current bills in Congress to repeal this excise tax, it remains current law. This excise tax will likely increase our expenses in the future.\nFurther, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Open Payments Act (formerly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain payments or \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. We provided our first reports under the Open Payments Act to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, during 2014 and the first public disclosure of the Open Payments data by CMS occurred in September 2014. The failure to report appropriate data accurately, timely, and completely could subject us to significant financial penalties. Other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more may enact similar legislation.\nRegulations under the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation have been, and are expected to continue to be, drafted, released and finalized throughout the next several years. The full impact of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, as well as laws and other reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nFinally, we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business. Any cost containment measures or other health care system reforms that are adopted could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our existing and future products successfully.\nEven if we receive regulatory clearance or approval to market our products, the market may not be receptive to our products, which could undermine our financial viability.\nEven if our products obtain regulatory clearance or approval, resulting products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and/or the medical community. To date, we have experienced minimal sales of the SPIDER System and AMID HFD stapler (both products were discontinued in 2014) and have not made any sales of the SurgiBot System. We believe that the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\nsafety and efficacy of our products;\n\u2022\nphysician training in the use of our products;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\npotential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nstrength of marketing and distribution support; and\n\u2022\nprice of our future products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments.\nIf applicable, availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors can also impact the acceptance of our product offerings.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nWe will need to effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, development, marketing and other resources in order to successfully pursue our research, development and commercialization efforts for our existing and future products. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and pre-clinical and clinical personnel. The loss of the services of any of our senior management, particularly Todd M. Pope and Joseph P. Slattery, could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our products. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. We employ these individuals on an at-will basis and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason and with or without notice. We will need to hire additional personnel as we continue to expand our research and development activities and build a sales and marketing organization.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical device and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will impede significantly the achievement of our research and development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy. In particular, if we lose any members of our senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion or at all and our business may be harmed as a result.\nBecause our design, development and manufacturing capabilities are limited, we may rely on third parties to design, develop, manufacture or supply some of our products. An inability to find additional or alternate sources for these services and products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2014, we used third-party design and development sources to assist in the design and development of our SurgiBot system. In the future, we may choose to use additional third-party sources for the design and development of our products. If these design and development partners are unable to provide their services in the timeframe or to the performance level that we require, we may not be able to establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from another supplier on a timely basis and in the manner that we require.\nIn 2014 we operated manufacturing facilities for production of the SPIDER System and maintained manufacturing facilities for the AMID HFD product (both products were discontinued in 2014). In the future, we may choose to use a third-party manufacturer for our other products. In addition, certain product component parts are likely to come from third-party suppliers. If these manufacturing partners are unable to produce our products or component parts in the amounts that we require, we may not be able to establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from another supplier on a timely basis and in the quantities we require.\nOur products require precise, high quality manufacturing. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with QSR, current \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d and other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with QSR, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business.\nAny performance failure by us or on the part of our design and development partners or contract manufacturers could delay product development or regulatory clearance or approval of our products, or commercialization of our products and future products, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting in additional losses. In addition, our dependence on any third party for design, development or manufacturing could adversely affect our future profit margins. Our ability to replace any then-existing manufacturer may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and, in the case of Class III devices, the FDA must approve any replacement manufacturer before manufacturing can begin. It may be difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe may become subject to potential product liability claims, and we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the design, testing, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and each of our product candidates that we are seeking to introduce to the market. Surgical medical devices involve significant risks of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis, infection, and even death. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or in our inability to secure coverage in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may have to pay the excess of this award out of our cash reserves, which could significantly harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component of a product causes tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. A product liability claim, even one without merit, could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees, and result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from managing our business.\nWe currently have a limited sales, marketing and distribution organization. If we are unable to develop our sales, marketing and distribution capability on our own or through collaborations with marketing partners, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.\nWe currently have limited marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. We intend to distribute our products through direct sales and independent contractor and distribution agreements with companies possessing established sales and marketing operations in the medical device industry, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in building our sales capabilities. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, our product revenue is likely to be lower than if we directly market or sell our products. In addition, any revenue we receive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. If we are not successful in commercializing our existing and future products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nIf we or our licensors are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop or license under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to commercialize our proposed products. We have numerous patent applications that are in process. For example, with respect to the SPIDER System and the SurgiBot System, we have three issued patents and we have filed over 30 patent applications in the United States and abroad. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For this and other reasons, we or our third-party collaborators may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired exclusivity. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the third-party patent or otherwise circumvent the third-party patent.\nOur strategy depends on our ability to promptly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. In addition, we will rely on third-party collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly during certain collaborations. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. If our present or future collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business will be adversely affected. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our collaborators to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to develop and use information that we regard as proprietary.\nThe issuance of a patent provides a presumption, but does not guarantee that it is valid. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged or potentially circumvented. Moreover, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any such challenge to our patents or patent applications would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, future court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of any patent, including those owned by medical device companies.\nOur pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of medical device companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in medical device patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, the enforceability or scope of our owned or licensed patents in the United States or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties.\nWe cannot assure you that any patents that will issue, that may issue or that may be licensed to us will be enforceable or valid or will not expire prior to the commercialization of our products, thus allowing others to more effectively compete with us. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not adequately protect our future products.\nIf we or our licensors are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we will seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees also generally provide and will generally provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in related inventions. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nOther entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale or import products or impair our competitive position. In addition, to the extent that a third party develops new technology that covers our products, we may be required to obtain licenses to that technology, which licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the third-party patent or circumvent the third-party patent, which would be costly and would require significant time and attention of our management. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing products using our technology. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, business prospects and results of operations.\nThird parties may sue us for infringing their patent rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of others. In addition, a third party may claim that we have improperly obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information. Furthermore, in connection with our third-party license agreements, we generally have agreed to indemnify the licensor for costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to intellectual property rights. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management\u2019s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf any parties successfully claim that our creation or use of proprietary technologies infringes upon their intellectual property rights, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nOur business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with domestic and international operations.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with conducting business domestically and internationally, in part due to some of our suppliers being located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in compliance with U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. and non-U.S. regulations and customs;\n\u2022\nchanges in non-U.S. currency exchange rates and currency controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic environment;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-U.S. governments;\n\u2022\nnegative consequences from changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including differing labor relations.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $93.8 million, which was 69% of total assets. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and share price declines may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nOur stockholders have experienced dilution of their percentage ownership of our stock and may experience additional dilution in the future.\nAs a result of the Merger, we issued new shares of common stock to certain former TransEnterix Surgical stockholders, representing approximately 65% of the total outstanding voting power of all our stockholders immediately following the closing of the Merger. The issuance of these shares caused existing stockholders at the time of the Merger to experience immediate and significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the private placement issuance of our Series B Preferred Stock in September 2013 caused substantial dilution to our stockholders, as each share of Series B Preferred Stock was converted into ten shares of our common stock on December 6, 2013, and our stockholders experienced additional dilution in our April 2014 $56 million common stock public offering.\nWe will likely need to raise substantial additional capital in order to continue our operations and achieve our business objectives. The future issuance of the Company\u2019s equity securities will further dilute the ownership of our outstanding common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.\nDuring the two years ended December 31, 2014, the market price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $14.00 per share to a low of $0.22 per share, and our stock price continues to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nvariations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the medical device industry;\n\u2022\nthe results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nFurther, the stock market in general, and the market for medical device companies in particular, has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The volatility of our common stock is further exacerbated due to its low trading volume. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock and the loss of some or all of your investment.\nTrading of our common stock is limited, and trading restrictions imposed on us by applicable regulations may further reduce trading in our common stock, making it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares; and future sales of common stock could reduce our stock price.\nTrading of our common stock is currently conducted on the NYSE MKT. The liquidity of our common stock is limited, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also as it may be adversely affected by delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us, if at all. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 41% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock were held by officers, directors and beneficial owners of at least 10% of our outstanding shares, each of whom is subject to certain restrictions with regard to trading our common stock. These factors may result in different prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained in a more liquid market and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock. In addition, without a large public float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate his investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future, if at all.\nSales by stockholders of substantial amounts of our shares of common stock, the issuance of new shares of common stock by us or the perception that these sales may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment in our common stock.\nDirectors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities own a significant percentage of our capital stock, and they may make decisions that you do not consider to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 47% of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, if some or all of them acted together, they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of our board of directors and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nIn connection with the Merger, we entered into a voting and lock-up agreement with certain of our stockholders pursuant to which such stockholders agreed to vote to approve certain corporate actions following the Merger.\nIn connection with the Merger and the related private placement transaction, stockholders holding an aggregate of 93% of our common stock on the effective date of the Merger, and members of our Board of Directors, entered into lock-up and voting agreements (each, a Voting Agreement), pursuant to which such persons agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell, transfer or otherwise convey any of the Company\u2019s securities held by them (collectively, Covered Securities) for one year following the Merger closing date. The Voting Agreements provide that such persons may sell, transfer or convey: (i) up to 50% of their respective Covered Securities commencing on September 3, 2014, the one-year anniversary of the Merger closing date; and (ii) up to an aggregate of 75% of their respective Covered Securities during the period commencing on March 3, 2015, the eighteen-month anniversary of the Merger closing date. The restrictions on transfer contained in the Voting Agreements cease to apply to the Covered Securities on September 3, 2015, the second anniversary of the Merger closing date. In accordance with a Registration Rights Agreement dated September 3, 2013, we included many of these stockholders as selling stockholders on a shelf registration statement we filed in November 2014. On such shelf registration statement we registered, for the account of such selling stockholders, the Covered Securities that were released from the transfer restrictions of the Voting Agreement on September 3, 2014. Sales of our common stock by such selling stockholders could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and increase the volatility of our common stock trading price.", "PERMNO": 76908, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "TRXC"}
