{"cik": "7536", "company": "ARROW ELECTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nDescribed below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company\u2019s management believes are applicable to the company\u2019s business and the industries in which it operates. Please see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for a discussion of the company's market risk. If any of the described events occur, the company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, political instability, government regulation (including tax regulation), climate change, employee attraction and retention, and customers\u2019 inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of extraordinary or unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, military or political conflicts, epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters (such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods), or other catastrophic events. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company, its customers and suppliers, and as a result, are not discussed in detail below, but are applicable to the company.\nOperational Risks\nIf the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, or if supply chain shortages and other disruptions occur, the company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of the company\u2019s inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancellable at any time or on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). However, the recent global semi-conductor shortages have resulted in some suppliers increasing the amount of non-cancelable orders, which limits our ability to adjust down our inventory levels in the event of market downturns, and could have a negative impact on the financial results of the company. The company seeks to limit these risks by passing non-cancellable terms on to customers, where possible.\nSome of the company\u2019s businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company\u2019s suppliers accounted for approximately 17% of the company\u2019s consolidated sales in 2021. To the extent that the company\u2019s significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution, experience disruptions in their supply chains, cease to continue doing business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the company\u2019s suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. Further, the supplier landscape has continued to experience a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts, and which could expose the company to increased risks, including increased pricing and dependence on a smaller number of suppliers. Increasing consolidation in the industries where the company\u2019s suppliers operate may occur as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies, which could result in reduced supplies, as companies seek to eliminate duplicative product lines, and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has created and continues to create significant shortages, disruptions, constraints, extended lead times, and unpredictability across the global supply chain. Shortages in electronics components markets and supply chain logistical issues have impacted the company's business. The extent to which supply constraints will continue to impact the company's results will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to contain or treat its impact, among others. These future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nThe company\u2019s revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and connector), and IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical and may be impacted by shortages and other disruptions in the global supply chain.\nThe semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns. The COVID-19 pandemic has created and continues to create significant shortages, disruptions, constraints, extended lead times and unpredictability in the global supply chain and especially in the semiconductor market. Sales of semiconductor products and\nrelated services represented approximately 57%, 54%, and 49%, of the company\u2019s consolidated sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The sale of the company\u2019s PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market. Accordingly, the company\u2019s revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market. Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company\u2019s ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.\nThe competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company\u2019s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company\u2019s competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and the need for constant attention to improve service and product offerings and increase market share. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, and quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it difficult to retain its market share. Further, the enterprise computing distributors industry has recently experienced increased consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale, market presence, and purchasing power than before. As a result, competition among enterprise computing distributors has increased. In addition, there is no guarantee that the company\u2019s response to and growth in emerging technologies will be successful. Also, customers may seek commitments from the company related to sustainability and environmental impacts, and meeting these commitments may increase the company's cost of operations. The company\u2019s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nDeclines in value of the company\u2019s inventory could materially adversely affect its business.\nThe market for the company\u2019s products and services is subject to rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Although many of the company\u2019s suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements. For example, many of the company\u2019s suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of products the company purchased in a particular time frame. Therefore, the company is not fully protected from declines in the value of the company\u2019s inventory, and such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe company\u2019s lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.\nMost of the company\u2019s sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions over which the company has little or no control, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer\u2019s industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, changing in pricing driven by changing environmental laws and regulations, or the effects of climate change on pricing and sourcing, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company\u2019s business.\nThe company\u2019s non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\nIn 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 66%, 65%, and 60%, respectively, of the company\u2019s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the company\u2019s international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u2022import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u2022the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n\u2022potential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022trade protection measures, import and export tariffs and other restrictions, duties and value-added taxes;\n\u2022transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations;\n\u2022foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;\n\u2022stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;\n\u2022the uncertainty surrounding the effects of Brexit;\n\u2022environmental protection laws and regulations, including those related to climate change;\n\u2022potential social unrest, military conflicts, government shutdowns and disruptions, and political risks; and\n\u2022currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.\nAlso, the company\u2019s gross margins in the components business in the Asia-Pacific region tend to be lower than those in other markets in which the company sells products and services. If sales in this market increase as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower. While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, such risks could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nChanges in the company\u2019s global mix of earnings, and changes in tax law and policy, could materially adversely impact results.\nThe company\u2019s effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings among countries having different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and certain U.S. and international tax policy and enforcement efforts, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, the European Commission\u2019s state aid investigations, and other initiatives adversely affecting taxation of international businesses. For example, in October 2021, a substantial majority of the OECD\u2019s participating countries and jurisdictions agreed to introduce a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate that would apply to companies with revenue over a set threshold and that could be assessed potentially as early as 2023. Furthermore, many of the countries where the company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their corporate tax policy, which could result in tax legislation and enforcement that adversely impacts the company\u2019s tax provision and value of deferred assets and liabilities. For instance, proposed legislation in the U.S. includes a new 15% corporate profits minimum tax on corporations that report over $1 billion of profits to shareholders, a new 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases, limitations on interest deductions of international financial reporting groups, and increases to the tax rate applied to profits earned outside the U.S. Additionally, tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and these audits may result in allocations of income and/or deductions that may result in tax assessments different from amounts that have been estimated. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of the company\u2019s provision for taxes. Such tax changes could increase the effective tax rates in many of the countries where the company has operations and ultimately could have an adverse effect on overall tax liability, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact the company\u2019s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWhen the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.\nAs part of the company\u2019s history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;\n\u2022unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;\n\u2022not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and\n\u2022potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\nFurther, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company\u2019s core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company\u2019s business.\nThe company\u2019s current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. The size and complexity of the company\u2019s computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company\u2019s ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company\u2019s business.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nProducts sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.\nThe company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims. While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company\u2019s ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where the company does business. The company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages. Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount and may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.\nTariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect the company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the United States and the Chinese government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S., China, or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but the company cannot predict further developments. The tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of the company\u2019s businesses and customer demand for certain products which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nIn addition, in the event that the company pays tariffs for products it imports from China which are then re-exported to other locations outside of the United States, the company may be eligible for refunds of certain tariffs. In order to qualify for these tariff drawbacks, the company must provide data and documentation to the U.S. government that it must obtain from third-party sources, such as its suppliers. There is no guarantee the company will be able to obtain this additional data and documentation from those other sources, which could result in the U.S. government rejecting the drawback requests. Further, there are additional administrative costs expended by the company in furtherance of these efforts. Finally, due to the backlog of drawback applications, the U.S. government has been slow in issuing the associated drawback refunds. The company\u2019s inability to obtain the drawback refunds or significant delays in receiving them could result in a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business.\nThe company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (\u201cOFAC\u201d). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (\u201cU.S. Products\u201d) are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction\u2019s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions\u2019 export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. For example, in 2019, the company determined that from 2015 to 2019 a limited number of non-executive employees, without first obtaining required authorization from the company or the United States government, had facilitated product shipments with an aggregate total invoiced value of approximately $4.8 million, to resellers for reexports to persons covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The company has voluntarily reported these activities to OFAC and the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d), conducted an internal investigation and terminated or disciplined the employees involved. BIS has closed its investigation and issued the company a warning letter without referring the matter for further proceedings. No penalties have been imposed by BIS. The company has cooperated fully and intends to continue to cooperate fully with OFAC with respect to its review, which may result in the imposition of penalties, the magnitude of which the company is currently not able to estimate. In addition, the company\u2019s distribution process includes the use of third parties that operate outside of the company\u2019s direct control. Although the company conducts risk based due diligence on third parties in its distribution supply chain, noncompliance with applicable import, export, and other laws and regulations by these third parties may negatively impact the company.\nFurther, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, and other national and sub-national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other affiliated parties from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or transfers of money or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. The company engages third parties to provide services. The company can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, contractors, and counterparties, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. While the company has policies and procedures to foster compliance, any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nThe company is subject to environmental laws and regulations and sustainability initiatives, and may be impacted by climate change, in ways that could materially adversely affect its business.\nA number of jurisdictions in which the company\u2019s products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of products sold by the company and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental\nregulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.\nSome environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company\u2019s currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Under these laws and regulations, the company may be responsible for investigating, removing, or otherwise remediating hazardous substances released at properties or facilities it owns or operates, regardless of when such substances were released. As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (\u201cWyle\u201d) acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama. The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California. That lawsuit was ultimately settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area. The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company\u2019s ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.\nAdditionally, long-term climate change impacts, including the frequency and magnitude of severe weather events, and natural disasters, may significantly impact the company\u2019s operations and business, either directly or indirectly, by adversely affecting the price and availability of energy, and the supply of other services or materials throughout the company\u2019s supply chain, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nProposed and existing efforts to address concerns over climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect the company\u2019s costs of energy and other operating costs. Investors are placing a greater emphasis on environmental factors, and the company may be unable to meet investor expectations in this regard. In addition, a number of the company\u2019s customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that may impose sustainability standards on suppliers. The perceptions held by the company\u2019s shareholders, potential investors, suppliers, customers, other stakeholders, or the communities in which the company does business may depend, in part, on whether the company meets on a timely basis or at all the sustainability standards imposed on the company or that the company chooses or aspires to achieve. The subjective nature and wide variety of methods and processes used by various stakeholders, including investors, to assess sustainability criteria could result in a negative perception or misrepresentation of the company\u2019s sustainability policies and practices. Also, by electing to establish and publicly share the company\u2019s sustainability standards, the company\u2019s business may face increased scrutiny related to sustainability activities, and the company\u2019s reputation could be harmed. In addition, sustainability laws, regulations, requirements, and initiatives may increase compliance costs.\nThe company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company\u2019s ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nCertain of the company\u2019s products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company\u2019s third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company\u2019s business. Depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company\u2019s customers could also become the targets of litigation. The company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any infringement or indemnification claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:\n\u2022result in substantial cost to the company;\n\u2022divert management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022be time consuming to defend;\n\u2022result in substantial damage awards; or\n\u2022cause product shipment delays.\nAdditionally, if an infringement claim against the company or its customers is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company\u2019s operating expenses and materially harm the company\u2019s operating results and financial condition. Further, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all, which would then require the company to stop selling certain products or using certain technologies, which could negatively affect the company\u2019s ability to compete effectively.\nRestrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company\u2019s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations.\nRestrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company\u2019s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations. The success of portions of the company\u2019s business is dependent on its ability to recruit engineers and other professionals. Immigration laws in the United States and other countries in which the company operates are subject to legislative changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas. If immigration laws change or if more restrictive government regulations are enacted, the company\u2019s access to qualified and skilled professionals may be limited, the costs of doing business may increase, operations may be disrupted, and the company\u2019s business may be materially negatively impacted.\nThe company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it or as a result of misconduct or other improper activities by its employees or contractors.\nGlobal businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts. The evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, is making it increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive to the operations of the business. Misconduct or failure of its employees or contractors to adhere to company policy may further heighten such risks. As a result, the company could experience a material loss to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.\nIn addition, misconduct by its employees or contractors may include intentional failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to the company. Such misconduct could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to the company, including to it's reputation.\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any other precautions the company takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting the company from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against the company, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, which could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s business. Whether or not the company is successful in defending against such actions or investigations, it could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending itself against any of these claims or investigations.\nCyber security and privacy incidents and also ransomware may hurt the company\u2019s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.\nThe company\u2019s information technology systems could be subject to cyber security and privacy incidents, including invasion, cyber-attacks, ransom demands, or data privacy breaches by employees and others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company\u2019s operations and/or loss or compromise of, or damage to, the company\u2019s or any of its customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 data, confidential information, or reputation. The company\u2019s information\ntechnology systems security measures may also be compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to compromise the company\u2019s data, assets and information technology systems. Any such incident could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company\u2019s information technology systems that could potentially have an adverse impact on the company\u2019s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company\u2019s information technology systems and data and information stored on those systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or protective measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company\u2019s operations, could be a source of risk in the event of a failure of their own systems and infrastructure or could experience their own privacy or security event which could create risks similar to those described above.\nThe company makes investments seeking to address these risks and vulnerabilities, including ongoing monitoring, updating networks and systems, and personnel awareness training of potential cyber security and privacy threats to help ensure employees remain diligent in identifying potential risks. In addition, the company has deployed monitoring capabilities to support early detection, internal and external escalation, and effective responses to potential anomalies. As part of the company\u2019s regular review of potential risks, the company analyzes emerging cyber security and privacy threats as well as the company\u2019s plan and strategies to address them and presents them to senior management. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and information systems and to prevent data loss and other security and privacy incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security or privacy incident, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, managing its brand and reputation, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps.\nAlso, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company\u2019s actual or perceived failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others, as well as impact to its brand and reputation, as a result of which the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nFinancial Risks\nThe company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.\nThe company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness. At December 31, 2021, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $222.2 million. In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.0 billion and a committed North America asset securitization program of $1.3 billion, of which the company had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2021. The company\u2019s ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control.\nThe company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs. The company\u2019s ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors, including general financial market conditions and the company\u2019s debt ratings. Further, any increase in the company\u2019s level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company\u2019s current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms, if at all, negatively impact the price of the company\u2019s common stock, increase its interest payments under existing debt agreements and have other negative implications on its business, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control. Under the terms of any additional external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company\u2019s existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the company\u2019s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe agreements governing some of the company\u2019s financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management\u2019s discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.\nThe agreements governing some of the company\u2019s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:\n\u2022grant liens on assets;\n\u2022make investments or certain acquisitions;\n\u2022merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;\n\u2022incur additional debt; or\n\u2022engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.\nFurther, if an event of default under any of the company\u2019s existing debt agreements occurred or became imminent, while the company could explore alternative sources of capital, whether debt or equity, such alternative sources may be more expensive than the costs it incurred under the company's existing credit facility. Further, the company may be unable to borrow additional amounts under the existing credit facility, and as a result may be unable to make acquisitions or fund share repurchases, and the lenders thereunder may be able to accelerate the company\u2019s obligations under the debt agreement. This circumstance would have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe company\u2019s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired. The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions. The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values. The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.\nRefer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nA decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, and increase in income tax rates, or the company\u2019s inability to meet long-term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the company\u2019s reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. If the company were required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company\u2019s consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North America asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nGeneral Risks\nThe company\u2019s success depends upon its ability to attract, retain, motivate and develop key executive and employee talent and the strategies they develop and implement.\nAny failure to attract, retain, motivate and develop key executive and employee talent may materially and adversely affect the company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The company\u2019s success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its key executives. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, business operations, and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience in a timely manner, or if at all, at similar level of remuneration and other benefits.\nIf the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nAn effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company\u2019s internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company\u2019s access to capital.\nGeneral business conditions are vulnerable to the effects of epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially disrupt the company\u2019s business and have a negative impact on the company\u2019s financial results and financial condition.\nThe company is vulnerable to the general economic effects of epidemics, pandemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant macroeconomic uncertainty, volatility and disruption, including supply constraints, extended lead times, and unpredictability across many markets. Supply chain constraints are being caused by shortages in electronics components markets and supply chain logistical issues resulting in extended lead times and unpredictability. Also, there has been a substantial curtailment of travel and business activities due to COVID-19, which has caused and may continue to cause significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 and ensuing challenges such as supply chain constraints will continue to impact the company\u2019s results will depend primarily on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the severity and duration of the crisis, the speed and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment developments and deployment, the impact of vaccine and other mandates, potential mutations of COVID-19, and the impact of actions taken and that will be taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. For example, COVID-19 or other epidemics or pandemics may result in the company having to limit operations, rely on personnel working from home, or implement additional restrictions as a result of widespread government restrictions, any of which may negatively impact productivity or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact the company's business. Remote working could increase the company\u2019s cyber security risk. In addition, a U.S. or global recession or a banking crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial results and financial condition, including by reducing the demand for its products and services, reducing the access to its supplies, increasing customer defaults, reducing its access to capital, and reducing the value of its common stock.", "PERMNO": 29209, "SIC": 5065, "TIC": "ARW"}
