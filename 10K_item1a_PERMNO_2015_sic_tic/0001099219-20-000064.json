{"cik": "1099219", "company": "METLIFE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risk factors could harm our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. You should not consider these risk factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect MetLife. These risk factors should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cBusiness,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and the other reports and materials filed by MetLife with the SEC. Many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nEconomic Environment and Capital Markets Risks\nDifficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition\nMarket factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, derivative prices and availability, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer and government spending, business investment, volatility, disruptions and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, and government actions could harm our financial condition, business operations, or ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and meet our obligations. Such factors could also harm our results of operations, liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses, derivative losses, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.\nSustained periods of low interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and the impact of guarantees, including increases in liabilities, capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. Any of these events could also impair our financial strength ratings.\nHigher unemployment, higher inflation, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, lower consumer spending, elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations, lapses or surrenders of policies, reduced demand for our products, and deferred or canceled payments of insurance premiums may negatively affect our earnings and capitalization and harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nDeclining equity markets may decrease the account value of our products, reducing certain fees generated by these products, which may increase the level of insurance liabilities we carry, accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n(\u201cDAC\u201d), and increase funding to our captive reinsurers. Additionally, lower interest rates may reduce returns in fixed income investments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nSome of our products expose us to interest rate risks, including reductions in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\nDuring periods of lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative, harming our results of operations or financial condition.\nLower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, our reserves may need to be increased. Accordingly, declining and sustained low interest rates may harm our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, profitability, or issuance of dividends.\nInterest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This may result in cash outflows requiring the sale of investments on less favorable terms, resulting in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (\u201cVOBA\u201d), reducing net income, harming our credit instrument covenants and rating agency assessment of our financial condition, and cause us to accelerate the amortization of negative VOBA, increasing net income. Interest rate increases may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity needs. Furthermore, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains on fixed income securities may decrease and our unrealized losses may increase. The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed income securities would be recognized in net income when a gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or if the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other than temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\nActions resulting from the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board and of central banks around the world may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, it is not possible to invest assets at the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. In addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity because our non-qualified derivatives are recorded at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model, or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.\nRegulators, agencies, or benchmark administrators may take actions resulting in changes to the way LIBOR is determined, the discontinuance of reliance on LIBOR as a benchmark rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates, which could harm our business. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing a Secured Overnight Financing Rate, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. Although the full impact of transition remains unclear, any change or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely impact interest rates, as well as the value of, return on and markets for a broad array of financial products, including certain of our financial instruments whose value is tied to LIBOR or a LIBOR alternative. Additionally, the effect on our business and financial instruments will vary depending on existing fallback provisions in individual contracts and whether, how, and when industry participants develop and adopt alternative reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products or instruments. Uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR, and uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments could harm the value of such instruments. Our transition to alternative reference rates and implementation of necessary changes to our systems, processes and models requires significant work and may negatively impact other aspects of our business, including products, pricing, operations, and valuations. Any change to or discontinuation of similar benchmark rates other than LIBOR could have similar effects.\nCredit Spread Risk\nChanges in credit spreads may result in market price volatility and cash flow variability. Market price volatility can make valuations of our securities difficult if trading becomes less frequent, which could harm our results of operations or financial condition and may require additional reserves. Market volatility may cause changes in credit spreads, defaults and a lack of pricing transparency, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income.\nEquity Risk\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products\u2019 revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of our managed assets. The variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products\u2019 revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures, which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds\u2019 need for cash. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments or equity securities.\nReal Estate Risk\nChanges in the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility, interest rate fluctuations, commodity prices, farm incomes and housing and commercial property market conditions, among others, may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate and real estate joint ventures, harming our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nObligor and Counterparty Risk\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Additionally, U.S. states and municipalities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions.\nThe issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities and mortgage loans we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. Additionally, the change in value of underlying collateral within asset-backed securities (\u201cABS\u201d), including mortgage-backed securities, may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may cause the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and our earnings to decline and the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio to increase.\nMany of our transactions with counterparties such as brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, investment funds, reinsurers and other financial institutions expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies, such as investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks\u2019 credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. Any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes may harm our business and results of operations.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Risk\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, net income from non-U.S. operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also make certain of our products less attractive to customers, which may increase levels of early policy terminations and decrease sales volume and our in force business. Such negative effects may be exacerbated if international markets experience severe economic or financial disruptions or significant currency devaluations, if a foreign economy is determined to be \u201chighly inflationary,\u201d or if a country withdraws from the Euro zone. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our operations, earnings or investments in the affected countries.\nWe may be unable to mitigate the risk of such changes in exchange rates due to unhedged positions, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting resulting from derivative gains (losses) on non-qualifying hedges, the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, or other factors. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the translation of results into our U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements.\nDerivatives Risk\nIf our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under our derivatives, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. A counterparty\u2019s or central clearinghouse\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of derivatives agreements or to return collateral could harm our financial condition and results of operations, including our liquidity. If the net estimated fair value of a derivative to which we are a party declines, we may need to pledge collateral or make payments. In addition, ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of derivative counterparties may require us to utilize additional capital for the impacted businesses. Furthermore, our derivatives valuation may change based on our valuation methodology or errors in such valuation or valuation methodology.\nTerrorism and Security Risks\nThe continued threat of terrorism, ongoing military and other actions, potential military conflicts, and heightened security measures may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by such threats. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions, and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Terrorist or military actions also could disrupt our operations centers and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies.\nAdverse Capital and Credit Market Conditions May Significantly Affect Our Ability to Meet Liquidity Needs, Our Access to Capital and Our Cost of Capital\nIn cases of volatility, disruptions, or other conditions in global capital markets we may have to seek additional financing, the availability and cost of which could be adversely affected by market conditions, regulatory considerations, availability of credit to our industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, reduced business activity, or investment losses, and the perception of our financial prospects. Our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing we need on favorable terms or at all. We may be required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending or derivatives agreements or post collateral or make payments related to specified counterparty agreements.\nOur business and financial results may suffer without sufficient liquidity through impaired ability to pay claims, other operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, cash or collateral to our subsidiaries, maintain our securities lending, replace certain maturing liabilities, sustain our operations and investments, and repurchase our common stock. Capital and credit market volatility may limit our access to capital we need to operate, limiting our ability to raise capital, issue the types of securities we would prefer, timely replace maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory requirements, and access capital to grow our business, any of which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Such events could harm our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, or statutory capital position.\nAn Inability to Access Our Credit Facility Could Result in a Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings\nWe may fail to comply with or fulfill all conditions under the unsecured credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. (\u201cMetLife Funding\u201d) maintain. Lenders may fail to fund their lending commitments under the Credit Facility due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons. This could harm our ability to meet our obligations, our credit and financial strength ratings, as well as our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nA Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Harm Our Financial Condition or Results of Operations\nNationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d) and others may, at any time, downgrade our financial strength ratings or credit ratings, lower our ratings outlooks, increase the scope or frequency of their reviews, or increase capital or other requirements to maintain ratings. Such changes could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition by reducing product sales, forcing us to change product pricing, increasing financing costs, increasing policy surrenders or withdrawals, increasing collateral requirements, increasing the risk of derivative terminations, increasing the cost of reinsurance, increasing regulatory scrutiny, or various other factors.\nReinsurance May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses\nOur reinsurance costs may increase, or reinsurance may not be available, due to market conditions or other factors, which may reduce our earnings. Our risk of loss may increase if we decrease the amount of our reinsurance. Any of these could harm our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue.\nWe may incur costs as a result of a reinsurer\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments, or inability or unwillingness to maintain collateral, harming our financial condition or results of operations, including our liquidity.\nOur Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases, and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity\nIf MetLife\u2019s ratings decline, market capacity is limited, or on other repricing occasions, our costs to finance statutory life insurance reserves may increase, harming our financial results. If regulators disallow assets to back statutory reserves, we would not be able to take some or all related statutory reserve credit, which may harm the statutory capitalization of certain of our insurance subsidiaries.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOur Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Laws, Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nInsurance or other regulators may change licensing, permit, or approval requirements, or take other actions that may harm our business. They may also take actions that harm our customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations, which may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products.\nRegulations such as financial services regulation, insurance regulation, regulation of variable annuities, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, accounting, cybersecurity regulation, privacy and data protection regulation, tort reform legislation and taxation, laws and regulations that affect customers, sales intermediaries, or others, and our or other parties\u2019 failure to comply with these requirements, may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. Adverse regulatory examinations or audits may also harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regulators may interpret rules differently from the way we have, or change interpretations of laws or rules, and legislators may change statutes, which may adversely affect our businesses. Changes to laws or to rules regulators propose or adopt may harm our business or ability to continue to offer products we do today or to introduce new products.\nWe may incur costs to comply with laws and regulations, and changes to these laws and regulations may increase our expenses. Our failure to strictly comply with our own policies or with regulatory requirements may harm our reputation or result in sanctions or legal claims.\nLaws, regulations or regulatory actions may limit or change the type, amount or structure of compensation or benefits we offer our employees or others, which may harm our ability to compete in recruiting and retaining key personnel. Our failure to comply with fiduciary or other benefit-related obligations may harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may incur capital requirement, reserve requirement, risk management infrastructure, and reporting costs to comply with solvency standards. We may be subject to enhanced capital standards, supervision and additional requirements, such as group capital standards or insurer capital standards. MetLife, Inc. could be compelled to undergo FDIC liquidation if it becomes insolvent or is in danger of defaulting on its obligations, imposing greater losses on shareholders and unsecured creditors than under the Bankruptcy Code. This could also apply to financial institutions whose debt we hold and could harm the value of our holdings. We could be assessed charges in connection with a financial company liquidation, which could harm our financial condition.\nOur ability to react to rapidly changing economic conditions and the dynamic, competitive markets may be impaired if our product designs do not allow frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements, or if we are unable to work collaboratively with regulators. Changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could harm our ability to react to such changing conditions. Rules on defined benefit pension plan funding may reduce the likelihood or delay corporate plan sponsors in terminating their plans or engaging in transactions to partially or fully transfer pension obligations. This could affect the mix of our pension risk transfers and increase non-guaranteed funding products and could harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in Tax Laws or Interpretations of Such Laws Could Reduce Our Earnings and Materially Impact Our Operations by Increasing Our Corporate Taxes and Making Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws - including U.S. Tax Reform - could increase our corporate taxes and reduce our earnings. Changes may increase our effective tax rate or have implications that make our products less attractive to consumers. Tax authorities may enact laws, change regulations to increase existing taxes, or add new types of taxes and authorities who have not imposed taxes in the past, may impose additional taxes. Any such changes may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCustomers shifting away from employee benefits, life insurance and annuity contracts, or other tax-preferred products would reduce our income from these products and our asset base, reducing our earnings and potentially affecting the value of our deferred tax assets.\nLitigation and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and Harm to Our Reputation\nLegal or regulatory actions, inquiries or investigations, whether ongoing or yet to come, could harm our reputation, ability to attract or retain customers or employees, business, financial condition, or results of operations, even if we ultimately prevail. Regulators or private parties may bring class actions, individual suits, or investigations seeking large recoveries alleging wrongs relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, investments, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties. We may be unable to anticipate the outcome of a litigation and the amount or range of loss because we do not know how adversaries, fact finders, courts, regulators, or others will evaluate evidence, the law, or accounting principles, and whether they will do so differently than we have.\nCapital Risks\nLegal and Regulatory Restrictions May Prevent Us from Paying Dividends and Repurchasing Our Stock\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, general market conditions, the market price of our common stock compared to management\u2019s assessment of the stock\u2019s underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, other legal and accounting factors, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board may preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock, or pay dividends or interest on our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the \u201cSeries A preferred stock\u201d), junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures.\nWe may be restricted from repurchasing shares or entering into share repurchase programs when we are aware of material non-public information, harming our ability to repurchase shares.\nAs a Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its Subsidiaries to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. It may also be insufficient to meet our free cash flow goals and our plans to distribute cash to shareholders.\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required, or if they determine payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. Business conditions, rating agency considerations, taxation, dividend and repatriation rules, and monetary transfer and foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\nInvestment Risks\nDefaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events May Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold, Resulting in a Reduction in Our Net Income and Profitability\nOur estimated fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio may increase, in case of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels, should securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed income securities may increase our writedowns or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change, harming our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property-type, may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the price we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans could harm our investment portfolio, business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe May Have Difficulty Selling Certain Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner and Realizing Full Value\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, whether due to limited markets in privately-placed fixed income securities, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds, reduced liquidity for other investments during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. We may realize losses that harm our results of operations and financial condition and our financial ratios, which could harm our compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures.\nWe may face similar risks if we are required under our securities lending program to return significant amounts of cash collateral that we have invested. Our securities lending activities may decrease, harming our net investment income.\nOur Requirements to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments Related to Declines in Estimated Fair Value of Derivatives Transactions or Specified Assets in Connection with OTC-Cleared and OTC-Bilateral Transactions May Adversely Affect Our Liquidity, Expose Us to Central Clearinghouse and Counterparty Credit Risk, and Increase our Costs of Hedging\nWe may have to increase the collateral we pledge and the payments we make under our derivatives transactions. Regulators, clearinghouses, or counterparties may restrict or eliminate eligible collateral or charge us to pledge such collateral, which would increase our costs and harm the liquidity and composition of our investments.\nChanges to Our Valuation of Securities and Investments, the Allowances and Impairments Taken on Our Investments, and Our Methodologies, Estimations and Assumptions Could Harm Our Results of Operations or Financial Condition\nDuring periods of market disruption or rapidly-changing market conditions, such as significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, or infrequent trading, or when market data is limited, our assets may become less liquid and we may base our asset valuations on less-observable and more subjective judgments, assumptions, or methods that may result in estimated fair values that significantly vary by period, and may exceed the investment\u2019s sale price. Decreases in the estimated fair value of our securities may harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nBusiness Risks\nDifferences Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial Results\nTo the extent that our actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in establishing claim liabilities, we could be required to reduce DAC or VOBA, increase our liabilities or incur higher costs.\nThe amounts that we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future, may vary from what we expect. We may change our liability assumptions and increase our liabilities based on actual experience and accounting requirements. Our operating practices and procedures that support our policyholders and contractholder obligation assumptions, such as obtaining, accumulating, and filtering data, and our use of technology, such as database analysis and electronic communications, may affect our reserve estimates. To the extent that these practices and procedures do not accurately produce the data to support our assumptions or cause us to change our assumptions, or to the extent that enhanced technological tools become available to us, we may change those assumptions and procedures, as well as our reserves. To the extent that any of our operating practices and procedures do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such errors may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may change our assumptions, models, or reserves due to increased longevity. Increases in the prevalence and accuracy of genetic testing, or restrictions on its use, may exacerbate adverse selection risks. Each of these may harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe Global Nature of Our Operations Exposes Us to a Variety of Political, Legal, Operational, Economic and Other Risks\nThe global nature of our business operations exposes us to a wide range of political, legal, operational, economic and other risks, including but not limited to: nationalization or expropriation of assets; imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies; changes in laws, their application or interpretation; political instability; economic or trade sanctions; dividend limitations; price controls; currency exchange controls or other transfer or exchange restrictions; difficulty enforcing contracts; regulatory restrictions; and public or political criticism of our business and operations.\nSuch actions or events may directly or indirectly harm our business or reputation in the relevant jurisdictions, as well as other jurisdictions. Some of our businesses operate in emerging markets, where many of these risks are heightened.\nAdditionally, we face risks that may impact our global operations, including but not limited to international trade agreements, uncertainties in intergovernmental organizations, pension system reforms, and others.\nIf we encounter labor problems with workers\u2019 associations or trade unions, or if any of our businesses are not successful, we may lose all or most of our investment in that business, which may harm our results of operations.\nExpanding our operations to new businesses or jurisdictions may require considerable management time and expenses before significant, if any, revenues and earnings are generated, which may reduce management and financial resources available for other uses. Our operations in new or existing markets may be unprofitable or achieve low margins, harming our operating margins and results of operations.\nCompetitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability\nCompetitive pressures, based on a number of factors including service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities, name recognition, and other factors, may adversely affect the persistency of our products and our ability to sell products in the future. We may be harmed by competition from other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, which may have a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, higher claims paying ability ratings, greater financial resources with which to compete, or pre-existing customer bases for financial services products. Additionally, we may lose purchasers of group insurance products that are underwritten annually due to more favorable terms from competitors. Furthermore, the investment management and securities brokerage businesses have relatively low barriers to entry and continually attract new entrants. Our customers and clients may engage other financial service providers, and the resulting loss of business may harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nAn increase in consolidation activity among banks and broker-dealers may negatively impact the insurance industry\u2019s sales and increase competition for access to distributors, resulting in greater distribution expenses and may impair our ability to market insurance products to or expand our current customer base. Consolidation and other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will renegotiate agreements on terms less favorable to us.\nIn addition, legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment for our business may not impact all activities and companies equally, which could adversely affect our competitive position within the insurance industry and the broader financial services industry.\nTechnological Changes May Present New and Intensified Challenges to Our Business\nTechnological changes may present us with new or intensified challenges. We may be unable to accurately, timely, or completely process the increased volume and variety of information relating to our businesses, including information related to deaths, that new technological tools for data collection and analysis make available. We may modify our assumptions, models, or reserves as a result of our review of such information. Changes in collection and analysis of data could expose us to regulatory or legal actions and may harm our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTechnological changes may change how we interact with customers, who may expect increased choices, and we may have to redesign our products as a result. Our distribution channels may become more automated to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. We may incur significant costs to implement these changes. If we are unsuccessful, our competitive position and distribution relationships may be harmed.\nTechnological advances may also change our investments composition and results. For example, changes in energy technology and increasing consumer preferences for e-commerce may harm the profitability of some businesses. Our failure to adequately adjust our investments may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCatastrophes May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and Reinsurance Availability\nClaims resulting from catastrophic events could harm our financial results, profitability, and financial condition. Catastrophic events could impair assets in or otherwise harm our investment portfolio, and could harm our reinsurers\u2019 financial condition, increasing the probability of reinsurance recoveries defaults. Catastrophic events may also reduce economic activity in affected areas, which could harm our business, prospects for new business, or value of our investments. The severity of claims from catastrophic events may be higher if property values increase due to inflation or other factors or our insured lives or property are geographically concentrated.\nMajor public health issues, such as a pandemic (e.g. the novel coronavirus COVID-19) or other event that causes a large number of illnesses or deaths, could harm our insurance operations and have a major impact on the global economy and financial markets. Governmental and non-governmental organizations may not effectively combat the spread and severity of such a pandemic, increasing their harm to us. An event that affects the workforce of one or more of our customers could increase our mortality or morbidity claims. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCatastrophe losses as a result of hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nClimate change may increase the frequency and severity of weather related disasters and pandemics. Climate change regulation may harm the value of investments we hold or harm our counterparties, including reinsurers.\nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. The liabilities we have established may not be adequate to cover our actual claim liabilities. Our efforts to manage risks may be impeded by restrictions on our ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas or on internal reinsurance transactions. We may be unable to obtain catastrophe reinsurance at rates we find acceptable, or at all.\nWe may be called upon to make contributions to guaranty associations or similar organizations as a result of catastrophes, which may harm our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe May Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block; Assets Allocated to the Closed Block Benefit Only the Holders of Closed Block Policies\nThe closed block assets established in connection with the MLIC demutualization, their cash flows, and the revenue from the closed block policies may not be sufficient to provide for the policies\u2019 guaranteed benefits. If they are not, we must fund the shortfall. We may choose, for competitive or other reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments with our general account funds. Such actions may reduce funds otherwise be available to us for other uses and could harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets\nWe may reduce our estimated fair value of business units, impairing our goodwill and charging net income, if prolonged market declines or other factors negatively impact the performance of our businesses, harming our results of operations or financial position.\nWe may write down long-lived assets if we conclude we will be unable to recover their carrying amount, which could harm our results of operations or financial position.\nWe may charge net income because we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize a deferred income tax asset, based on the performance of the business and its ability to generate future taxable income, harming our results of operations or financial position. In addition, we may need to write-off deferred tax assets if tax rates change.\nWe May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization of or Impair DAC, DSI or VOBA\nLow investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation, may harm the gross profit or margins that we use to amortize DAC, deferred sales inducements (\u201cDSI\u201d) and VOBA for many of our life and annuity products. We may accelerate that amortization in the period the actual experience is known, or due to significant or sustained equity market declines or significantly lower spreads, causing a charge to net income and harming our results of operations or financial condition.\nGuarantees Within Certain Products May Decrease Our Earnings, Increase the Volatility of Our Results, Result in Higher Risk Management Costs and Expose Us to Increased Counterparty Risk\nOur liabilities for guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits (\u201cGMDBs\u201d) (including but not limited to no-lapse guarantee benefits), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (\u201cGMWBs\u201d), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (\u201cGMABs\u201d), guaranteed minimum income benefits (\u201cGMIBs\u201d), and minimum crediting rate features could increase if equity markets decline or become more volatile, or interest rates decrease, harming our net income.\nOur derivatives and other risk management strategies to hedge our economic exposure to these liabilities may harm our results of operations. Our use of reinsurance and derivatives, or other risk management techniques may not offset the costs of guarantees or protect us against losses from changes in policyholder behavior or mortality or from market events. Any of these may harm our results of operations, including net income, capitalization, financial condition or liquidity, including our ability to receive dividends from our operating insurance companies.\nOperational Risks\nOur Risk Management Policies and Procedures or Our Models May Leave Us Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk\nOur enterprise risk management policies and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify every risk to which we are exposed. The assumptions, projections and data on which our risk management models are based may be inaccurate, and our models may not be suitable for their purpose, be misused, not operate properly, and contain errors. Our decisions, including determination of reserves, based on such model output and reports could harm our results of operations. Our model adjustments may also harm our results of operations. We may fail to adequately identify or remediate model errors. Our models may not fully predict future exposures or correctly reflect past experience, which may harm our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur evaluation of markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. We may not effectively identify and monitor all risks or appropriately limit our exposures and our associates, vendors or non-employee sales agents may not follow our risk management policies and procedures. Past or future misconduct by our associates, vendors or non-employee sales agents could result in investigations, violations of law, regulatory sanctions, litigation, reputational harm, or financial harm. We may have to implement more extensive or different risk management policies and procedures due to legal and regulatory requirements, which could impose costs and harm our results of operations.\nOur Policies and Procedures May Be Insufficient To Protect Us From Certain Operational Risks\nWe may make errors in any of the large number of transactions we process through our complex administrative systems. Our controls and procedures to prevent such errors may not be effective. Our controls and procedures to comply with and enforce contractual obligations may not always be effective. Mistakes can subject us to claims from our customers and may harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary and accurate information from our customers or their employees, we may be unable to provide or verify coverage and pay claims, or we may pay claims without sufficient documentation, which may harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe controls of our vendors on whom we rely may not meet our standards or be adequate, our vendors could fail to perform their services accurately or timely, the exchange of information between us and our vendors may be imperfect, or our vendors may suffer financial or reputational distress. Each of these may cause errors, misconduct, or discontinuation of services that could harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may fail to timely and completely escheat property. As a result, we may incur charges, reserve strengthening, and expenses, regulatory examinations, or penalties. Each of these may harm our reputation, regulatory relationships, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur practices and procedures may, at times, limit our efforts to contact all of our customers, which may result in delayed, untimely, or missed customer payments that may harm our reputation, regulatory relationships, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur associates, vendors, non-employee sales agents, customers, or others may commit fraud against us. Our policies and procedures may be ineffective in preventing, detecting or mitigating fraud and other illegal or improper acts, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur failure to attract, motivate and retain employees, develop talent, and plan for management succession may harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may identify internal control deficiencies, disclosure control deficiencies, or material weaknesses. These may harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or the market price of our common stock.\nA Failure in Our Cybersecurity or Other Information Security Systems or Our Disaster Recovery Plans, or Those of Our Suppliers, Could Result in a Loss or Disclosure of Confidential Information, Damage to Our Reputation and Impairment of Our Ability to Conduct Business Effectively\nWe and our suppliers\u2019 computer systems may suffer computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized or fraudulent access, human errors, cyberattacks or other penetrations. Our efforts to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent break-ins, attacks, fraud, security breaches or other unauthorized access to our and our suppliers\u2019 systems. We may not timely detect such incidents, and they may harm our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe, our suppliers, and our customers may suffer disasters such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, cyberattack or war, and disaster recovery systems may be insufficient, particularly if these affect computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data. Our ability to effectively conduct business and maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, could be severely compromised if key personnel are unavailable, our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide goods and services, and our associates\u2019 ability to perform their job responsibilities are impaired by a disaster. Any insurance for liability, operational and other risks may be insufficient to protect us against such losses or may become less readily available or more expensive. Regulators\u2019 or others\u2019 scrutiny of cybersecurity, including new laws or regulations, could increase our compliance costs. Any of these could harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial position. We may not be able to reliably access all of the documents and records in the information storage systems we use, whether electronic or physical. We may fail to obtain or maintain all of the records we need to accurately and timely administer and establish appropriate reserves for benefits and claims with respect to, our products, which may harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or our financial condition.\nOur continuous systems and processes evaluation and enhancement, including changes designed to enhance protective measures, increase our risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in our security measures, which could harm our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAny Failure to Protect the Confidentiality of Client Information Could Harm Our Reputation or Result in Legal or Regulatory Penalties\nWe or our suppliers may fail to maintain adequate internal controls, fail to comply with relevant policies and procedures, or policies, procedures and controls may not be sufficient. As a result, we may intentionally or unintentionally disclose or misuse confidential personal information, or others may misappropriate it, harming our reputation or causing civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We may incur higher costs to comply with laws on, or regulators\u2019 scrutiny of, our use, collection, management, or transfer of data and other privacy practices.\nChanges in Accounting Standards May Adversely Affect Our Financial Statements\nWe adopt accounting standard changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d), the IFRS Foundation, or others, and may do so earlier than required. We may not be able to predict or assess the effects of these changes, and they may harm our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Associates May Take Excessive Risks, Which Could Negatively Affect Our Financial Condition and Business\nOur associates, including executives and others who manage sales, investments, products, wholesaling, underwriting, and others, may take excessive risks. Our compensation programs and practices, and our other controls, may not effectively deter excessive risk-taking or misconduct. Our associates may take excessive risks which could harm our reputation, financial condition or business operations.\nWe May Experience Difficulty in or Complications from Marketing and Distributing Products\nOur product distributors may suspend, alter, reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us if we change our strategy, if our business performance declines, as a result of rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks, or for other reasons. Our distributors may merge, change their business models in ways that affect us, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, and new distribution channels could emerge, harming our distribution efforts. Distributors may try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to less favorable terms due to consolidation or other industry changes or for other reasons. Disruption or changes to our relationships with our distributors could harm our ability to market our products and could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur employees or unaffiliated firms or agents may distribute our products in an inappropriate manner, or our customers may not understand them or for whom they are unsuitable, harming our reputation or business.\nChanges in Our Assumptions Used for Our Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans May Result in Increased Expenses and Reduce Our Profitability\nWe may change our discount rate, rate of return on plan assets, mortality rate, compensation level or medical inflation assumptions, harming our benefit plan estimates, which could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability.\nWe May Not be Able to Protect Our Intellectual Property and May be Subject to Infringement Claims\nWe may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing on or misappropriating our intellectual property. We may incur litigation costs to enforce and protect it or to determine its scope or validity, and we may not be successful, harming our business, reputation and ability to compete.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims by third parties for infringement of intellectual property, breach of license usage rights, or misappropriation of trade secrets. We may incur significant expenses for any such claims. If we are found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party intellectual property right, we may be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain intellectual property. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly alternative. Consequently, such claims may harm our business, reputation, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Dispositions or Other Structural Changes\nWe Could Face Difficulties, Unforeseen Liabilities, Asset Impairments or Rating Actions Arising from Business Acquisitions or Integrating and Managing Growth of Such Businesses, Dispositions of Businesses, or Legal Entity Reorganizations\nAcquisitions and dispositions of businesses, joint ventures, and other structural changes expose us to a number of risks arising from, among other factors, economic, operational, strategic, financial, tax, legal, regulatory, and compliance risks. As a result, there can be no assurance that any acquisition, disposition or reorganization will be completed as contemplated, or at all. We may not realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. Effecting these transactions may result in harm to our business, unforeseen expenditures and liabilities or a performance different than we expected. The areas where we face risks include, among others, rights to indemnification for losses, regulatory, liquidity and capital requirements, loss of customers, distributors, suppliers and key personnel, diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges or growth strategies from maximizing business value, and inability to realize anticipated efficiencies. Our success in conducting business through joint ventures will depend on our ability to manage a variety of issues, including: (i) our exposure to additional operational, financial, legal or compliance risks as a result of entry into certain joint ventures; (ii) our dependence on a joint venture counterparty given limits on our ownership or distribution requirements, as well as for resources, including capital and product distribution, may reduce our control over, financial returns from, or the value of a joint venture; and (iii) our cooperation with joint venture counterparties, failure of a joint venture counterparty to meet its obligations, or an election to alter, modify or terminate the relationship may negatively impact our results of operations, thereby impairing our investment.\nReorganizing or consolidating the legal entities through which we conduct business may raise similar risks. Our success in realizing the benefits from legal entity reorganizations will also depend on our management of various issues, including regulatory approvals, modification of our operations and changes to our investment portfolios or derivatives hedging activities.\nAny of these risks, if realized, could prevent us from achieving the benefits we expect or could otherwise harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe Are Subject to Risks Related to Our Separation from and Continuing Relationship with Brighthouse\nWe may not realize any or all of the expected tax or other benefits of the Brighthouse separation, which may harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Brighthouse may not succeed, causing claims against us that may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nGovernance Risks\nMetLife, Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors May Influence the Outcome of Stockholder Votes on Many Matters Due to the Voting Provisions of the MetLife Policyholder Trust\nOur Board of Directors may be able to influence stockholder votes by virtue of the provisions of the MetLife Policyholder Trust and the number of shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock held by it. Trust beneficiary vote instructions are likely to have disproportionate weight on votes concerning certain fundamental corporate actions because the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by the trust in proportion to those instructions actually received.\nWe may incur regulatory, mailing, or other costs related to the termination of the trust, distribution of the common stock held in trust to beneficiaries and the resulting increase in the number of shareholders. The increase to our shareholder base with full voting rights may affect the outcome of matters brought to a stockholder vote and other aspects of our corporate governance.\nState Laws, Federal Laws, and MetLife, Inc.\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws May Delay, Deter or Prevent Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might Consider in Their Best Interests\nState laws, federal laws and MetLife, Inc.\u2019s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider favorable. These provisions may adversely affect the price of MetLife, Inc.\u2019s common stock if they discourage takeover attempts.\nStockholders\u2019 changes to MetLife, Inc.\u2019s corporate governance may make it more difficult for the Board of Directors to protect stockholders\u2019 interests.", "PERMNO": 87842, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "MET"}
