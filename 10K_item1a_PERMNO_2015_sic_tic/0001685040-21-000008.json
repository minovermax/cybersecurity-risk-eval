Risk Factors\nIndex to Risk Factors\nPage\nOverview\nRisks Related to Our Business\nEconomic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks\nInvestments-Related Risks\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOperational Risks\nRisks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOverview\nYou should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors are important to understanding the contents of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. A summary of the factors described below can be found in \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Summary of Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe materialization of any risks and uncertainties set forth below or identified in \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Summary of Risk Factors\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in our other filings with the SEC or those that are presently unforeseen or that we currently believe to be immaterial could result in significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Summary of Risk Factors.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDifferences between actual experience and actuarial assumptions and the effectiveness of our actuarial models may adversely affect our financial results, capitalization and financial condition\nOur earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our actual claims experience and benefit payments on our products are consistent with the assumptions we use in setting prices for our products and establishing liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Such amounts are established based on actuarial estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. To the extent that actual claims and benefits experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in establishing such liabilities, we could be required to increase our liabilities. We make assumptions regarding policyholder behavior at the time of pricing and in selecting and utilizing the guaranteed options inherent within our products based in part upon expected persistency of the products, which change the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force from one period to the next. Persistency could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including adverse economic conditions, as well as by developments affecting policyholder perception of us, including perceptions arising from adverse publicity or any potential negative rating agency actions. The pricing of certain of our variable annuity products that contain certain living benefit guarantees is also based on assumptions about utilization rates, or the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration, including the timing of the first withdrawal. Results may vary based on differences between actual and expected benefit utilization. A material increase in the valuation of the liability could result to the extent that emerging and actual experience deviates from these policyholder option utilization assumptions, and in certain circumstances this deviation may impair our solvency. We conduct an annual actuarial review (the \u201cAAR\u201d) of the key inputs into our actuarial models that rely on management judgment and update those where we have credible evidence from actual experience, industry data or other relevant sources to ensure our price-setting criteria and reserve valuation practices continue to be appropriate.\nWe use actuarial models to assist us in establishing reserves for liabilities arising from our insurance policies and annuity contracts. We periodically review the effectiveness of these models, their underlying logic and, from time to time, implement refinements to our models based on these reviews. We implement refinements after rigorous testing and validation and, even after such validation and testing, our models remain subject to inherent limitations. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to whether or when we will implement refinements to our actuarial models, and, if implemented, the extent of such refinements. Furthermore, if implemented, any such refinements could cause us to increase the reserves we hold for our insurance policy and annuity contract liabilities. Such refinement would also cause us to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d) associated with the affected reserves.\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle these liabilities. Such amounts may vary materially from the estimated amounts, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on accounting requirements (which change from time to time), the assumptions and models used to establish the liabilities, as well as our actual experience. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments and claims prove inadequate, we will be required to increase them.\nAn increase in our reserves or acceleration of DAC amortization for any of the above reasons, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our profitability measures, as well as materially impact our capitalization, our distributable earnings, our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and BRCD and our liquidity. These impacts could then, in turn, impact our RBC ratios and our\nfinancial strength ratings, which are necessary to support our product sales, and, in certain circumstances, ultimately impact our solvency.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs.\u201d\nGuarantees within certain of our annuity products may decrease our earnings, decrease our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk\nCertain of the variable annuity products we offer include guaranteed benefits designed to protect contract holders against significant changes in equity markets and interest rates, including GMDBs, GMWBs and GMABs. While we continue to have GMIBs in-force with respect to which we are obligated to perform, we no longer offer GMIBs. We hold liabilities based on the value of the benefits we expect to be payable under such guarantees in excess of the contract holders\u2019 projected account balances. As a result, any periods of significant and sustained negative or low separate account returns, increased equity volatility, or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of our liabilities associated with variable annuity guarantees.\nAdditionally, we make assumptions regarding policyholder behavior at the time of pricing and in selecting and utilizing the guaranteed options inherent within our products (e.g., utilization of option to annuitize within a GMIB product). An increase in the valuation of the liability could result to the extent emerging and actual experience deviates from these policyholder persistency and option utilization assumptions. We review key actuarial assumptions used to record our variable annuity liabilities on an annual basis, including the assumptions regarding policyholder behavior. Changes to assumptions based on our AAR in future years could result in an increase in the liabilities we record for these guarantees.\nFurthermore, our Shield Annuities are index-linked annuities with guarantees for a defined amount of equity loss protection and upside participation. If the separate account assets consisting of fixed income securities are insufficient to support the increased liabilities resulting from a period of sustained growth in the equity index on which the product is based, we may be required to fund such separate accounts with additional assets from our general account, where we manage the equity risk as part of our overall variable annuity exposure risk management strategy. To the extent policyholder persistency is different than we anticipate in a sustained period of equity index growth, it could have an impact on our liquidity.\nAn increase in our variable annuity guarantee liabilities for any of the above reasons, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our profitability measures, as well as materially impact our capitalization, our distributable earnings, our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and our liquidity. These impacts could then in turn impact our RBC ratios and our financial strength ratings, which are necessary to support our product sales, and, in certain circumstances, ultimately impact our solvency.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management Strategies,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Annual Actuarial Review\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends and Uncertainties - Financial and Economic Environment.\u201d\nOur variable annuity exposure risk management strategy may not be effective, may result in significant volatility in our profitability measures and may negatively affect our statutory capital\nOur exposure risk management strategy seeks to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in capital markets, specifically equity markets and interest rates. The strategy primarily relies on a hedging strategy using derivative instruments and, to a lesser extent, reinsurance. We utilize a combination of short-term and longer-term derivative instruments to have a laddered maturity of protection and reduce roll-over risk during periods of market disruption or higher volatility.\nHowever, our hedging strategy may not be fully effective. In connection with our exposure risk management program, we may determine to seek the approval of applicable regulatory authorities to permit us to increase our hedge limits consistent with those contemplated by the program. No assurance can be given that any of our requested approvals will be obtained and even if obtained, any such approvals may be subject to qualifications, limitations or conditions. If our capital is depleted in the event of persistent market downturns, we may need to replenish it by contributing additional capital, which we may have allocated for other uses, or purchase additional or more expensive hedging protection. Under our hedging strategy, period to period changes in the valuation of our hedges relative to the guarantee liabilities may result in significant volatility to certain of our profitability measures, which could be more significant than has been the case historically, in certain circumstances.\nIn addition, hedging instruments we enter into may not effectively offset the costs of the guarantees within certain of our annuity products or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. For example, in the event that derivative counterparties or central clearinghouses are unable or unwilling to pay, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits. Furthermore, we are subject to the risk that changes in policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, could produce economic losses not addressed by the risk management techniques employed.\nFinally, the cost of our hedging program may be greater than anticipated because adverse market conditions can limit the availability, and increase the costs of, the derivatives we intend to employ, and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products we offer.\nThe above factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our profitability measures, as well as materially impact our capitalization, our distributable earnings, our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and BRCD and our liquidity. These impacts could then, in turn, impact our RBC ratios and our financial strength ratings, which are necessary to support our product sales, and, in certain circumstances, ultimately impact our solvency. See \u201cBusiness - Segments and Corporate & Other - Annuities - Current Products - Variable Annuities\u201d for further consideration of the risks associated with guaranteed benefits and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management Strategies - Variable Annuity Exposure Risk Management.\u201d\nOur analyses of scenarios and sensitivities that we may utilize in connection with our variable annuity risk management strategies may involve significant estimates based on assumptions and may, therefore, result in material differences from actual outcomes compared to the sensitivities calculated under such scenarios\nAs part of our variable annuity exposure risk management program, we may, from time to time, estimate the impact of various market factors under certain scenarios on our variable annuity distributable earnings, our reserves, or our capital (collectively, the \u201cmarket sensitivities\u201d).\nAny such market sensitivities may use inputs that are difficult to approximate and could include estimates that may differ materially from actual results. Any such estimates, or the absence thereof, may, among other things, be associated with: (i) basis returns related to equity or fixed income indices; (ii) actuarial assumptions related to policyholder behavior and life expectancy; and (iii) management actions that may occur in response to developing facts, circumstances and experience for which no estimates are made in any market sensitivities. Any such estimates, or the absence thereof, may produce sensitivities that could differ materially from actual outcomes and may therefore affect our actions in connection with our exposure risk management program.\nThe actual effect of changes in equity markets and interest rates on the assets supporting our variable annuity contracts and corresponding liabilities may vary materially from market sensitivities estimated due to a number of factors which may include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in our hedging program; (ii) actual policyholder behavior being different than assumed; and (iii) underlying fund performance being different than assumed. In addition, any market sensitivities are valid only as of a particular date and may not factor in the possibility of simultaneous shocks to equity markets, interest rates and market volatility. Furthermore, any market sensitivities could illustrate the estimated impact of the indicated shocks occurring instantaneously, and therefore may not give effect to rebalancing over the course of the shock event. The estimates of equity market shocks may reflect a shock of the same magnitude to both domestic and global equity markets, while the estimates of interest rate shocks may reflect a shock to rates at all durations (a parallel shift in the yield curve). Any such instantaneous or equilateral impact assumptions may result in estimated sensitivities that could differ materially from the actual impacts.\nFinally, no assurances can be given that the assumptions underlying any market sensitivities can or will be realized. Our liquidity, statutory capitalization, financial condition and results of operations could be affected by a broad range of capital market scenarios, which, if they adversely affect account values, could materially affect our reserving requirements, and by extension, could materially affect the accuracy of estimates used in any market sensitivities.\nWe may not have sufficient assets to meet our future ULSG policyholder obligations and changes in interest rates may result in net income volatility\nThe primary market risk associated with our ULSG block is the uncertainty around the future levels of U.S. interest rates and bond yields. To help ensure we have sufficient assets to meet future ULSG policyholder obligations, we have employed an actuarial approach based upon NY Regulation 126 Cash Flow Testing (\u201cULSG CFT\u201d) to set our ULSG asset requirement target for BRCD, which reinsures the majority of the ULSG business written by our insurance subsidiaries. For the business retained by our insurance subsidiaries, we set our ULSG asset requirement target to equal the actuarially determined statutory reserves, which, taken together with our ULSG asset requirement target for BRCD, comprises our total ULSG asset requirement target (\u201cULSG Target\u201d). Under the ULSG CFT approach, we assume that interest rates remain flat or lower than\ncurrent levels and our actuarial assumptions include a provision for adverse deviation. These underlying assumptions used in ULSG CFT are more conservative than those required under GAAP, which assumes a long-term upward mean reversion of interest rates and best estimate actuarial assumptions without additional provisions for adverse deviation.\nWe seek to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk associated with these liabilities by holding invested assets and interest rate derivatives to closely match our ULSG Target in different interest rate environments.\nOur ULSG Target is sensitive to the actual and future expected level of long-term U.S. interest rates. If interest rates fall, our ULSG Target will likely increase, and conversely, if interest rates rise, our ULSG Target will likely decline. As part of our macro interest rate hedging program, we primarily use interest rate swaps, swaptions and interest rate forwards to protect our statutory capitalization from increases in the ULSG Target in lower interest rate environments. This risk mitigation strategy may negatively impact our GAAP stockholders\u2019 equity and net income when interest rates rise and our ULSG Target likely declines, since our reported ULSG liabilities under GAAP are largely insensitive to actual fluctuations in interest rates. The ULSG liabilities under GAAP reflect changes in interest rates only when we revise our long-term assumptions due to sustained changes in the market interest rates, such as when we lowered our mean reversion rate from 3.75% to 3.00% in the third quarter of 2020 following our AAR.\nOur interest rate derivative instruments may not effectively offset the costs of our ULSG policyholder obligations or may otherwise be insufficient. In addition, this risk mitigation strategy may fail to adequately cover a scenario under which our obligations are higher than projected and may be required to sell investments to cover these increased obligations. If our liquid investments are depleted, we may need to sell higher-yielding, less liquid assets or take other actions, including utilizing contingent liquidity sources or raising capital. The above factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, our profitability measures as well as materially impact our capitalization, our distributable earnings, our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and BRCD and our liquidity. These impacts could in turn impact our RBC ratios and our financial strength ratings, which are necessary to support our product sales, and in certain circumstances could ultimately impact our solvency. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management Strategies - ULSG Market Risk Exposure Management.\u201d\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our capitalization and liquidity\nWe are closely monitoring developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already negatively impacted us in certain respects, including as discussed below and as further discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends and Uncertainties - COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d At this time, it is not possible to estimate the severity or duration of the pandemic, including the severity, duration and frequency of any additional \u201cwaves\u201d of the pandemic or the timetable for the implementation, and the efficacy, of any therapeutic treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, including their efficacy with respect to variants or mutations of COVID-19 that have emerged or could emerge in the future. It is likewise not possible to predict or estimate the longer-term effects of the pandemic, or any actions taken to contain or address the pandemic, on the economy at large and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the impact on our investment portfolio and our ratings, or the need for us in the future to revisit or revise targets previously provided to the markets or aspects of our business model. See \u201c- Extreme mortality events may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims.\u201d\nA key part of our operating strategy is leveraging third parties to deliver certain services important to our business. As a result, we rely upon the successful implementation and execution of the business continuity plans of such entities in the current environment. While our third-party provider contracts require business continuity and we closely monitor the performance of such third parties, including those that are operating in a remote work environment, successful implementation and execution of their business continuity strategies are largely outside of our control. If any of our third-party providers or partners (including third-party reinsurers) experience operational or financial failures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or are unable to perform any of their contractual obligations due to a force majeure or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \u201c- The failure of third parties to provide various services, or any failure of the practices and procedures that these third parties use to provide services to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u201d\nCertain sectors of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital markets and the global economy, as well as uncertainty regarding its duration and outcome. See \u201c- Investments-Related Risks - Defaults on our mortgage loans and volatility in performance may adversely affect our profitability,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends and Uncertainties - COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Investments - Current Environment - Selected Sector Investments,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Mortgage Loans - Loan Modifications Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit rating agencies may continue to review and adjust their ratings for the companies that they rate, including us. The credit rating agencies also evaluate the insurance industry as a whole and may change our credit rating based on their overall view of our industry. For example, in April 2020, Fitch revised the rating outlook for BHF and certain of its subsidiaries to negative from stable due to the disruption to economic activity and the financial markets from the COVID-19 pandemic. See \u201c- A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Rating Agencies.\u201d\nIncreased economic uncertainty and increased unemployment resulting from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have also impacted sales of certain of our products and have prompted us to take actions to provide relief to customers adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as further described in \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation.\u201d Circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the incidence of claims, utilization of benefits, lapses or surrenders of policies and payments on insurance premiums, any of which could impact the revenues and expenses associated with our products.\nAny risk management or contingency plans or preventative measures we take may not adequately predict or address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Currently, our employees are working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could increase operational risk, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risks, and could impair our ability to manage our business.\nThe U.S. federal government and many state legislatures and insurance regulators have passed legislation and regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that affect the conduct of our business. Changes in our circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic could subject us to additional legal and regulatory restrictions under existing laws and regulations, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Future legal and regulatory responses could also materially affect the conduct of our business going forward, as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may adversely affect our financial statements\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or interpretations issued by the FASB. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe FASB issued an accounting standards update (\u201cASU\u201d) in August 2018 that will result in significant changes to the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts, including that all of our variable annuity guarantees be considered market risk benefits and measured at fair value, whereas today a significant amount of our variable annuity guarantees are classified as insurance liabilities. The ASU will be effective as of January 1, 2023. The impact of the new guidance on our variable annuity guarantees is highly dependent on market conditions, especially interest rates, as our stockholders\u2019 equity would decrease as interest rates decrease and increase as interest rates rise. We are, therefore, unable to estimate the ultimate impact of the ASU on our financial statements; however, at current market interest rate levels, the ASU would ultimately result in a material decrease in our stockholders\u2019 equity, which could have a material adverse effect on our leverage ratios and other rating agency metrics and could consequently adversely impact our financial strength ratings and our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, the ASU could also result in increased market sensitivity of our financial statements and results of operations. See \u201c- A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\nFinancial strength ratings are published by various nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d) and similar entities not formally recognized as NRSROs. They indicate the NRSROs\u2019 opinions regarding an insurance company\u2019s ability to meet contract holder and policyholder obligations and are important to maintaining public confidence in our products and our competitive position. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Rating Agencies\u201d for additional information regarding our financial strength ratings, including current rating agency ratings and outlooks. Credit ratings are opinions of each agency\nwith respect to specific securities and contractual financial obligations of an issuer and the issuer\u2019s ability and willingness to meet those obligations when due. They are important factors in our overall financial profile, including funding profiles, and our ability to access certain types of liquidity.\nDowngrades in our financial strength ratings or credit ratings or changes to our ratings outlooks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including:\n\u2022reducing new sales of insurance products and annuity products;\n\u2022limiting our access to distributors;\n\u2022adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries;\n\u2022restricting our ability to generate new sales, as our products depend on strong financial strength ratings to compete effectively;\n\u2022increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contract holders and policyholders;\n\u2022requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive;\n\u2022providing termination rights for the benefit of our derivative instrument counterparties;\n\u2022providing termination rights to cedents under assumed reinsurance contracts;\n\u2022adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices, if at all;\n\u2022subjecting us to potentially increased regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022limiting our access to capital markets or other contingency funding sources; and\n\u2022potentially increasing our cost of capital, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nCredit rating agencies may continue to review and adjust their ratings for the companies that they rate, including us. The credit rating agencies also evaluate the insurance industry as a whole and may change our credit rating based on their overall view of our industry. For example, in April 2020, Fitch revised the rating outlook for BHF and certain of its subsidiaries to negative from stable due to the disruption to economic activity and the financial markets from the COVID-19 pandemic. This action by Fitch followed its revision of the rating outlook on the U.S. life insurance industry to negative. There can be no assurance that Fitch will not take further adverse action with respect to our ratings or that other rating agencies will not take similar actions in the future. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Rating Agencies.\u201d\nThe terms of our indebtedness could restrict our operations and use of funds, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nWe had approximately $3.4 billion of total long-term consolidated indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2020, consisting of debt securities issued to investors. We are required to service this indebtedness with cash at BHF and with dividends from our subsidiaries. The funds needed to service our indebtedness as well as to make required dividend payments on our outstanding preferred stock will not be available to meet any short-term liquidity needs we may have, invest in our business, pay any potential dividends on our common stock or carry out any share or debt repurchases that we may undertake.\nWe may not generate sufficient funds to service our indebtedness and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. In addition, our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy, in general. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Primary Sources of Liquidity and Capital\u201d for more details about our indebtedness. In addition, since the Tax Act limits the deductibility of interest expense, we may not be able to fully deduct the interest payments on a substantial portion of our indebtedness. Limitations on our operations and use of funds resulting from our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness, we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness and the holders of the defaulted indebtedness could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that indebtedness to be due and payable immediately.\nOur revolving credit facility and our reinsurance financing arrangement contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, including in certain cases requirements to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth and to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization not in excess of a specified percentage, as well as limitations on the dollar amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries, which could restrict our operations and use of funds. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company.\u201d Failure to comply with the covenants in our $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing May 7, 2024 (the \u201c2019 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) or fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, would restrict our ability to access the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Primary Sources of Liquidity and Capital - Credit and Committed Facilities\u201d for a discussion of our credit facilities, including the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our existing indebtedness, as well as any future indebtedness that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash to meet our debt obligations in the future is sensitive to capital market returns, primarily due to our variable annuity business. Overall, our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative, regulatory, client behavioral, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe lenders who hold our indebtedness could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. If we are not able to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including significant business and legal entity restructuring, limited new business investment, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the insurance industry could be impaired. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses\nAs part of our overall risk management strategy, our insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance from third-party reinsurers for certain risks we underwrite. While reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business. The premium rates and other fees that we charge for our products are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Some of our reinsurance contracts contain provisions that limit the reinsurer\u2019s ability to increase rates on in-force business; however, some do not. We have faced a number of rate increase actions on in-force business in recent years and may face additional increases in the future. There can be no assurance that the outcome of any future rate increase actions would not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If a reinsurer raises the rates that it charges on a block of in-force business, in some instances, we will not be able to pass the increased costs onto our customers and our profitability will be negatively impacted. Additionally, such a rate increase could result in our recapturing of the business, which would result in a need to maintain additional reserves, reduce reinsurance receivables and expose us to greater risks. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in an increase in the amount of risk that we retain with respect to those policies we issue. See \u201cBusiness - Reinsurance Activity.\u201d\nIf the counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements or to the derivatives we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\nWe use reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general, reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives do not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, indemnitors, counterparties and central clearinghouses. A reinsurer\u2019s, indemnitor\u2019s, counterparty\u2019s or central clearinghouse\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance agreements, indemnity agreements or derivatives agreements with us or inability or unwillingness to return collateral could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cede a large block of long-term care insurance business to certain affiliates of Genworth, which results in a significant concentration of reinsurance risk. The Genworth reinsurers\u2019 obligations to us are secured by trust accounts and Citigroup agreed to indemnify us for losses and certain other payment obligations we might incur with respect to this business. See \u201cBusiness - Reinsurance Activity - Unaffiliated Third-Party Reinsurance.\u201d Notwithstanding these arrangements, if the Genworth reinsurers become insolvent and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay their obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we use derivatives to hedge various business risks. We enter into a variety of OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Derivatives.\u201d If our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivatives, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. Such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to take credit for reinsurance, our statutory life insurance reserve financings may be subject to cost increases and new financings may be subject to limited market capacity\nWe currently utilize reinsurance and capital markets solutions to mitigate the capital impact of the statutory reserve requirements for several of our products, including, but not limited to, our level premium term life products subject to Regulation XXX and ULSG subject to Guideline AXXX. Our primary solution involves BRCD, our affiliated reinsurance subsidiary. See \u201cBusiness - Reinsurance Activity - Affiliated Reinsurance.\u201d BRCD obtained statutory reserve financing through a funding structure involving a single financing arrangement supported by a pool of highly rated third-party reinsurers. The financing facility matures in 2039, and therefore, we may need to refinance this facility in the future.\nThe NAIC adopted AG 48, which regulates the terms of captive insurer arrangements that are entered into or amended in certain ways after December 31, 2014. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Captive Reinsurer Regulation.\u201d There can be no assurance that in light of AG 48, future rules and regulations, or changes in interpretations by state insurance departments that we will be able to continue to efficiently implement these arrangements, nor can we assure you that future capacity for these arrangements will be available in the marketplace. To the extent we cannot continue to efficiently implement these arrangements, our statutory capitalization, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our competitiveness, could be adversely affected.\nFactors affecting our competitiveness may adversely affect our market share and profitability\nWe believe competition among insurance companies is based on a number of factors, including service, product features, scale, price, actual or perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. We face intense competition from a large number of other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims-paying ability and financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. In some circumstances, national banks that sell annuity products of life insurers may also have a pre-existing customer base for financial services products. These competitive pressures may adversely affect the persistency of our products, as well as our ability to sell our products in the future. In addition, new and disruptive technologies may present competitive risks. If, as a result of competitive factors or otherwise, we are unable to generate a sufficient return on insurance policies and annuity products we sell in the future, we may stop selling such policies and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d\nWe have limited control over many of our costs. For example, we have limited control over the cost of Unaffiliated Third-Party Reinsurance, the cost of meeting changing regulatory requirements, and our cost to access capital or financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain a cost advantage over our competitors. If our cost\nstructure increases and we are not able to achieve or maintain a cost advantage over our competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our strategy, as well as on our financial condition and results of operations. If we hold substantially more capital than is needed to support credit ratings that are commensurate with our business strategy, over time, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, since numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation, legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment for our business may have, over time, the effect of supporting or burdening some aspects of the financial services industry. This can affect our competitive position within the annuities and life insurance industry, and within the broader financial services industry. See \u201c- Regulatory and Legal Risks\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d\nWe may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our distribution channels\nWe distribute our products exclusively through a variety of third-party distribution channels. Our agreements with our third-party distributors may be terminated by either party with or without cause. We may periodically renegotiate the terms of these agreements, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If we are unable to maintain our relationships, our sales of individual insurance, annuities and investment products could decline, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our distributors may elect to suspend, alter, reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us for various reasons, including changes in our distribution strategy, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions, or concerns about market-related risks. We are also at risk that key distribution partners may merge, consolidate, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or that new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. Also, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key internal associates who conduct our business, including wholesalers, our sales could decline.\nAn interruption or significant change in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we rely on a core number of our distributors to produce the majority of our sales. If any one such distributor were to terminate its relationship with us, or reduce the amount of sales which it produces for us our results of operations could be adversely affected. An increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. Consolidation of distributors or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.\nBecause our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite our training and compliance programs. If our products are distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business.\nIn addition, our distributors may also sell our competitors\u2019 products. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do, these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors\u2019 products instead of ours. In connection with the sale of MPCG to MassMutual, we entered into an agreement in 2016 that permits us to serve as the exclusive manufacturer for certain proprietary products which are offered through MassMutual\u2019s career agent channel. We partnered with MassMutual to develop the initial product distributed under this arrangement, the Index Horizons fixed index annuity, and agreed on the terms of the related reinsurance. While the agreement has a term of 10 years, it is possible that MassMutual may terminate our exclusivity or the agreement itself in specified circumstances, such as our inability or failure to provide product designs that reasonably meet MassMutual requirements.\nThe failure of third parties to provide various services, or any failure of the practices and procedures that these third parties use to provide services to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business\nA key part of our operating strategy is to leverage third parties to deliver certain services important to our business, including administrative, operational, technology, financial, investment and actuarial services. For example, we have certain arrangements with third-party service providers relating to the administration of both in-force policies and new life and annuities business, as well as engagements with a select group of experienced external asset management firms to manage the investment of the assets comprising our general account portfolio and certain other assets. There can be no assurance that the services provided to us by third parties (or their suppliers, vendors or subcontractors) will be sufficient to meet our operational and business needs, that such third parties will continue to be able to perform their functions in a manner satisfactory to us, that the practices and procedures of such third parties will continue to enable them to adequately manage any processes they handle on our behalf, or that any remedies available under these third-party arrangements will be sufficient to us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance. In addition, we continue to focus on further sourcing\nopportunities with third-party vendors; as we transition to new third-party service providers and convert certain administrative systems or platforms, certain issues may arise. For example, during the third quarter of 2020, we completed the conversion of a significant portion of the administration of our in-force annuity business to a single third-party service provider. Following the conversion, a number of our customers and distribution partners experienced delays and service interruptions. While these issues have been largely resolved, there can be no assurance that in connection with this or future conversions, transitions to new third-party service providers, or in connection with any of the services provided to us by third parties (or such third party\u2019s supplier, vendor or subcontractor), we will not incur any unanticipated expenses or experience other economic or reputational harm, experience service delays or interruptions, or be subject to litigation or regulatory investigations and actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial reporting.\nFurthermore, if a third-party provider (or such third-party\u2019s supplier, vendor or subcontractor) fails to meet contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, suffers a cyberattack or other security breach, or fails to provide material information on a timely basis, then, in each case, we could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial reporting. In addition, such failures could result in the loss of key distributors, impact the accuracy of our financial reporting, or subject us to litigation or regulatory investigations and actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our distribution channels\u201d and \u201c- Operational Risks - Any failure in cyber- or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in Brighthouse\u2019s or our third-party service providers\u2019 disaster recovery systems and business continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\u201d\nSimilarly, if any third-party provider (or such third-party\u2019s supplier, vendor or subcontractor) experiences any deficiency in internal controls, determines that its practices and procedures used in providing services to us (including administering any of our policies or managing any of our investments) require review or it otherwise fails to provide services to us in accordance with appropriate standards, we could incur expenses and experience other adverse effects as a result. In such situations, we may be unable to resolve any issues on our own without assistance from the third-party provider, and we could have limited ability to influence the speed and effectiveness of that resolution.\nIn addition, from time to time, certain third parties have brought to our attention practices, procedures and reserves with respect to certain products they administer on our behalf that require further review. While we do not believe, based on the information made available to us to date, that any of the matters brought to our attention will require material modifications to reserves or have a material effect on our business and financial reporting, we are reliant on our third-party service providers to provide further information and assistance with respect to those products. There can also be no assurance that such matters will not require material modifications to reserves or have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future, or that our third-party service providers will provide further information and assistance.\nIt may be difficult, disruptive and more expensive for us to replace some of our third-party providers in a timely manner if in the future they were unwilling or unable to provide us with the services we require (as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise), and our business and financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if a third-party provider raises the rates that it charges us for its services, in some instances, we will not be able to pass the increased costs onto our customers and our profitability may be negatively impacted.\nChanges in our deferred income tax assets or liabilities, including changes in our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine whether they are realizable. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate future taxable income. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to our profitability measures. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the statutory tax rate could also affect the value of our deferred income tax assets and may require a write-off of some of those assets. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nAs a holding company, BHF depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends\nBHF is a holding company for its insurance subsidiaries and BRCD and does not have any significant operations of its own. We depend on the cash at the holding company as well as dividends or other capital inflows from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, if any. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Parent Company - Liquidity and Capital - Statutory Capital and Dividends.\u201d\nIf the cash BHF receives from its subsidiaries is insufficient for it to fund its debt-service and other holding company obligations, BHF may be required to raise capital through the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. Our ability to access funds through such methods is subject to prevailing market conditions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. See \u201c- Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks - Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital.\u201d\nThe payment of dividends and other distributions to BHF by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of dividends or other payments to BHF by its insurance subsidiaries if they determine that the payment could be adverse to the interests of our policyholders or contract holders. Any requested payment of dividends by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company and NELICO to BHF, or by BHNY to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, in excess of their respective ordinary dividend capacity would be considered an extraordinary dividend subject to prior approval by the Delaware Department of Insurance and the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, and the NYDFS, respectively. Furthermore, any dividends by BRCD are subject to the approval of the Delaware Department of Insurance. The payment of dividends and other distributions by our insurance subsidiaries is also influenced by business conditions including those described in the Risk Factors above and rating agency considerations. See \u201c- Regulatory and Legal Risks - A decrease in the RBC ratio (as a result of a reduction in statutory surplus or increase in RBC requirements) of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and rating agencies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\u201d See also \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Parent Company - Liquidity and Capital - Statutory Capital and Dividends.\u201d\nExtreme mortality events may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims\nOur life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and several significant influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century. The likelihood, timing, and severity of a future pandemic that may impact our policyholders cannot be predicted. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy and the financial markets or the economies of particular countries or regions, including disruptions to commerce, the health system, and the food supply and reduced economic activity. In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors or of other companies with which we do business, including providers of third-party services, could disrupt our business operations. Furthermore, the value of our investment portfolio could be negatively impacted, see \u201c- Investments-Related Risks - The continued threat of terrorism, ongoing military actions as well as other catastrophic events may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the level of claim losses we incur.\u201d The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses we experience. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. A catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, improvements in medical care and other developments which positively affect life expectancy can cause our assumptions with respect to longevity, which we use when we price our products, to become incorrect and, accordingly, can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could face difficulties, unforeseen liabilities, asset impairments or rating actions arising from business acquisitions or dispositions\nWe may engage in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses. Such activity exposes us to a number of risks arising from (i) potential difficulties achieving projected financial results including the costs and benefits of integration or deconsolidation; (ii) unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments; (iii) the scope and duration of rights to indemnification for losses; (iv) the use of capital which could be used for other purposes; (v) rating agency reactions; (vi) regulatory requirements that could impact our operations or capital requirements; (vii) changes in statutory accounting principles or GAAP, practices or policies; and (viii) certain other risks specifically arising from activities relating to a legal entity reorganization.\nOur ability to achieve certain financial benefits we anticipate from any acquisitions of businesses will depend in part upon our ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an efficient and effective manner. There may be liabilities or asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing acquisition-related due diligence investigations. Furthermore, even for obligations and liabilities that we do discover during the due diligence process, neither the valuation adjustment nor the contractual protections we negotiate may be sufficient to fully protect us from losses.\nWe may from time to time dispose of business or blocks of in-force business through outright sales, reinsurance transactions or by alternate means. After a disposition, we may remain liable to the acquirer or to third parties for certain losses or costs arising from the divested business or on other bases. We may also not realize the anticipated profit on a disposition or incur a loss on the disposition. In anticipation of any disposition, we may need to restructure our operations, which could disrupt such operations and affect our ability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow such business pending the completion of such transaction. In addition, the actions of key employees of the business to be divested could adversely affect the success of such disposition as they may be more focused on obtaining employment, or the terms of their employment, than on maximizing the value of the business to be divested. Furthermore, transition services or tax arrangements related to any such separation could further disrupt our operations and may impose restrictions, liabilities, losses or indemnification obligations on us. Depending on its particulars, a separation could increase our exposure to certain risks, such as by decreasing the diversification of our sources of revenue. Moreover, we may be unable to timely dissolve all contractual relationships with the divested business in the course of the proposed transaction, which may materially adversely affect our ability to realize value from the disposition. Such restructuring could also adversely affect our internal controls and procedures and impair our relationships with key customers, distributors and suppliers. An interruption or significant change in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks\nIf difficult conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally persist or are perceived to persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally, as well as by the global economy to the extent it affects the U.S. economy. In addition, while our operations are entirely in the U.S., we have foreign investments in our general and separate accounts and, accordingly, conditions in the global capital markets can affect the value of our general account and separate account assets, as well as our financial results. Actual or perceived stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in financial asset classes or various capital markets can have an adverse effect on us, both because we have a large investment portfolio and our benefit and claim liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices, derivative prices and availability, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates and the returns and volatility and the returns of capital markets. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our products could be adversely affected as customers are unwilling or unable to purchase them. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations and lapses or surrenders of policies. Furthermore, our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Such adverse changes in the economy could negatively affect our earnings and capitalization and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, both market and economic factors may affect our business results as well as our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and BRCD and meet our obligations at our holding company and our liquidity.\nSignificant market volatility in reaction to geopolitical risks, changing monetary policy, trade disputes and uncertain fiscal policy may exacerbate some of the risks we face. Increased market volatility may affect the performance of the various asset classes in which we invest, as well as separate account values. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Current Environment\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends and Uncertainties - Financial and Economic Environment.\u201d\nExtreme declines or shocks in equity markets, such as sustained stagnation in equity markets and low interest rates, could cause us to incur significant capital or operating losses due to, among other reasons, the impact on us of guarantees related to our annuity products, including increases in liabilities, increased capital requirements, or collateral requirements. Furthermore, periods of sustained stagnation in equity and bond markets, which are characterized by multiple years of low annualized total returns impacting the growth in separate accounts or low level of U.S. interest rates, may materially increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits due to inherent market return guarantees in these liabilities. Similarly, sustained periods of low interest rates and risk asset returns could reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities\nfor claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures such as hedging, causing our profit margins to erode as a result of reduced income from our investment portfolio and increase in insurance liabilities. See also \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - Guarantees within certain of our annuity products may decrease our earnings, decrease our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk\u201d and \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our capitalization and liquidity.\u201d\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital\nThe capital and credit markets may be subject to periods of extreme volatility. Disruptions in capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity and credit capacity or limit our access to capital which may in the future be needed to operate our business and meet policyholder obligations.\nWe need liquidity at our holding company to pay our operating expenses, pay interest on our indebtedness, carry out any share or debt repurchases that we may undertake, pay any potential dividends on our stock, provide our subsidiaries with cash or collateral, maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations and limit the investments necessary to grow our business.\nFor our insurance subsidiaries, the principal sources of liquidity are insurance premiums and fees paid in connection with annuity products, and cash flow from our investment portfolio to the extent consisting of cash and readily marketable securities.\nIn the event capital market or other conditions have an adverse impact on our capital and liquidity, or our stress-testing indicates that such conditions could have an adverse impact beyond expectations and our current resources do not satisfy our needs or regulatory requirements, we may have to seek additional financing to enhance our capital and liquidity position. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as the then current market conditions, regulatory capital requirements, availability of credit to us and the financial services industry generally, our credit ratings and financial leverage, and the perception of our customers and lenders regarding our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large operating or investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, our liquidity requirements may change if, among other things, we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending agreements or other collateral requirements. See \u201c- Investments-Related Risks - Should the need arise, we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or in our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given that not all assets are liquid,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - Collateral for Securities Lending and Derivatives\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Liquidity.\u201d\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets, as such disruptions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements, and access the capital that may be necessary to grow our business. See \u201c- Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\u201d As a result, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of securities than we would have otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risks which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, and may cause our net investment income and our profitability measures to vary from period to period\nWe are exposed to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global capital and credit markets, including changes and volatility in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, real estate, foreign currency, commodity prices, performance of the obligors included in our investment portfolio (including governments), derivatives (including performance of our derivatives counterparties) and other factors outside our control. We may be exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market downturn or market volatility.\nCredit spread risk\nOur exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price volatility and investment risk associated with the fluctuation in credit spreads. Widening credit spreads may cause unrealized losses in our investment portfolio and increase losses associated with written credit protection derivatives used in replication transactions. Increases in credit spreads of issuers due to credit deterioration may result in higher level of impairments. Additionally, an increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks can also adversely affect the cost of our borrowing if we need to access credit markets. Tightening credit spreads may reduce our investment income and cause an increase in the reported value of certain liabilities that are valued using a discount rate that reflects our own credit spread.\nInterest rate risk\nSome of our current or anticipated future products, principally traditional life, universal life and fixed, index-linked and income annuities, as well as funding agreements and structured settlements, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or \u201cnet investment spread,\u201d or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we earn on general account investments intended to support the obligations under such contracts. Our net investment spread is a key component of our profitability measures.\nIn a low interest rate environment, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, which will reduce our net investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and commercial, agricultural or residential mortgage loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, thereby exacerbating this risk. Although reducing interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in net investment spreads on some products, our ability to reduce these rates is limited to the portion of our in-force product portfolio that has adjustable interest crediting rates and could be limited by the actions of our competitors or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our net investment spread would decrease or potentially become negative, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities.\u201d\nOur estimation of future net investment spreads is an important component in the amortization of DAC. Significantly lower than anticipated net investment spreads can reduce our profitability measures and may cause us to accelerate amortization, which would result in a reduction of net income in the affected reporting period and potentially negatively affect our credit instrument covenants or the rating agencies\u2019 assessment of our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of declining interest rates, our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations may decrease. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, our reserves for policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened. Accordingly, declining and sustained lower interest rates may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and BRCD and significantly reduce our profitability.\nIncreases in interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher-yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest rate sensitive products competitive. Therefore, we may have to accept a lower credit spread and lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, as interest rates rise, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals, terminations and substantial policy amendments may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC; such events may reduce our profitability measures and potentially negatively affect our credit instrument covenants and the rating agencies\u2019 assessments of our financial condition and results of operations. An increase in interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans that comprise a significant portion of our investment portfolio. See \u201c- Investments-Related Risks - Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities and defaults, downgrades or other events may result in future impairments to the carrying value of such securities, resulting in a reduction in our profitability measures.\u201d Finally, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee revenue associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\nIn addition, because the macro interest rate hedging program is primarily a risk mitigation strategy intended to reduce our risk to statutory capitalization and long-term economic exposures from sustained low levels of interest rates, this\nstrategy will likely result in higher net income volatility due to the insensitivity of related GAAP liabilities to the change in interest rate levels. This strategy may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - We may not have sufficient assets to meet our future ULSG policyholder obligations and changes in interest rates may result in net income volatility\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management Strategies - ULSG Market Risk Exposure Management.\u201d\nFurthermore, an increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments may fall, which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses, potentially putting pressure on profitability in the event that such additional costs cannot be passed through. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity and inhibit revenue growth.\nChanges to LIBOR\nThere is currently uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and any financial instruments or agreements currently using LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate may be adversely affected. As a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of LIBOR, actions by regulators, law enforcement agencies or the ICE Benchmark Administration, the current administrator of LIBOR may enact changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined. In July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021, which was expected to result in these widely used reference rates no longer being available. As a result, the Federal Reserve began publishing a secured overnight funding rate, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. On November 30, 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced that only the one week and the two-month USD LIBOR settings would cease publication on December 31, 2020, while the remaining tenors will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. Regulators in the US and globally have continued to push for market participants to transition away from the use of LIBOR and have urged market participants to not enter into new contracts that reference USD LIBOR after December 31, 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict how such changes or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities and derivatives, including those held in our investment portfolio. Such changes or reforms may result in adjustments or replacements to LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Furthermore, we previously entered into agreements that currently reference LIBOR and may be adversely affected by any changes or reforms to LIBOR or discontinuation of LIBOR, including if such agreements are not amended prior to any such changes, reform or discontinuation.\nEquity risk\nOur primary exposure to equity relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our businesses where fee income is earned based upon the estimated market value of the separate account assets and other assets related to our variable annuity business. Because fees generated by such products are primarily related to the value of the separate account assets and other AUM, a decline in the equity markets could reduce our revenues as a result of the reduction in the value of the investment assets supporting those products and services. We seek to mitigate the impact of such exposure to weak or stagnant equity markets through the use of derivatives, reinsurance and capital management. However, such derivatives and reinsurance may become less available and, if they remain available, their price could materially increase in a period characterized by volatile equity markets. The risk of stagnation in equity market returns cannot be addressed by hedging. See \u201cBusiness - Segments and Corporate & Other - Annuities - Current Products - Variable Annuities\u201d for details regarding sensitivity of our variable annuity business to capital markets.\nIn addition, a portion of our investments are in leveraged buy-out funds and other private equity funds. The amount and timing of net investment income from such funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments. As a result, the amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period. Significant volatility could adversely impact returns and net investment income on these investments. In addition, the estimated fair value of such investments may be affected by downturns or volatility in equity or other markets.\nSee \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - Guarantees within certain of our annuity products may decrease our earnings, decrease our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk\u201d and \u201c- Investments-Related Risks - Our valuation of securities and investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\u201d\nReal estate risk\nA portion of our investment portfolio consists of mortgage loans on commercial, agricultural and residential real estate. Our exposure to this risk stems from various factors, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility, interest rate fluctuations, agricultural prices and farm incomes. Although we manage credit risk and market valuation risk for our commercial, agricultural and residential real estate assets through geographic, property type and product type diversification and asset allocation, general economic conditions in the commercial, agricultural and residential real estate sectors will continue to influence the performance of these investments. These factors, which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nObligor-related risk\nFixed income securities and mortgage loans represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within asset-backed securities (\u201cABS\u201d), including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening mortgage or credit spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers, guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities and mortgage loans could cause the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and our earnings to decline and the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio to increase.\nDerivatives risk\nOur derivatives counterparties\u2019 defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Substantially all of our derivatives (whether entered into bilaterally with specific counterparties or cleared through a clearinghouse) require us to pledge or receive collateral or make payments related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives. In addition, ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of derivative counterparties may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the affected businesses. Furthermore, the valuation of our derivatives could change based on changes to our valuation methodology or the discovery of errors.\nSummary\nEconomic or counterparty risks and other factors described above, and significant volatility in the markets, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses, derivative losses, change in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves for future policyholder benefits, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.\nMarket price volatility can also make it difficult to value certain assets in our investment portfolio if trading in such assets becomes less frequent, for example, as was the case during the 2008 financial crisis. In such case, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could require additional reserves. Significant volatility in the markets could cause changes in the credit spreads and defaults and a lack of pricing transparency which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Investment Risks.\u201d\nInvestments-Related Risks\nShould the need arise, we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or in our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given that not all assets are liquid\nThere may be a limited market for certain investments we hold in our investment portfolio, making them relatively illiquid. These include privately-placed fixed maturity securities, derivative instruments such as options, mortgage loans, policy loans, leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests, and real estate equity, such as real estate limited partnerships, limited liability companies and funds. In the past, even some of our very high-quality investments experienced reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption. If we were forced to sell certain of our investments during periods of market volatility or disruption, market prices may be lower than our carrying value in such investments. This could result in realized losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our financial ratios, which could affect compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy\nmeasures. Moreover, our ability to sell assets could be limited if other market participants are seeking to sell fungible or similar assets at the same time.\nSimilarly, we loan blocks of our securities to third parties (primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks) through our securities lending program, including fixed maturity securities and short-term investments.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Securities Lending\u201d for a discussion of our obligations under our securities lending program. If we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral in connection with our securities lending or otherwise need significant amounts of cash on short notice and we are forced to sell securities, we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize in normal market conditions, or both. In the event of a forced sale, accounting guidance requires the recognition of a loss for securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities based on our ability to hold those securities, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our financial ratios, which could affect compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures. In addition, under stressful capital market and economic conditions, liquidity broadly deteriorates, which could further restrict our ability to sell securities. Furthermore, if we decrease the amount of our securities lending activities over time, the amount of net investment income generated by these activities will also likely decline.\nOur requirements to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in estimated fair value of derivatives transactions or specified assets in connection with OTC-cleared, OTC-bilateral transactions and exchange traded derivatives may adversely affect our liquidity, expose us to central clearinghouse and counterparty credit risk, or increase our costs of hedging\nMany of our derivatives transactions require us to pledge collateral related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives transactions executed through a specific broker at a clearinghouse or entered into with a specific counterparty on a bilateral basis. The amount of collateral we may be required to pledge and the payments we may be required to make under our derivatives transactions may increase under certain circumstances as a result of the requirement to pledge initial margin for OTC-bilateral transactions entered into after the phase-in period, which we expect to be applicable to us in September 2021 as a result of the adoption by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Farm Credit Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission of final margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. Such requirements could adversely affect our liquidity, expose us to central clearinghouse and counterparty credit risk, or increase our costs of hedging. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives.\u201d\nGross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities and defaults, downgrades or other events may result in future impairments to the carrying value of such securities, resulting in a reduction in our profitability measures\nFixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d) and are, therefore, excluded from our profitability measures. In recent periods, as a result of low interest rates, the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity securities have exceeded the unrealized losses. However, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains would decrease, and our unrealized losses would increase, perhaps substantially. The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these AFS securities is recognized in our profitability measures when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be credit-related and impairment charges to earnings are taken. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS.\u201d\nThe occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d), commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d) and ABS (collectively, \u201cStructured Securities\u201d) could cause the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and corresponding earnings to decline and cause the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect. Economic uncertainty can adversely affect credit quality of issuers or guarantors. Similarly, a ratings downgrade affecting a security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated and could increase the capital we must hold to support that security to maintain our RBC levels. Our intent to sell or assessment of the likelihood that we would be required to sell fixed maturity securities that have declined in value may affect the level of write-downs or impairments. Realized losses or impairments on these securities\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in, or at the end of, any quarterly or annual period.\nOur valuation of securities and investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations\nFixed maturity and equity securities, as well as short-term investments that are reported at estimated fair value, represent the majority of our total cash and investments. See Note 1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on how we calculate fair value. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In addition, in times of financial market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. In those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and management judgment. Valuations may result in estimated fair values which vary significantly from the amount at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly. Decreases in the estimated fair value of securities we hold could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. However, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances and any such future impairments or allowances could have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and financial position.\nDefaults on our mortgage loans and volatility in performance may adversely affect our profitability\nOur mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments or fluctuations in their performance, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, any geographic or property type concentration of our mortgage loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolio and consequently on our financial condition and results of operations. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments - Mortgage Loans\u201d and Notes 6 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe defaults or deteriorating credit of other financial institutions could adversely affect us\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and investment funds and other financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of the default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities, derivatives, joint ventures and equity investments. Any losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued threat of terrorism, ongoing military actions as well as other catastrophic events may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the level of claim losses we incur\nThe continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, as well as other natural or man-made catastrophic events, may cause significant decline and volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce, the health system, and the food supply and reduced economic activity. The value of assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of catastrophic events. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Catastrophic events could also disrupt our operations as well as\nthe operations of our third-party service providers and also result in higher than anticipated claims under insurance policies that we have issued. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities.\u201d\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOur insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth\nOur operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. Our insurance subsidiaries and BRCD are subject to regulation by their primary Delaware, Massachusetts and New York state regulators as well as other regulation in states in which they operate. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation,\u201d as supplemented by discussions of regulatory developments in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends and Uncertainties - Regulatory Developments.\u201d\nWe cannot predict what proposals may be made, what legislation or regulations may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any future legislation or regulations could have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty could create confusion among our distribution partners and customers, which could negatively impact product sales. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Standard of Conduct Regulation\u201d for a more detailed discussion of particular regulatory efforts by various regulators.\nChanges to the laws and regulations that govern the standards of conduct that apply to the sale of our variable and registered fixed insurance products business and the firms that distribute these products could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Such changes could increase our regulatory and compliance burden, resulting in increased costs, or limit the type, amount or structure of compensation arrangements into which we may enter with certain of our associates, which could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting and retaining key personnel. Additionally, our ability to react to rapidly changing economic conditions and the dynamic, competitive market for variable and registered fixed products will depend on the continued efficacy of provisions we have incorporated into our product design allowing frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements, as well as our ability to work collaboratively with securities regulators. Changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could adversely impact our ability to react to such changing conditions.\nRevisions to the NAIC\u2019s RBC calculation, including further changes to the VA Reform framework, could result in a reduction in the RBC ratio for one or more of our insurance subsidiaries below certain prescribed levels, and in case of such a reduction we may be required to hold additional capital in such subsidiary or subsidiaries. See \u201c- A decrease in the RBC ratio (as a result of a reduction in statutory surplus or increase in RBC requirements) of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and rating agencies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based Capital.\u201d\nWe cannot predict the impact that \u201cbest interest\u201d or fiduciary standards recently adopted or proposed by various regulators may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with new or changed rules or legislation in this area may increase our regulatory burden and that of our distribution partners, require changes to our compensation practices and product offerings, and increase litigation risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we cannot predict the impact of the DOL\u2019s Fiduciary Advice Rule that became effective on February 16, 2021, including the DOL\u2019s guidance broadening the scope of what constitutes fiduciary \u201cinvestment advice\u201d under ERISA and the Tax Code. The DOL\u2019s interpretation of the ERISA fiduciary investment advice regulation could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products through our independent distribution partners, as a significant portion of our annuity sales are to IRAs. The Fiduciary Advice Rule may also lead to changes to our compensation practices, product offerings and increased litigation risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may also need to take certain additional actions in order to comply with, or assist our distributors in their compliance with, the Fiduciary Advice Rule.\nChanges in laws and regulations that affect our customers and distribution partners or their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Such actions may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our associates fail to adhere to regulatory requirements or our policies and procedures, we may be subject to penalties, restrictions or other sanctions by applicable regulators, and we may suffer reputational harm. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d\nA decrease in the RBC ratio (as a result of a reduction in statutory surplus or increase in RBC requirements) of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and rating agencies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nThe NAIC has established model regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for insurance companies. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to RBC standards or other minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of domicile. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based Capital.\u201d\nIn any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by the insurance subsidiary (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital such insurer must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value and credit ratings of certain fixed income and equity securities in its investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments that do not receive hedge accounting and changes in interest rates, as well as changes to the RBC formulas and the interpretation of the NAIC\u2019s instructions with respect to RBC calculation methodologies. Our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their own internal models, which differ from the RBC capital model, that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our insurance subsidiaries should hold relative to the rating agencies\u2019 expectations. Under stressed or stagnant capital market conditions and with the aging of existing insurance liabilities, without offsets from new business, the amount of additional statutory reserves that an insurance subsidiary is required to hold may materially increase. This increase in reserves would decrease the statutory surplus available for use in calculating the subsidiary\u2019s RBC ratio. To the extent that an insurance subsidiary\u2019s RBC ratio is deemed to be insufficient, we may seek to take actions either to increase the capitalization of the insurer or to reduce the capitalization requirements. If we were unable to accomplish such actions, the rating agencies may view this as a reason for a ratings downgrade.\nThe failure of any of our insurance subsidiaries to meet their applicable RBC requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject them to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on their ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A decline in RBC ratios, whether or not it results in a failure to meet applicable RBC requirements, may limit the ability of an insurance subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions to us, could result in a loss of customers or new business, or could be a factor in causing ratings agencies to downgrade our financial strength ratings, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state securities laws and regulations and rules of self-regulatory organizations which, among other things, require that we distribute certain of our products through a registered broker-dealer; failure to comply with these laws or changes to these laws could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our profitability\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that are also \u201csecurities,\u201d including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, to the separate accounts that issue them, and to certain fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts. Such laws and regulations require these products to be distributed through a broker-dealer that is registered with the SEC and certain state securities regulators and is also a member of FINRA. Accordingly, by offering and selling these registered products, and in managing certain proprietary mutual funds associated with those products, we are subject to, and bear the costs of compliance with, extensive regulation under federal and state securities laws, as well as FINRA rules.\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets, protect investment advisory and brokerage clients, and ensure the integrity of the financial markets. These laws and regulations generally grant regulatory and self-regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers impacting new and existing products. These powers include the power to adopt new rules to regulate the issuance, sale and distribution of our products and powers to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with securities laws and regulations. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Advisor Regulation.\u201d\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 led to significant changes in economic and financial markets that have, in turn, led to a dynamic competitive landscape for issuers of variable and registered insurance products. Our ability to react to rapidly changing market and economic conditions will depend on the continued efficacy of provisions we have incorporated into our product design allowing frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements and our ability to work\ncollaboratively with federal securities regulators. Changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could adversely impact our ability to react to such changing conditions.\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could reduce our earnings and materially impact our operations by increasing our corporate taxes and making some of our products less attractive to consumers\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition and could result in our incurring materially higher statutory taxes. Higher tax rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Conversely, declines in tax rates could make our products less attractive to consumers.\nWhen most of the changes introduced by the Tax Act went into effect on January 1, 2018, it resulted in sweeping changes to the Tax Code. The Tax Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21%, limited deductibility of interest expense, increased capitalization amounts for DAC, eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax, provided for determining reserve deductions as 92.81% of statutory reserves, and reduced the dividends received deduction.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations are common in our businesses and may result in significant financial losses or harm to our reputation\nWe face a significant risk of litigation actions and regulatory investigations in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our pending legal actions and regulatory investigations include proceedings specific to us, as well as other proceedings that raise issues that are generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. In addition, the Master Separation Agreement that sets forth our agreements with MetLife relating to the ownership of certain assets and the allocation of certain liabilities in connection with the Separation (the \u201cMaster Separation Agreement\u201d) allocated responsibility among MetLife and Brighthouse with respect to certain claims (including litigation or regulatory actions or investigations where Brighthouse is not a party). As a result, we may face indemnification obligations or be required to share in certain of MetLife\u2019s liabilities with respect to such claims.\nIn connection with our insurance operations, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, investments, denial or delay of benefits, cost of insurance and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may be difficult to ascertain. Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us and risks to our business presented by these proceedings, if any, are discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant legal costs and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, our ability to attract new customers and distributors, retain our current customers and distributors, and recruit and retain personnel could be materially and adversely impacted. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may also cause volatility in the price of BHF securities and the securities of companies in our industry.\nCurrent claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and other proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings in any of the jurisdictions where we operate could result in new legal actions and precedents or changes in laws, rules or regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nAny gaps in our policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business\nWe have developed policies and procedures to reflect the ongoing review of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not be fully effective, leaving us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks. In addition, we rely on third-party providers to administer and service many of our products, and our policies and procedures may not enable us to identify and assess every risk with respect to those products, especially to the\nextent we rely on those providers for detailed information regarding the holders of our products and other relevant information.\nMany of our methods for managing risk and exposures rely on assumptions that are based on observed historical financial and non-financial trends or projections of potential future exposure, and our assumptions and projections may be inaccurate. Business decisions based on incorrect or misused model output and reports could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If models are misused or fail to serve their intended purposes, they could produce incorrect or inappropriate results. Furthermore, models used by our business may not operate properly and could contain errors related to model inputs, data, assumptions, calculations, or output which could give rise to adjustments to models that may adversely impact our results of operations. As a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate.\nOther risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will follow our policies and procedures, nor can there be any assurance that our policies and procedures, or the policies and procedures of third parties that administer or service our products, will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit our exposures based on our assessments. In addition, we may have to implement more extensive and perhaps different policies and procedures under pending regulations. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business - Our variable annuity exposure risk management strategy may not be effective, may result in significant volatility in our profitability measures and may negatively affect our statutory capital.\u201d\nAny failure in cyber- or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in Brighthouse\u2019s or our third-party service providers\u2019 disaster recovery systems and business continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of computer systems. For some of these systems, we rely on third parties, such as our outside vendors and distributors. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions, including processing new business, claims, and post-issue transactions, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses, managing our investments and maintaining financial records. Such computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to a variety of forms of cyberattacks with the objective of gaining unauthorized access to our systems and data or disrupting our operations. These include, but are not limited to, phishing attacks, account takeover attempts, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, and other computer-related penetrations. Administrative and technical controls and other preventive actions taken to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks or other security breaches to such computer systems. In some cases, such physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks or other security breaches may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA disaster such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, cyberattack or war, unanticipated problems with our or our vendors\u2019 disaster recovery systems (and the disaster recovery systems of such vendors\u2019 suppliers, vendors or subcontractors), could cause our computer systems to be inaccessible to our employees, distributors, vendors or customers or may destroy valuable data. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our or our vendors\u2019 managers were unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide goods and services and our employees\u2019 ability to perform their job responsibilities. In addition, an extended period of remote work arrangements resulting from such interruptions could increase our operational risk, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risks, and could impair our ability to manage our business.\nA failure of our or relevant third-party (or such third-party\u2019s supplier\u2019s, vendor\u2019s or subcontractor\u2019s computer systems) computer systems could cause significant interruptions in our operations, result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and legal claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues, and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. Our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. See also \u201c- Any failure to protect the confidentiality of client and employee information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nOur associates and those of our third-party service providers may take excessive risks which could negatively affect our financial condition and business\nAs an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of accepting certain risks. The associates who conduct our business include executive officers and other members of management, sales intermediaries, investment professionals, product managers, and other associates, as well as associates of our various third-party service providers. Each of these associates makes decisions and choices that may expose us to risk. These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines and standards, product design and pricing, determining what assets to purchase for investment and when to sell them, which business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. Associates may take excessive risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. Similarly, our controls and procedures designed to monitor associates\u2019 business decisions and prevent them from taking excessive risks, and to prevent employee misconduct, may not be effective. If our associates and those of our third-party service providers take excessive risks, the impact of those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of client and employee information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nFederal and state legislatures and various government agencies have established laws and regulations protecting the privacy and security of personal information. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Cybersecurity Regulation.\u201d Our third-party service-providers and our employees have access to, and routinely process, personal information through a variety of media, including information technology systems. It is possible that an employee or third-party service provider (or their suppliers, vendors or subcontractors) could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential personal information, and there can be no assurance that our information security policies and systems in place can prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including nonpublic personal information. Additionally, our data has been the subject of cyberattacks and could be subject to additional attacks. If we or any of our third-party service providers (or their suppliers, vendors or subcontractors) fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our associates fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of employee or client information could occur. Any data breach or unlawful disclosure of confidential personal information could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c- Any failure in cyber- or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in Brighthouse\u2019s or our third-party service providers\u2019 disaster recovery systems and business continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\u201d In addition, compliance with complex variations in privacy and data security laws may require modifications to current business practices.\nFurthermore, there has been increased scrutiny as well as enacted and proposed additional regulation, including from state regulators, regarding the use of customer data. We may analyze customer data or input such data into third-party analytics in order to better manage our business. Any inquiry in connection with our analytics business practices, as well as any misuse or alleged misuse of those analytics insights, could cause reputational harm or result in regulatory enforcement actions or litigation, and any related limitations imposed on us could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Separation from, and Continuing Relationship with, MetLife\nIf the Separation were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax liabilities\nIn connection with the Separation, MetLife received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) regarding certain significant issues under the Tax Code, as well as an opinion from its tax advisor that, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Separation qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss to MetLife and MetLife\u2019s shareholders pursuant to Sections 355 and 361 of the Tax Code. Notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the tax opinion, the tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS could determine that the Separation should be treated as a taxable transaction and, as a result, we could incur significant federal income tax liabilities, and we could have an indemnification obligation to MetLife.\nGenerally, taxes resulting from the failure of the Separation to qualify for non-recognition treatment for federal income tax purposes would be imposed on MetLife or MetLife\u2019s shareholders. Under the tax separation agreement with MetLife, Inc. (the \u201cTax Separation Agreement\u201d), MetLife is generally obligated to indemnify us against such taxes if the failure to qualify for tax-free treatment results from, among other things, any action or inaction that is within MetLife\u2019s control. MetLife may dispute an indemnification obligation to us under the Tax Separation Agreement, and there can be no assurance that MetLife will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligation to us or that such indemnification will be sufficient for us in the event of\nnonperformance by MetLife. The failure of MetLife to fully indemnify us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, MetLife will generally bear tax-related losses due to the failure of certain steps that were part of the Separation to qualify for their intended tax treatment. However, the IRS could seek to hold us responsible for such liabilities, and under the Tax Separation Agreement, we could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify MetLife and its affiliates against certain tax-related liabilities caused by those failures. If the Separation does not qualify for non-recognition treatment or if certain other steps that are part of the Separation do not qualify for their intended tax treatment, we could be required to pay material additional taxes or be obligated to indemnify MetLife, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Separation was also subject to tax rules regarding the treatment of certain of our tax attributes (such as the basis in our assets). In certain circumstances such rules could require us to reduce those attributes, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. The ultimate tax consequences to us of the Separation may not be finally determined for many years and may differ from the tax consequences that we and MetLife expected at the time of the Separation. As a result, we could be required to pay material additional taxes and to materially reduce the tax assets (or materially increase the tax liabilities) on our consolidated balance sheet. These changes could impact our available capital, ratings or cost of capital. There can be no assurance that the Tax Separation Agreement will protect us from any such consequences, or that any issue that may arise will be subject to indemnification by MetLife under the Tax Separation Agreement. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDisputes or disagreements with MetLife may affect our financial statements and business operations, and our contractual remedies may not be sufficient\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with MetLife, including a transition services agreement, the Tax Separation Agreement and a tax receivables agreement that provides MetLife with the right to receive future payments from us as partial consideration for its contribution of assets to us. Disagreements regarding the obligations of MetLife or us under these agreements could create disputes that may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our shareholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that any remedies available under these agreements will be sufficient to us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance by MetLife. The failure of MetLife to perform its obligations under these agreements (or claims by MetLife that we have failed to perform our obligations under the agreements) may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Master Separation Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, we will indemnify, hold harmless and defend MetLife and certain related individuals from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain events relating to our business. We cannot predict whether any event triggering this indemnity will occur or the extent to which we may be obligated to indemnify MetLife or such related individuals. In addition, the Master Separation Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, MetLife will indemnify, hold harmless and defend us and certain related individuals from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain events relating to its business. There can be no assurance that MetLife will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligation to us or that such indemnification will be sufficient to us in the event of a dispute or nonperformance by MetLife.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe price of our securities, including our common stock, may fluctuate significantly\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our securities, including our common stock, may trade. The market price of our securities, including our common stock, may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including factors which are described elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could also adversely affect the trading price of our securities, including our common stock.\nWe currently have no plans to declare and pay dividends on our common stock, and legal restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock and our ability to repurchase our common stock at the level we wish\nWe currently have no plans to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use our future distributable earnings, if any, to pay debt obligations, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs, to carry out any share or debt repurchases that we may undertake, as well as for general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock in the near-term, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our\ncommon stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which the shares currently trade. Any future declaration and payment of dividends or other distributions or returns of capital will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including capital requirements of our insurance subsidiaries), and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends or make other distributions or returns on our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends, distributions or returns of capital.\nIn addition, the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock, as well as debt and other financial instruments that we may issue in the future, may limit or prohibit the payment of dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, or the payment of interest on our junior subordinated debentures. For example, terms applicable to our junior subordinated debentures may restrict our ability to pay interest on those debentures in certain circumstances. Suspension of payments of interest on our junior subordinated debentures, whether required under the relevant indenture or optional, could cause \u201cdividend stopper\u201d provisions applicable under those and other instruments to restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in various situations, including situations where we may be experiencing financial stress, and may restrict our ability to pay dividends or interest on our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures as well. Similarly, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock and any preferred securities we may issue in the future may contain restrictions on our ability to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends thereon if we have not fulfilled our dividend obligations under such preferred stock or other preferred securities.\nState insurance laws and Delaware corporate law, as well as certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock\nState laws may delay, deter, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For example, such laws may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons who, together with affiliates, own, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation.\nThe insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which our insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a business combination involving the Company. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states\u2019 statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Holding Company Regulation.\u201d These regulatory restrictions may delay, deter or prevent a potential merger or sale of our company, even if our Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of stockholders for us to merge or be sold. These restrictions also may delay sales by us or acquisitions by third parties of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Investment Company Act may require approval by the contract owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any affiliated investment advisor to a mutual fund underlying our variable contracts, including Brighthouse Advisers. Further, FINRA approval would be necessary for a change of control of any broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of BHF.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and may encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than attempt a hostile takeover, including provisions relating to: (i) the nomination, election and removal of directors (including, for example, the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on our Board of Directors); (ii) the super-majority vote of at least two-thirds in voting power of the issued and outstanding voting stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and (iii) the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions are not intended to prevent us from being acquired under hostile or other circumstances. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Brighthouse and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.", "PERMNO": 16816, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "BHF"}
