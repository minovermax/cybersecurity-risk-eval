Risk Factors\nOur consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Form 10-K. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which is frequently difficult, expensive, and time-consuming with which to comply; noncompliance could adversely affect our operations and efforts to grow our business results.\nThe regulated waste management and secure information destruction industries are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the collection, transportation, packaging, labeling, handling, documentation, reporting, treatment and disposal of regulated waste and the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information. Our business requires us to obtain many permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates, and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Federal, state and local regulations change often, and new regulations are frequently adopted. Changes in the regulations could require us to obtain new permits or to change the way in which we operate our business. We might be unable to obtain the new permits that we require, and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant.\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 20\nPART II\nMany of the permits that we require, especially those to build and operate processing plants and transfer facilities, are difficult and time-consuming to obtain. They may also contain conditions or restrictions that limit our ability to operate efficiently, and they may not be issued as quickly as we need them (or at all). If we cannot obtain the permits, or if they contain unfavorable conditions, it could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues and/or profitability.\nIf we encounter regulatory compliance issues in the course of operating our businesses, we may experience adverse publicity, which may intensify if such non-compliance results in civil or criminal liability. This adverse publicity may harm our reputation, and result in difficulties in attracting new customers, or retaining existing customers.\nThe level of governmental enforcement of environmental and other regulations has an uncertain effect on our business and could reduce the demand for our services.\nWe believe that strict enforcement of laws and regulations relating to regulated waste collection and treatment, the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, and recalls and retrieval of products by governmental authorities can have a positive effect on our business, as these laws and regulations may increase the demand for our services. Relaxation of enforcement, government shutdowns, or other changes in governmental regulation of regulated waste, personal and confidential information or products to be recalled or retrieved could increase the number of competitors we face or reduce or delay the need for our services.\nComplications with the implementation of our ERP system could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in the process of an implementation of an ERP system, which will replace most of our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company\u2019s management team related to the operation of our business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully implement our ERP system as planned, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed.\nFluctuations in the commodity market related to the demand and price for recycled paper may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell nearly all of the shredded paper from our secure information destruction business to paper companies and recycled paper brokers. Sorted office paper is marketed as a commodity and is subject to significant demand and price fluctuations beyond our control. Historically, economic and market shifts, fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices, sales volume, and margins for pulp and paper products. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. The overall levels of demand for the pulp and paper products, and consequently their sales and profitability, reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and worldwide. As a result, the market\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 21\nPART II\ndemand for recycled paper can be volatile due to factors beyond our control. Lack of demand for our shredded paper material could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant charges as a result of portfolio optimization; portfolio optimization may not achieve the desired results.\nWe continue to evaluate the performance of our portfolio of assets and businesses. Based on this evaluation, we may sell certain assets or businesses or exit particular markets. Any impairments and losses on divestiture resulting from this process may cause us to record significant charges, including those related to goodwill, other intangible assets, and accumulated currency translation adjustment losses. In addition, divestitures may not yield the targeted improvements in our business. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. Any charges that we are required to record or the failure to achieve the intended financial results associated with divestitures of businesses or assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRestrictions in our Credit Agreement and our Senior Notes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions and the value of our securities.\nOur Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements; certain financial covenants; notices of default and certain other material events; payment of obligations; preservation of corporate existence, rights, privileges, permits, licenses, franchises and intellectual property; maintenance of property and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of liens, investments and indebtedness; mergers and certain other fundamental changes; dispositions of assets; restricted payments; changes in our line of business; transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business, increase the amount of interest expense we ultimately pay pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Our Senior Notes also contain certain covenants that could have a similar effect on our ability to operate our business (see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 9 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement, along with certain of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Senior Notes, may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with these provisions could result in a default or an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause their loans to become due and payable in full, foreclose against any assets securing the debt under our Credit Agreement and force us and our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our stock could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 22\nPART II\nServicing debt and funding other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. Our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, on future operating performance, general economic conditions, competition, and litigation, legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and business.\nSome of these factors are beyond our control. There is no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe amount of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $2.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including long-term debt and short-term debt and excluding unamortized debt issuance costs. We also have the ability to incur additional indebtedness subject to our financial covenants.\nOur leverage could have adverse consequences on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our available cash to payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour ability to access credit markets on terms we deem acceptable may be impaired; and\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.\nRisks from our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have established operations in the U.S. and 18 other countries. Foreign operations carry special risks including:\n\u2022\nexchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nsubstantial inflation in certain markets;\n\u2022\ndependence in certain markets on government entities as customers;\n\u2022\ndelays in the collection of accounts receivable related to certain government funding practices;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in or compliance with U.S., local or other applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations concerning anti-corruption, anti-bribery (i.e. FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws), global trade, trade sanctions, competition, privacy and data protection;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022\nindustry or macro-economic trends;\n\u2022\npermitting and regulatory standards;\n\u2022\ndifferences in local laws, regulations, practices, and business customs;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the U.S. or movement of funds to other countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nincreases and volatility in labor costs; and\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 23\nPART II\n\u2022\nproperty ownership restrictions in certain countries.\nAny of the foregoing or other factors associated with doing business abroad could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have operations in Latin America, and changes in the business, regulatory, political or social climate could adversely affect our operations there, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth plans.\nWe have business operations in Argentina and Brazil. Doing business in those countries exposes us to risks related to political instability, corruption, economic volatility, social unrest, tax and foreign investment policies, public safety and security, and uncertain application of laws and regulations. Consequently, actions or events in any of those countries that are beyond our control could restrict our ability to operate there or otherwise adversely affect the financial results of those operations. Furthermore, changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in any of those countries, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could affect our ability to continue our operations there, which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face continuing risks relating to compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nOn June 12, 2017, the SEC issued a subpoena to us, requesting documents and information relating to our compliance with the FCPA or other foreign or domestic anti-corruption laws with respect to certain of the our operations in Latin America. In addition, the DOJ has notified us that it is investigating this matter in parallel with the SEC. We are cooperating with these agencies and are also conducting an internal investigation of these and other matters, including outside of Latin America, under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the assistance of outside counsel, and this investigation has found evidence of improper conduct. These matters (and other matters which may arise or of which we become aware in the future) may be deemed to violate the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Such determinations could subject us to, among other things, enforcement actions by the SEC or the DOJ or other regulatory bodies, fines, penalties, or litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 20 - Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.\nWe are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits and may be named as a defendant in future lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention, and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and, to the extent available, liability insurance. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any significant judgment or settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 20 - Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 24\nPART II\nChanging market conditions in the healthcare industry, healthcare consolidation and healthcare reform, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWithin the U.S., the healthcare industry is evolving to meet competing demands for increased healthcare coverage of a growing and aging population and economic pressures to reduce healthcare costs. As a result of these dynamics, hospital networks are consolidating physician practices into their networks, independent practices are consolidating together, and healthcare providers are focused on cutting costs within their businesses. These changes exert downward pricing pressure, including the impact of GPO rebates and administrative fees, on services that we provide to healthcare customers which could adversely affect our results of operations. Commitments made in connection with the SQ Settlement may affect our ability to increase prices in the future and a deterioration in our customer relationships as a result of the MDL Action may affect our ability to sell additional services to our customers, both of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe industries in which we participate are highly competitive. This competition has required us in the past to reduce our prices to our customers, may require us to reduce our prices in the future or may affect our ability to increase prices in the future. Price reductions or our inability to increase prices could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face direct competition from a large number of small, local competitors. Because it requires very little financial investment to compete in the collection and transportation of regulated wastes or the secure destruction of personal and confidential information, there are many regional and local companies in these industries. We face competition from these businesses, and competition from them is likely to exist in new locations to which we may expand in the future. In addition, large national companies with substantial resources operate in the markets we serve. For example, in the U.S., Waste Management, Inc., Clean Harbors, Inc., and Iron Mountain Incorporated all offer competing services.\nUnfavorable market conditions, including those driven by economic or social trends, may impact the volume of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information we collect from customers.\nThe compliance-based services we provide rely on the generation of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information by our customers. The amount of material generated by our customers may be impacted by macro-economic trends associated with manufacturing and industrial markets, healthcare market dynamics, and trends associated with electronic and digital record keeping. Many of our services are provided on a subscription basis with a monthly fee to minimize short-term or cyclical variability associated with these factors. However, some of our services are provided on a transactional basis, and long-term trends resulting from these factors could reduce the demand for our services, whether we provide them on a subscription or transactional basis.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, including remediating known material weaknesses in our internal controls as of December 31, 2019, we may not be able to report our financial results timely and accurately or prevent fraud, which could adversely affect investor confidence in our company, our results of operations and our stock price.\nAs disclosed in more detail in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Report, we have identified material weaknesses, including a material weakness related to ineffective general information technology controls, as of December 31, 2019, in our internal controls over financial reporting. Due to these material\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 25\nPART II\nweaknesses, we have also concluded our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2019.\nInternal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We are implementing remedial measures and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. These measures will result in additional technology and other expenses. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of December 31, 2019, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nAttacks on our information technology systems could damage our reputation, negatively impact our businesses and expose us to litigation risk.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. We rely heavily on various proprietary and third-party information systems. Our reputation for the secure handling of customer and other sensitive information is critical to the success of our business. Like other large multi-national corporations, we are potentially subject to cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, wire fraud and other cyber incidents. Our incident response efforts, business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be entirely effective as our information technology and network infrastructure may still be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance, computer viruses, power outages, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, breaches with respect to third-party systems or other disruptions. A cybersecurity incident and breach of our information systems could lead to theft, destruction, misappropriation or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, which could result in business disruption, negative publicity, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, brand damage, adverse financial and operational results, and potential litigation.\nOur management depends on relevant and reliable information for decision-making purposes, including key performance indicators and financial reporting. Any significant loss of data, failure to maintain reliable data, disruptions affecting our information systems, or delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our businesses without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends in part on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. If our information systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brands and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 26\nPART II\nA change or deterioration in our relations with our employees or an increase in labor and employment costs could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor and employment is one of our highest costs and increases in employment costs could materially affect our cost structure and our profitability. We compete with other businesses in our markets for qualified employees and the labor supply is sometimes tight in our markets. A shortage of qualified employees or further unionization would require us to incur additional costs related to wages and benefits; inefficiencies in operations; unanticipated costs in sourcing temporary or third party labor; legal fees and interference with customer relationships.\nWe are a party to 13 collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and Canada, covering approximately 650 employees, or approximately 4.4%, of our total U.S. and Canadian workforce and further agreements and works councils covering approximately 1,000 employees in our other international locations. These agreements expire on a scheduled basis depending upon the negotiated length of the contract\u2019s term. Collective bargaining agreement negotiations occur every year depending upon which agreements expire and whether one or both parties seek the modification of terms.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of future agreements with unions in a manner acceptable to us. There is also no guarantee that current non-union employees will not seek union representation resulting in additional collective bargaining agreements with associated increased costs to us. Potential work disruptions from labor disputes may disrupt our businesses and adversely affect our brand, customer relations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMarket conditions could adversely change and our earnings could decline resulting in charges to impair intangible assets, such as goodwill.\nAs a result of our various acquisitions, the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 contains goodwill of $3.0 billion and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $1.4 billion. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we evaluate on an ongoing basis whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment to the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets such as goodwill. As circumstances after an acquisition can change, we may not realize the value of these intangible assets. During 2019 and 2018, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $17.7 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of operating permits, tradenames, and customer relationships. Additionally in 2019 we recognized $228.3 million in non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to our Canada, Domestic Environmental Solutions, and Latin America reporting units and in 2018, we recognized $358.7 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to our Domestic CRS and Latin America reporting units. We recognized these impairments due to a reduction of forecasted future cash flows in each reporting unit, as discussed in the Impairment section of Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 7 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The recognition of any potential future impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe handling of regulated waste exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nAs a company engaged in regulated waste management, we face risks of liability for environmental contamination. CERCLA and similar state laws impose strict liability on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment as well as on the businesses that generate those substances and the businesses that transport them to our facilities. Responsible parties may be liable for substantial investigation and clean-up costs even if they operated their\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 27\nPART II\nbusinesses properly and complied with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several, which means that if we were found to be a business with responsibility for a particular CERCLA site, we could be required to pay the entire cost of the investigation and clean-up even if we were not the party responsible for the release of the hazardous substance and other companies might also be liable.\nOur pollution liability insurance excludes liabilities under CERCLA. Thus, if we were to incur liability under CERCLA and if we could not identify other parties responsible under the law whom we are able to compel to contribute to our expenses, the cost to us could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity. Our customer service agreements make clear that the customer is responsible for making sure that only appropriate materials are disposed of. If there were a claim against us that a customer might be legally liable for, we might not be successful in recovering our damages from the customer, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 20 - Legal Proceedings.\nTax interpretations and changes in tax regulations and legislation could adversely affect us.\nTax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net income, income tax expense or recovery, and deferred income tax assets or liabilities. Tax rules and regulations, including those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us that may be challenged by the applicable taxation authorities upon audit. Although we believe our assumptions, judgements and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, broadened the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions, and credits, limited the ability of U.S. corporations to deduct interest expense, and transitioned to a territorial tax system which allows for the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. with a 100% federal dividends received deduction prospectively. In addition, the Tax Act required a one-time transitional tax on foreign cash equivalents and previously unremitted earnings. Several of the new provisions enacted as part of the Tax Act require clarification and guidance from the IRS and Treasury Department. These or other changes in U.S. tax laws could impact our profits, effective tax rate, and cash flows.\nWe have accumulated NOLs arising from our operations and foreign and domestic acquisitions of approximately $379.4 million as of December 31, 2019. We have recognized valuation allowances to reduce these amounts to our current estimate for NOLs that will be recoverable against future taxable income prior to their expiration in accordance with the appropriate tax regulations. If our estimates change or we do not generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these NOLs we may have to record additional valuation allowances resulting in higher income tax expense, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 10 - Income Taxes.\nIn addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entities and if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. In connection with such restructurings we could also incur additional charges associated with consulting fees and other charges.\nWe face risks associated with project work and services that are provided on a non-recurring basis.\nWhile the majority of our business is based on long-term contracts for regularly scheduled service, we do have a portion of revenue which is derived from short-term projects or services that we provide on a non-\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 28\nPART II\nrecurring basis. Product recall and retrieval events, one-time purge events for secure information destruction, and certain hazardous waste services that we provide on a project or non-recurring basis are not predictable in terms of frequency, size or duration. Our customers\u2019 need for these services could be influenced by regulatory changes, fluctuations in commodity market performance, natural disasters and acts of God, or other factors beyond our control. Variability in the demand for these services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe handling, transportation, and treatment of regulated waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to employees and others.\nOur business requires our employees to handle materials that may be infectious or hazardous to life and property in other ways. While we try to handle such materials with care and in accordance with accepted and safe methods, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills, and natural disasters always exists.\nExamples of incidents that may present possible exposure to hazardous materials include:\n\u2022\ntruck accidents;\n\u2022\ndamaged or leaking containers;\n\u2022\nimproper storage of regulated waste by customers;\n\u2022\nimproper placement by customers of materials into the waste stream that we are not authorized or able to process, such as certain body parts and tissues; or\n\u2022\nmalfunctioning treatment plant equipment, such as power outages, or ineffective backup systems.\nHuman beings, or animals could be injured or sickened or property could be damaged by exposure to regulated waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us.\nWhile we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity.\nThe handling of secure information for destruction exposes us to potential data security risks that could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment in the U.S. and Canada surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Certain legislation, including the FACTA, the HIPAA, the Economic Espionage Act in the U.S., the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada and the GDPR in the EU, require documents to be securely destroyed to avoid identity theft and inadvertent disclosure of confidential and sensitive information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. In addition, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws or are expected to do so. The continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request us to take additional measures to enhance security and/or assume higher liability under our contracts. As a result of legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations to further improve data security. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operational complexity, and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 29\nPART II\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe participate in multi-employer pension plans administered by employer and union trustees. To the extent that those plans are underfunded, ERISA may subject us to substantial liabilities in the event we, whether partially or totally, cease to have obligations to contribute to the plans. Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit plans, circumstances such as a plan's termination, an employer's partial or complete withdrawal from, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from, an underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan can trigger our obligation to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi-employer plan's unfunded vested liabilities. Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as \"endangered,\" \"seriously endangered,\" or \"critical\" status. If plans in which we participate are in critical status or underfunded, we could be required to make additional contributions.\nBased upon the information available to us from plan administrators as of March 29, 2019, one of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate is underfunded. The Pension Protection Act requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We have been notified that one plan is in \"critical\" status and this plan may require additional contributions. The amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will be based on future levels of employee work that require the specific use of the union employees covered by these plans, investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans. Additional funding could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows, and results of operations. For more information, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 13 - Retirement and Other Employee Benefit Programs in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncreases in transportation costs may adversely affect our business and reduce our earnings.\nWe maintain an extensive transportation network and fleet of vehicles. A significant increase in market prices for trucks or fuel could adversely affect our business through higher transportation costs and reduce our operating margins and reported earnings.\nSome of our customers have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe provide service to a number of customers, including governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased prices, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results.\nAn inability to retain key personnel or difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel may adversely affect our business\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets. The labor market in the United States is very competitive and the unemployment rate is at historic lows. We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experience management team. We must hire, train and develop effective employees. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. In addition, employee turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our business. Difficulty in replacing or adding personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n2019 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 30\nPART II\nOur success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and key personnel. We have experienced unplanned turnover in our executive team in recent periods. The unexpected loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention, or hiring efforts will be successful. Competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our facilities or equipment, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, and the temporary disruption in transportation services which we rely on to deliver waste to our facilities. These events could prevent or delay shipments and reduce both volumes and revenue. Weather conditions and other event driven special projects may also cause variations in our results. We may be required to suspend operations in some of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83906, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "SRCL"}
