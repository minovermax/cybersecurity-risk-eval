{"cik": "1520566", "company": "Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report, including the financial statements and related notes, when deciding to invest in us. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods and are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nFinancial Reporting, Credit and Liquidity Risks\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient capital to operate our business.\nOur financing strategy includes the use of significant leverage because in order to make servicing advances and fund originations, we require liquidity in excess of that generated by our operations. Accordingly, our ability to finance our operations depends on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms and to renew or replace existing financings as they expire. Such financings may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain such financings, we may need to raise the funds we require in the capital markets or through other means, any of which may increase our cost of funds.\nWe are generally required to renew our financing arrangements each year, which exposes us to refinancing and interest rate risks. Our ability to refinance existing debt and borrow additional funds is affected by a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nthe available liquidity in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nan event of default, a negative ratings action by a rating agency and limitations imposed on us under the indentures governing our current debt that contain restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions that may limit our ability to raise additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the lenders from which we borrow; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on borrowings on advance facilities imposed by the amount of eligible collateral pledged, which may be less than the borrowing capacity of the advance facility.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms for any of the foregoing reasons, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nAlthough we and our subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness, we believe we have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. These agreements generally restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, however, these restrictions are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we incur additional debt, the related risks could be magnified and could limit our financial and operating activities.\nOur current and any future indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy and comply with our obligations with respect to the unsecured senior notes;\n\u2022\nsubject us to increased sensitivity to increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with relatively less debt in economic downturns, adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events; or\n\u2022\nreduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business, industry and economic conditions.\nNationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 11\nIn addition, our substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund future acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, general corporate and other purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors outside of our control. Our substantial obligations could have other important consequences. For example, our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which limit our ability to incur liens, to incur debt and to sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could harm our business or prospects and could result in our bankruptcy.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of previous or potential future acquisitions.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of previous or potential future acquisitions, including the acquisition of assets, will depend, in part, on our ability to scale-up to appropriately service any such assets, and integrate the businesses of such acquired companies with our business. The process of acquiring assets or companies may disrupt our business including diverting management's attention from ongoing business concerns, and may not result in the full benefits expected. The risks associated with acquisitions include, among others:\n\u2022\nunknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information, management style, servicing practices, communications and other systems including information technology systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods; and\n\u2022\nnot retaining key employees.\nIn the event that we acquire a platform, we may elect to operate this platform in addition to our current platform for a period of time or indefinitely. Individually or collectively, these transactions could substantially increase the UPB, or alter the composition of our portfolio, of mortgage loans that we service or have an otherwise significant impact on our business. We can provide no assurances that we will enter into any such agreements or as to the timing of any potential acquisitions. Additionally, we may make potentially significant acquisitions which could expose us to greater risks than we currently experience in servicing our current portfolio and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of potential future acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur earnings may decrease because of changes in prevailing interest rates.\nOur profitability is directly affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. The following are certain material risks we face related to changes in interest rates:\nServicing:\n\u2022\na decrease in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds which may lead to (i) increased amortization expense; (ii) decrease in servicing fees; and (iii) decrease in the value of our MSRs;\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates, together with an increase in monthly payments when an adjustable mortgage loan\u2019s interest rate adjusts upward from an initial fixed rate or a low introductory rate, may cause increased delinquency, default and foreclosure. Increased mortgage defaults and foreclosures may adversely affect our business as they increase our expenses and reduce the number of mortgages we service;\nOriginations:\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates could adversely affect our loan originations volume because refinancing an existing loan would be less attractive for homeowners and qualifying for a purchase money loan may be more difficult for consumers;\nOther:\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our outstanding debt, including our ability to finance servicing advances and loan originations and for borrowing for acquisitions; and\n\u2022\na decrease in interest rates could reduce our earnings from our custodial deposit accounts.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\n12 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe use financial models that heavily rely on estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, such as MSRs and excess spread, and if our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, it may affect our earnings.\nWe use internal financial models that utilize, wherever possible, market participant data to value certain of our assets, including our MSRs, newly originated loans held for sale and MSR financing liabilities for purposes of financial reporting. These models are complex and use asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest and discount rates. In addition, the modeling requirements of MSRs are complex because of the high number of variables that drive cash flows associated with MSRs. Even if the general accuracy of our valuation models is validated, valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the models. In determining value for MSRs we make certain assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe rates of prepayment and repayment within the underlying pools of mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nprojected rates of delinquencies, defaults and liquidations;\n\u2022\nfuture interest rates;\n\u2022\nour cost to service the loans;\n\u2022\nancillary revenues; and\n\u2022\namounts of future servicing advances.\nIf these assumptions or relationships prove to be inaccurate, if market conditions change or if errors are found in our models, the value of certain assets may decrease or the value of certain liabilities could increase, which could impact our ability to satisfy minimum net worth covenants and borrowing conditions in our debt agreements and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates.\nIn our Originations segment, we use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. The nature and timing of hedging transactions influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility, and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have third-party credit and servicer risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operation.\nConsumer Credit Risk: We provide representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of the loans that we sell that typically are in place for the life of the loan. In the event of a breach of these representations and warranties, we may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser, and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by us. Our loss estimates are affected by factors both internal and external in nature, including, level of loan sales, as well as to whom the loans are sold, the expectation of credit loss on repurchases and indemnifications, our success rate at appealing repurchase demands, our ability to recover any losses from third parties, the overall economic condition in the housing market, the economic condition of borrowers, the political environment at investor agencies and the overall U.S. and world economy. Many of the factors are beyond our control and may lead to judgments that are susceptible to change. In adverse market conditions, loans may decrease in value due to an increase in delinquencies, borrower defaults and non-payments. In addition, property values may experience losses at liquidation due to extensions in foreclosure and REO sales timelines as well as home price depreciation.\nCounterparty Credit Risk: We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to various agreements. Although certain credit facilities and warehouse lines are committed, we may experience a disruption in operations due to a lender withholding a funding of a borrowing requested on the respective credit facility.\nNationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 13\nPrior Servicer Risk: We service mortgage loans under guidelines set forth by regulatory agencies and GSEs. Failure to meet stipulations of the servicing guidelines can result in the assessment of fines and loss of reimbursement of loan related advances, expenses, interest and servicing fees. When the servicing of a portfolio is assumed either through purchase of servicing rights or through a subservicing arrangement, various loans in the acquired portfolio may have been previously serviced in a manner that will contribute towards our not meeting certain servicing guidelines. If not recovered from a prior servicer, such events frequently lead to the eventual realization of a loss to us. The recovery process against a prior servicer can be prolonged based upon time required by us to meet minimum loss deductibles under the indemnification provisions in our agreements with the prior servicer and for the time requirements by the prior servicer to review underlying loss events and our request for indemnification. The amounts ultimately recovered from prior servicers may differ from our estimated recoveries recorded based on the prior servicer's interpretation of responsibility for loss, which could lead to our realization of additional losses.\nAny of the above could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nServicing\nA significant increase in delinquencies for the loans we own and service could have a material impact on our revenues, expenses and liquidity and on the valuation of our MSRs.\n\u2022\nRevenue. An increase in delinquencies will result in lower revenue for loans we service for GSEs and Ginnie Mae because we only collect servicing fees from GSEs and Ginnie Mae for performing loans. Additionally, while increased delinquencies generate higher ancillary revenues, including late fees, these fees are not likely to be recoverable in the event that the related loan is liquidated. In addition, an increase in delinquencies lowers the interest income we receive on cash held in collection and other accounts.\n\u2022\nExpenses. An increase in delinquencies will result in a higher cost to service due to the increased time and effort required to collect payments from delinquent borrowers and an increase in interest expense as a result of an increase in our advancing obligations.\n\u2022\nLiquidity. An increase in delinquencies could also negatively impact our liquidity because of an increase in borrowings under advance facilities.\n\u2022\nValuation of MSRs. We base the price we pay for MSRs on, among other things, our projections of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans. Our expectation of delinquencies is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections. If delinquencies were significantly greater than expected, the estimated fair value of our MSRs could be diminished. If the estimated fair value of MSRs is reduced, we may not be able to satisfy minimum net worth covenants and borrowing conditions in our debt agreements and we could suffer a loss, which has a negative impact on our financial results.\nAn increase in delinquency rates could therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adjust to operational changes in a timely manner to sustain profitability.\nWe may enter into arrangements with investors or other counterparties to subservice loans or provide services in areas that are new to us. We perform due diligence procedures to evaluate the feasibility of such ventures or transactions prior to their execution. The achievement of expected returns is often dependent on attainment of certain operating assumptions, such as lower operating costs or attainment of key performance metrics. To the extent we are unfamiliar with investor and/or risks assumed, or to the extent we have not demonstrated past proven performance on the operating metrics, we may not be able to adjust costs or achieve the desired operating metrics in a timely manner that will allow the return on investment as planned, which could expose to us to significant financial loss.\n14 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may not be able to maintain or grow our business if we do not acquire MSRs or enter into additional subservicing agreements on favorable terms.\nOur servicing portfolio is subject to \u201crun off,\u201d meaning that mortgage loans serviced by us may be prepaid prior to maturity or repaid through standard amortization of principal. As a result, our ability to maintain the size of our servicing portfolio depends on our ability to acquire the right to service additional pools of residential mortgages, enter into additional subservicing agreements or to originate additional mortgages. We have also shifted the mix of our servicing portfolio to a greater mix of subserviced loans. While we expect this strategy to have longer-term benefits, in the short-term this shift in our servicing portfolio to subservicing could reduce our revenue and earnings as measured by basis points. In addition, there can be no assurance that our pipeline of subservicing opportunities will ultimately be consummated or will remain the same size.\nIn addition, the FHFA\u2019s Office of Inspector General recommended enhanced GSE oversight of transfers of MSRs to non-bank servicers such as us. While we currently meet FHFA requirements, the FHFA could enact more stringent requirements on the GSEs, or other federal or state agencies may enact additional requirements that are more stringent. Additionally, if we do not comply with our seller/servicer obligations, the GSEs may not consent to approve future transfers of MSRs.\nIf we do not acquire MSRs or enter into additional subservicing agreements on terms favorable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of the loans we service are higher risk loans, which are more expensive to service than conventional mortgage loans.\nSome of the mortgage loans we service are higher risk loans, meaning that the loans are to less credit worthy borrowers or for properties the value of which has decreased. These loans are more expensive to service because they require more frequent interaction with customers and greater monitoring and oversight. Additionally, in connection with the ongoing mortgage market reform and regulatory developments, servicers of higher risk loans are subject to increased scrutiny by state and federal regulators and will experience higher compliance costs, which could result in a further increase in servicing costs. We may not be able to pass along any of the additional expenses we incur in servicing higher risk loans to our servicing clients. The greater cost of servicing higher risk loans, which may be further increased through regulatory reform, consent decrees or enforcement, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to make servicing advances that can be subject to delays in recovery or may not be recoverable in certain circumstances.\nMSRs - Fair Value: During any period in which a borrower is not making payments, we are required under most of our servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors, pay property taxes and insurance premiums, legal expenses and other protective advances. We also advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors. As home values change, we may have to reconsider certain of the assumptions underlying our decisions to make advances, and in certain situations our contractual obligations may require us to make certain advances for which we may not be reimbursed. In addition when a mortgage loan serviced by us defaults or becomes delinquent, the repayment to us of the advance may be delayed until the mortgage loan is repaid or refinanced or liquidation occurs.\nWe have sold to a joint venture capitalized by New Residential and certain third-party investors the rights to mortgage servicing rights and servicer advances related to certain loan pools. In connection with these transactions, New Residential purchased the equity of wholly-owned special purpose subsidiaries of Nationstar that issued limited recourse funding to finance the advances. We continue to service these loans. In the event that New Residential receives requests for advances in excess of amounts that they or their co-investors are willing or able to fund, we are obligated to fund these advance requests. Since we have transferred the related advance facilities to New Residential, we may have to obtain other sources of financing which may not be available.\nOur inability to fund these advances could result in a termination event under the applicable servicing agreement, an event of default under the advance facilities and a breach of our purchase agreement with New Residential. Our inability to fund these advance requests could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReverse Mortgages: As a reverse mortgage servicer, we are also responsible for funding draws due to borrowers in a timely manner, remitting to investors interest accrued and paying for interest shortfalls. Advances on reverse mortgages are typically greater than advances on forward residential mortgages. They are typically recovered upon weekly or monthly reimbursement or from sales in the market. In the event we receive requests for advances in excess of amounts we are able to fund, we may not be able to fund these advance requests, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations. A delay in our ability to collect an advance may adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for an advance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 15\nOur counterparties may terminate our servicing rights and subservicing contracts.\nThe owners of the loans we service and the primary servicers of the loans we subservice, may, under certain circumstances, terminate our MSRs or subservicing contracts, respectively.\nAgency Servicing: We are party to seller/servicer agreements and/or subject to guidelines and regulations (collectively, seller/servicer obligations) with one or more of the GSEs, FHA and Ginnie Mae. As is standard in the industry, under the terms of these seller/servicer agreements, the agencies have the right to terminate us as servicer of the loans we service on their behalf at any time and also have the right to cause us to sell the MSRs to a third party. These seller/servicer obligations include financial covenants that include capital requirements related to tangible net worth. To the extent that these capital requirements are not met, the applicable agency may suspend or terminate these agreements, which would prohibit us from further servicing these specific types of mortgage loans or being an approved servicer. If we are unable to meet these capital requirements, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSubservicing: Under our subservicing contracts, the primary servicers for which we conduct subservicing activities have the right to terminate our subservicing contracts with or without cause, with limited notice and negligible compensation. Acquiring additional subservicing contracts may exacerbate these risks.\nIf our servicing rights or subservicing contracts terminated on a material portion of our servicing portfolio, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe service reverse mortgages, which subjects us to additional risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe reverse mortgage business is subject to substantial risks, including market, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational and legal risks. Although foreclosures involving reverse mortgages generally occur less frequently than forward mortgages, loan defaults on reverse mortgages leading to foreclosures may occur if borrowers fail to maintain their property or fail to pay taxes or home insurance premiums. A general increase in foreclosure rates may adversely impact how reverse mortgages are perceived by potential customers and thus reduce demand for reverse mortgages. Additionally, we could become subject to negative headline risk in the event that loan defaults on reverse mortgages lead to foreclosures or evictions of elderly homeowners.\nWe could have a downgrade in our servicer ratings.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and Fitch rate us as a residential loan servicer. Favorable ratings from these agencies are important to the conduct of our loan servicing business. Downgrades in servicer ratings could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance servicing advances and maintain our status as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;\n\u2022\nlead to the early termination of existing advance facilities and affect the terms and availability of advance facilities that we may seek in the future;\n\u2022\ncause our termination as servicer in our servicing agreements that require that we maintain specified servicer ratings; and\n\u2022\nfurther impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions.\nAny of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOriginations\nWe may not be able to maintain the volumes in our loan originations business, which would adversely affect our ability to replenish our servicing business.\nThe volume of loans funded within our loan originations business is subject to multiple factors, including changes in interest rates and availability of government programs. Volume in our originations business is based in large part on the refinancing of existing mortgage loans that we service, which is highly dependent on interest rates and government mortgage modification programs. Our volume may decline if interest rates increase or if government programs terminate and are not replaced with similar programs or if we cannot replace this volume with our own modification solutions. If we are unable to maintain our loan originations volume then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n16 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may be required to indemnify or repurchase loans we sold, or will sell, if these loans fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances.\nThe indentures governing our securitized pools of loans and our contracts with purchasers of our whole loans contain provisions that require us to indemnify or repurchase the related loans under certain circumstances. While our contracts vary, they contain provisions that require us to repurchase loans if:\n\u2022\nour representations and warranties concerning loan quality and loan circumstances are inaccurate, including representations concerning the licensing of a mortgage broker;\n\u2022\nwe fail to secure adequate mortgage insurance within a certain period after closing;\n\u2022\na mortgage insurance provider denies coverage;\n\u2022\nwe fail to comply, at the individual loan level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in the current dynamic regulatory environment; or\n\u2022\nthe borrower fails to make certain initial loan payments due to the purchaser. We are subject to repurchase claims and may continue to receive claims in the future. If we are required to indemnify or repurchase loans that we originate or have previously originated and sell or securitize that result in losses that exceed our reserve, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTermination of government mortgage modification programs could adversely affect future revenues.\nUnder the government mortgage modification programs a participating servicer may be entitled to receive financial incentives and success fees in connection with a mortgage refinancing or modification plan it enters into with eligible borrowers. Programs such as Home Affordable Modification Program (\"HAMP\") and Home Affordable Refinance Program (\"HARP\") have been significant drivers of our originations and servicing revenues. Changes in legislation or regulation regarding loan modification programs and changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans may impact the extent to which we participate in and receive financial benefits from such programs, or may increase the expense of our participation in such programs. We expect refinancing and modification volumes, revenues and margins to decline in 2017 as we believe peak HARP and HAMP refinancings and modifications have already occurred. HAMP expired on December 31, 2016, and HARP is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017. If HARP is not extended, planned replacement programs are not implemented or our financial benefits from such programs decrease, our revenues could decrease, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and by Ginnie Mae to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors.\nThere are various proposals which deal with GSE reform, including winding down the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as proposals to implement reforms relating to borrowers, lenders and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of loans that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, improving underwriting standards and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. Thus, the long-term future of the GSEs is still in doubt.\nOur ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends to a significant degree on programs administered by the GSEs, Ginnie Mae, and others that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") in the secondary market. These entities play a critical role in the residential mortgage industry and we have significant business relationships with many of them. Almost all of the conforming loans we originate qualify under existing standards for inclusion in guaranteed mortgage securities backed by one of these entities. We also derive other material financial benefits from these relationships, including the assumption of credit risk on loans included in such mortgage securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees and the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures. If it is not possible for us to complete the sale or securitization of certain of our mortgage loans due to changes in GSE and Ginnie Mae programs, we may lack liquidity under our mortgage financing facilities to continue to fund mortgage loans and our revenues and margins on new loan originations would be materially and negatively impacted.\nAny discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these GSEs and Ginnie Mae or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of these GSEs or Ginnie Mae could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nNationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 17\nXome\nXome participates in highly competitive markets and pressure from existing and new companies could adversely affect Xome\u2019s businesses.\nThe markets for Xome\u2019s services are very competitive and Xome\u2019s success depends on its ability to continue to attract additional customers, consumers and real estate professionals to its mobile applications and websites. Xome\u2019s existing and potential competitors include companies that operate, or could develop, national and local real estate mobile applications and websites. These companies could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available and leverage their existing user bases and proprietary technologies to provide products and services that end-users might view as superior to our offerings. Any of Xome\u2019s future or existing competitors may introduce different products that provide solutions similar to our own but with either better user interfaces, branding and marketing resources, or at a lower price. In addition, the time and expense associated with switching from Xome\u2019s competitors\u2019 services and technologies to ours may limit Xome\u2019s growth. If we are unable to continue to innovate and grow the number of end-users of Xome\u2019s mobile applications and websites, we may not remain competitive or may face downward pricing pressures, and our business and financial performance could suffer.\nXome is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels and any failure to comply with existing new regulations may adversely impact us, our clients and our results of operations.\nXome is subject to licensing and regulation as a real estate broker, auctioneer, appraisal management company, title agent and/or insurance agent in a number of states and may be subject to new licensing and regulation as it expands service offerings. Xome is subject to audits and examinations that are conducted by federal and state regulatory authorities and, as a vendor, is also subject to similar audit requirements imposed on its clients, including us. Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by various state licensing authorities for the particular type of service provided and to participate in regular background checks, fingerprinting requirements and continuing education programs. We may incur significant ongoing costs to comply with governmental regulations and new laws and regulations may be adopted that prohibit us from engaging Xome as a vendor, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nXome\u2019s revenue from clients in the mortgage and real estate industries is affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions.\nReal estate markets are subject to fluctuations, due to factors such as the relative relationship of supply to demand, the availability of alternative investment products, the unemployment rate, real wage increases, inflation and the general economic environment. An economic slowdown or recession, in addition to other non-economic factors such as an excess supply in properties, a change in consumer preferences towards rental properties or declining consumer confidence in the economy, could have a material adverse effect on values of residential real estate properties. The volume of mortgage origination, mortgage refinancing and residential real estate transactions is highly variable. The level of real estate transactions are primarily affected by the average price of real estate sales, the availability of funds to finance purchases, mortgage interest rates, consumer confidence in the economy and general economic factors affecting the real estate markets. Reductions in these transaction volumes could have a material adverse effect on Xome\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could have, appear to have or be alleged to have conflicts of interest with Xome.\nXome provides services to us which could create, appear to create or be alleged to create conflicts of interest. By obtaining services from a subsidiary, there is risk of possible claims of collusion or claims that such services are not provided by Xome upon market terms. We have adopted policies, procedures and practices, and engage an independent third party to conduct a pricing study to ensure that the fees charged are customary and reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in eliminating all conflicts of interest or that third parties will refrain from making such allegations.\n18 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOther Risks\nTechnology failures or cyber-attacks against us or our vendors could damage our business operations and new laws and regulations could increase our costs.\nThe financial services industry as a whole is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, and system disruptions and failures caused by fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion (cyber-attack), computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters and other similar events may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our borrowers. Security breaches, acts of vandalism and developments in computer intrusion capabilities could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we or our vendors use to protect our borrowers\u2019 personal information and transaction data. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently, are becoming more sophisticated and are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties such as hackers, terrorists, persons involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our reliance on telecommunication technologies (including mobile devices), the internet and use of web-based product offerings.\nWhile we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, there can be no assurance that any such cyber intrusions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our or our vendors\u2019 systems or a defect in the integrity of our or our vendors\u2019 systems or cybersecurity could cause serious negative consequences for our business, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or operating systems and to those of our customers and counterparties. Any of the foregoing events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, increasing attention is being paid by the media, regulators and legislators to matters relating to cybersecurity, and regulators and legislators may enact laws or regulations regarding cybersecurity. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services has proposed regulations that are far-ranging in scope, including not only specific technical safeguards but also requirements regarding governance, incident planning, data management and system testing. New laws and regulations could result in significant compliance costs, which may adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe and our vendors have operations in India and/or the Philippines that could be adversely affected by changes in political or economic stability or by government policies.\nWe currently have operations located in India and expect to grow those operations, and we have reduced our costs by contracting with certain third parties with operations in India and the Philippines. These countries are subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. The political or regulatory climate in the United States, or elsewhere, also could change so that it would not be lawful or practical for us to use international operations in the manner in which we currently use them. If we or our vendors had to curtail or cease operations in these countries and transfer some or all of these operations to another geographic area, we would incur significant transition costs as well as higher future overhead costs that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d). Any violations of the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\nOur vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks.\nWe have significant vendors that, among other things, provide us with financial, technology and other services to support our businesses. With respect to vendors engaged to perform activities required by the applicable servicing criteria, we assess compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the applicable vendor or in certain cases require vendors to provide their own assessments and attestations) and are required to have procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor\u2019s activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. In the event that a vendor\u2019s activities do not comply with the servicing criteria, it could negatively impact our servicing agreements. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 19\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, regulatory, legal and reputational risk. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending and debt collection practices, foreclosures or evictions of elderly homeowners who default on reverse mortgages, technology failures, corporate governance, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can also result from media coverage, whether accurate or not. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, trading counterparties and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our customers and communities, this risk will always be present in our organization.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe operate within a highly regulated industry on a federal, state and local level and our business results are significantly impacted by the laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nAs a national mortgage services firm, we are subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that we do business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to expand our product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make our costs to service or originate loans higher, which could impact our financial results.\nRegulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") may promulgate could require changes in our business, result in increased compliance and operational costs and impair the profitability of such business. For example, in August 2016 the CFPB adopted rules regarding mortgage servicing practices, effective in August 2017, which will require significant modifications and enhancements to our mortgage servicing processes and systems. Additionally, the CFPB issued a rule, effective in 2018, amending Regulation C of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\"HMDA\") which will greatly expand the scope of data required to be collected and reported for every loan application from approximately 23 to 48 data elements. These new requirements for gathering and submitting large amounts of data regarding loan applications to regulators and the public is complex. Thus, any inadvertent errors in our gathering or reporting the data could result in fines or penalties being levied by the CFPB or other regulators against us. In addition, the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\"Dodd-Frank Act\"), could be expanded and we could be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs. The cumulative effect of these changes could result in a material impact on our earnings.\nWe could be subject to additional regulatory requirements or changes under the Dodd-Frank Act beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated. There also continues to be discussion of potential GSE reform which would likely affect markets for mortgages and mortgage securities in ways that cannot be predicted. In addition FHFA initiatives may be implemented by the GSEs that could materially affect the market for conventional and/or government insured loans. Historically, the regulatory environment has resulted not only in a tendency toward more regulation, but toward the most prescriptive regulation as regulatory agencies have generally taken a conservative approach to rule making, interpretive guidance and their general ongoing supervisory authority. Any changes in our current regulatory environment, including potential reform of the Dodd-Frank Act, could create uncertainty and result in increasing legal and compliance costs.\nThe implementation of the originations and servicing rules by the CFPB and the CFPB\u2019s continuing examinations of our business, could increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs and place restrictions on our operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n20 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nIn addition, certain regulators took steps to block the acquisition of MSRs by one of our competitors. It is possible that we could become subject to similar actions with respect to our acquisition of MSRs or other key business operations such as entering into subservicing contracts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous legal proceedings, federal, state or local governmental examinations and enforcement investigations. Some of these matters are highly complex and slow to develop, and results are difficult to predict or estimate.\nLegal Proceedings: We are routinely and currently involved in a significant number of legal proceedings concerning matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There is no assurance that the number of legal proceedings will not increase in the future, and it is possible that one or more class actions may be certified against us. These legal proceedings range from actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially tens of thousands of class members. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, employment, contract, tort, common law fraud and numerous other laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Service Member's Civil Relief Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Truth in Lending Act, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in violation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bankruptcy Code, False Claims Act and Making Home Affordable loan modification programs.\nAdditionally, along with others in our industry, we are subject to repurchase and indemnification claims and may continue to receive claims in the future, regarding alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to the sale of mortgage loans, the placement of mortgage loans into securitization trusts or the servicing of mortgage loans securitizations. We are also subject to legal actions or proceedings related to loss sharing and indemnification provisions of our various acquisitions.\nLitigation and other proceedings may require that we pay settlement costs, legal fees, damages, including punitive damages, penalties or other charges, or be subject to injunctive relief affecting our business practices, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, ongoing and other legal proceedings brought under state consumer protection statutes may result in a separate fine for each violation of the statute, which, particularly in the case of class action lawsuits, could result in damages substantially in excess of the amounts we earned from the underlying activities and that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. The costs of responding to the investigations can be substantial.\nRegulatory Matters: Our business is subject to extensive examinations, investigations and reviews by various federal, state and local regulatory and enforcement agencies. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below in Part I, Item 3. We have historically had a number of open investigations with various regulators or enforcement agencies. We have experienced an increase in regulatory and governmental investigations, subpoenas, examinations and other inquires. We are currently the subject of various regulatory or governmental investigations, subpoenas, examinations and inquiries related to our residential loan servicing and origination practices, bankruptcy and collections practices, our financial reporting and other aspects of our businesses. These matters include investigations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Executive Office of the United States Trustees, the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the multistate coalition of mortgage banking regulators, various State Attorneys General, New York Department of Financial Services, and the California Department of Business Oversight. Several large mortgage originators or servicers have been subject to similar matters, which have resulted in the payment of fines and penalties, changes to business practices and the entry of consent decrees or settlements. We continue to manage our response to each matter, but it is not possible for us to confidently or reliably predict the outcome of any of them, including predicting any possible losses resulting from any judgments or fines. Responding to these matters requires us to devote substantial legal and regulatory resources, resulting in higher costs which may adversely affect our cash flows.\nTo the extent that an examination or other regulatory engagement reveals a failure by us to comply with applicable law, regulation or licensing requirement this could lead to (i) loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our businesses, (ii) damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of client relationships, (iii) governmental investigations and enforcement actions, (iv) administrative fines and penalties and litigation, (v) civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits, and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities, (vi) enhanced compliance requirements, (vii) breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements, (viii) inability to raise capital and (ix) inability to execute on our business strategy. Any of these occurrences could further increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues, require us to change business practices and procedures and limit our ability to grow or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operation.\nNationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 21\nMoreover, regulatory changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory changes such as the CFPB having its own examination and enforcement authority and the \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could further increase the number of legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings against us. In addition, while we take numerous steps to prevent and detect employee misconduct, such as fraud, employee misconduct cannot always be deterred or prevented and could subject us to additional liability.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations in the mortgage industry.\nFederal, state and local governments have recently proposed or enacted numerous laws, regulations and rules related to mortgage loans generally and loan modifications as well as foreclosure actions. These laws, regulations and rules may result in delays in the foreclosure process, reduced payments by borrowers, modification of the original terms of mortgage loans, permanent forgiveness of debt and increased servicing advances.\nDue to the highly regulated nature of the residential mortgage industry, we are required to comply with a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate, among other things, the manner in which we conduct our servicing, originations and ancillary business and the fees we may charge. These regulations directly impact our business and require constant compliance, which includes enhancing our compliance program, procedures and controls, monitoring and internal and external audits. A failure in maintaining an effective compliance program or a material failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could subject us to lawsuits or governmental actions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there continue to be changes in legislation and licensing, which require technology changes and additional implementation costs for loan originators. We expect legislative changes will continue in the foreseeable future, which may increase our operating expenses.\nFurthermore, there continue to be changes in state laws that are adverse to mortgage servicers that increase costs and operational complexity of our business and impose significant penalties for violation.\nAny of these changes in law could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnlike competitors that are national banks, we are subject to state licensing and operational requirements that result in substantial compliance costs.\nBecause we are not a depository institution, we do not benefit from a federal exemption to state mortgage banking, loan servicing or debt collection licensing and regulatory requirements. We must comply with state licensing requirements and varying compliance requirements in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and we are sensitive to regulatory changes that may increase our costs through stricter licensing laws, disclosure laws or increased fees or that may impose conditions to licensing that we or our personnel are unable to meet. In addition, we are subject to periodic examinations by state regulators, which can result in refunds to borrowers of certain fees earned by us, and we may be required to pay substantial penalties imposed by state regulators due to compliance errors. For example, the Company made refunds to certain borrowers in 2015 related to delays in consummating their loan modifications that were transferred from prior servicers. Future state legislation and changes in existing regulation may significantly increase our compliance costs or reduce the amount of ancillary revenues, including late fees that we may charge to borrowers. This could make our business cost-prohibitive in the affected state or states and could materially affect our business.\nOur business would be adversely affected if we lose our licenses.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. In most states in which we operate, a regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to mortgage servicing companies and mortgage originations companies such as us as well as regulating our ancillary service providers. These rules and regulations generally provide for licensing as a mortgage servicing company, mortgage originations company or third-party debt default specialist, title insurance agency, appraisal management company, licensed auctioneer, and other similar types of requirements as to the form and content of contracts and other documentation, licensing of our employees and employee hiring background checks, licensing of independent contractors with which we contract, restrictions on certain practices, disclosure and record-keeping requirements and enforcement of borrowers\u2019 rights. We are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities.\n22 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. We may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing or other agreements and have a material adverse effect on our operations. The states that currently do not provide extensive regulation of our businesses may later choose to do so, and if such states so act, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all requisite licenses and permits. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing agreements and have a material adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, the adoption of additional, or the revision of existing, rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur increased litigation costs and related losses if a borrower, or class of borrowers, challenges the validity of a foreclosure action or if a court overturns a foreclosure or if a loan we are servicing becomes subordinate to a Home Owners Association lien.\nWe may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur increased litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or a class of borrowers under a variety of theories including, without limitation, standing, proper notice and statute of limitations. In addition, if a court rules that the lien of a Homeowners Association takes priority over the lien we service, we may incur legal liabilities and costs to defend such actions. If a court dismisses or overturns a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the loan owner, a borrower, title insurer or the purchaser of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. A significant increase in litigation costs could adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for an advance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResidential mortgage foreclosure proceedings in certain states have been delayed due to lack of judicial resources and legislation, all of which could have a negative effect on our ability to liquidate loans timely and slow the recovery of advances and thus impact our earnings or liquidity.\nIn some states, such as New York, our industry has faced, and may continue to face, increased delays and costs caused by state law and local court rules and processes. In addition, California and Nevada have enacted Homeowner\u2019s Bill of Rights legislation to establish mandatory loss mitigation practices for homeowners which cause delays in foreclosure proceedings. Delays in foreclosure proceedings could also require us to make additional servicing advances by drawing on our servicing advance facilities, or delay the recovery of advances, all or any of which could materially affect our earnings and liquidity and increase our need for capital.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may experience substantial volatility which may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. For example, the closing market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange fluctuated between $8.29 per share and $57.45 per share from 2013 through 2016 and may continue to fluctuate. The volatility may affect your ability to sell shares of our common stock at an advantageous price. Market price fluctuations in shares of our common stock may be due to reduced liquidity resulting from highly concentrated ownership of shares of our common stock, acquisitions, dispositions or other material public announcements along with a variety of additional factors.\nNationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K 23\nIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nFIF HE Holdings LLC (\"FIF\"), which is primarily owned by certain private equity funds managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (\"Fortress\"), owns approximately 69% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, FIF owns shares sufficient for the majority vote over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by other stockholders. The interests of FIF may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, FIF may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to other stockholders or adversely affect us or other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders. On February 14, 2017, SoftBank Group Corp. (\"SoftBank\") and Fortress announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which SoftBank intends to acquire Fortress. There are no assurances that the acquisition of Fortress by SoftBank will not have an impact on us.\nCertain provisions of our stockholders agreement with FIF (\"Stockholders Agreement\"), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThese provisions provide for:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as FIF and certain other affiliates of Fortress and permitted transferees (collectively, the Fortress Stockholders) beneficially own at least 40% of our issued and outstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);\n\u2022\nprovisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as the Fortress Stockholders beneficially own at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock, any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain rights to the Fortress Stockholders with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our Board of Directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our Board of Directors for so long as the Fortress Stockholders continue to beneficially own at least 40% of our issued and outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nno provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;\n\u2022\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws only permit action by our stockholders outside a meeting by unanimous written consent, provided, however, that for so long as the Fortress Stockholders beneficially own at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock, our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nunder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.\n24 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nIn addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by FIF, our management or our Board of Directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and Board of Directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\nCertain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, and their affiliates are not obligated to enter into future transactions with us.\nFortress has other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, FIF has the right, and has no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If FIF or any of its officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.\nIn the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of FIF acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person's capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then to the fullest extent permitted by law such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person's fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us, if FIF pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if FIF does not present the corporate opportunity to us.\nAdditionally, we may continue to enter into transactions with Fortress and its affiliates such as servicing or subservicing mortgage loans, selling a percentage of the excess cash flow generated from our MSRs or selling the rights to mortgage servicing rights, and servicer advances related to loan pools. These transactions may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. Such transactions may present an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest. Additionally, Fortress and its affiliates are under no obligation to enter into any future transactions with us on the same terms as prior transactions, or at all, which could impact our business strategy.\nWe are not required to repurchase our common stock or senior notes, and any such repurchases may not result in effects we anticipated.\nWe have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock through December 31, 2017, to repurchase our outstanding senior notes as long as certain liquidity requirements are met and to redeem certain tranches of our outstanding senior notes (collectively, the \"repurchases\"). We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares or senior notes. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, depends on several factors, including market and business conditions, the market price of shares of our common stock and senior notes and our overall capital structure and liquidity position, including the nature of other potential uses of cash, including investments in growth. There can be no assurance that any repurchases will have the effects we anticipated, and our repurchases will utilize cash that we will not be able to use in other ways, whether to grow the business or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 13299, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "NSM"}
