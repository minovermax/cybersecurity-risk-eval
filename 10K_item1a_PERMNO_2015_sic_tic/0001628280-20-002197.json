{"cik": "1521036", "company": "Lantheus Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our outstanding common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Current Products and Revenues\nThe growth of our business is substantially dependent on our ability to continue to grow the appropriate use of DEFINITY in suboptimal echocardiograms in the face of increased segment competition from other existing echocardiography agents and potential generic competitors as a result of future patent and regulatory exclusivity expirations.\nThe growth of our business is substantially dependent on our ability to continue to grow the appropriate use of DEFINITY in suboptimal echocardiograms. There were approximately 35.1 million echocardiograms in 2019 according to a third-party source. Assuming 20% of echocardiograms produce suboptimal images, as stated in the clinical literature, we estimate that approximately 7.0 million echocardiograms in 2019 produced suboptimal images. We estimate that DEFINITY held over 80% of the U.S. market for contrast agents in echocardiography procedures as of December 31, 2019. DEFINITY currently competes with Optison, a GE Healthcare product, Lumason, a Bracco product (known as SonoVue outside the U.S.), as well as echocardiography without contrast and other non-echocardiography agents.\nWe launched DEFINITY in 2001, and we continue to actively pursue patents in connection with DEFINITY, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we have an Orange Book-listed method of use patent expiring in March 2037 and additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed expiring in 2021, 2023 and 2037. Outside of the U.S., while our DEFINITY patent protection and regulatory exclusivity have generally expired, we are currently prosecuting additional patents to try to obtain similar method of use and manufacturing patent protection as granted in the U.S. We were also recently granted a composition of matter patent on the modified formulation of DEFINITY which runs through December 2035. If the modified formulation is approved by the FDA, then this patent would be eligible to be listed in the Orange Book.\nBecause our Orange Book-listed composition of matter patent expired in June 2019, we may face generic DEFINITY challengers in the near to intermediate term. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA can approve ANDAs for generic versions of drugs before the expiration of an Orange Book-listed patent covering the innovator product if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that (i) its generic candidate is the same as the innovator product by establishing bioequivalence and providing relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data, and (ii) the marketing of that generic candidate does not infringe an Orange Book-listed patent or the Orange Book-listed patent is invalid. With respect to any Orange Book-listed patent covering the innovator product that expires after the ANDA applicant intends to begin commercialization, the ANDA applicant must certify that its generic candidate will not infringe the innovator\u2019s Orange Book-listed patents or that the Orange Book-listed patents are invalid. The ANDA applicant must also give Notice to the innovator, which would then enable the innovator to challenge the ANDA applicant in court within 45 days of receiving such Notice. If the innovator challenges the ANDA applicant in court in a timely manner, then FDA approval to commercialize the generic candidate will be stayed (that is, delayed) for up to 30 months while the dispute between the innovator and the ANDA applicant is resolved in court. The 30 month stay can be shortened if the patent infringement suit is resolved in the ANDA applicant\u2019s favor before the 30 month stay expires, and this may involve a successful challenge of the patent\u2019s validity in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, proceedings and appeals process.\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not received any such Notice from any ANDA applicant but can give no assurance that we will not receive a Notice in the future. If we were to receive any such Notice in the future, we would review the Notice, evaluate the strength of any potential patent infringement claims, and be prepared to challenge the ANDA applicant in a timely fashion, which would thereby trigger the stay of up to 30 months. We can give no assurance that we would have grounds to file a patent infringement suit, that we would obtain the full 30 month stay, that we would be successful on the merits asserting that a generic candidate infringes our Orange Book-listed patent, or that we would be successful defending the validity of our Orange Book-listed patent in court or in a USPTO adversarial proceeding.\nAs part of our microbubble franchise strategy, (i) we are developing a modified formulation of DEFINITY, (ii) we look for other opportunities to expand our microbubble franchise, including new applications beyond echocardiography and contrast imaging generally such as our strategic arrangements with Cerevast and CarThera, and (iii) we continue to build specialized in-house manufacturing capabilities at our North Billerica facility for DEFINITY and, potentially, other products. However, we can give no assurance that our microbubble franchise strategy will be successful or that new manufacturing capabilities, a new indication, a modified formulation or new applications will grow our microbubble franchise.\nWe have on-going development and technology transfer activities for our modified formulation with SBL located in South Korea but can give no assurances as to when or if those development and technology transfer activities will be completed and when we will begin to receive a supply of our modified formulation from SBL. In addition, potential global disruptions in air transport due to COVID-19 (coronavirus) could adversely affect our ability to receive a supply of our modified formulation from SBL, which, depending upon the magnitude and duration of such disruptions, could delay the commercial launch of our modified formulation.\nIf we are not able to continue to (i) grow DEFINITY sales, which depend on one or more of the growth of echocardiograms, the growth in the appropriate use of contrast in suboptimal echocardiograms, and our ability to sustain and grow our leading position in the U.S. echocardiography contrast market, or (ii) be successful with our microbubble franchise strategy, we may not be able to continue to grow the revenue and cash flow of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global supply of Mo-99 is fragile and not stable. Our dependence on a limited number of third party suppliers for Mo-99 could prevent us from delivering some of our products to our customers in the required quantities, within the required timeframe, or at all, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues.\nA critical ingredient of TechneLite is Mo-99. We currently purchase finished Mo-99 from three of the four main processing sites in the world, namely IRE in Belgium, NTP in South Africa and ANSTO in Australia. These processing sites provide us Mo-99 from five of the six main Mo-99-producing reactors in the world, namely BR2 in Belgium, LVR-15 in the Czech Republic, HFR in The Netherlands, SAFARI in South Africa and OPAL in Australia.\nThe NTP processing facility had periodic outages in 2017, 2018 and 2019. When NTP was not producing, we relied on Mo-99 supply from both IRE and ANSTO to limit the impact of the NTP outages. In the second quarter of 2019, ANSTO experienced facility issues in its existing Mo-99 processing facility which resulted in a decrease in Mo-99 available to us. In addition, as ANSTO transitioned from its existing Mo-99 processing facility to its new Mo-99 processing facility in the second quarter of 2019, ANSTO experienced start-up and transition challenges, which also resulted in a decrease in Mo-99 available to us. Further, starting in late June 2019 and through the date of this filing, ANSTO\u2019s new Mo-99 processing facility has experienced unscheduled production outages, and we are now relying on IRE and NTP to limit the impact of those ANSTO outages. Because of these various supply chain constraints, depending on reactor and processor schedules and operations, we have not been able to fill some or all of the demand for our TechneLite generators on certain manufacturing days, consequently decreasing revenue and cash flow from this product line during the outage periods as compared to prior periods.\nANSTO\u2019s new Mo-99 processing facility, could eventually increase ANSTO\u2019s production capacity from approximately 2,000 curies per week to 3,500 curies per week with additional committed financial and operational resources. At full ramp-up capacity, ANSTO\u2019s new facility could provide incremental supply to our globally diversified Mo-99 supply chain and therefore mitigate some risk among our Mo-99 suppliers, although we can give no assurances to that effect, and a prolonged disruption of service from one of our three Mo-99 processing sites or one of their main Mo-99-producing reactors could have a substantial negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are also pursuing additional sources of Mo-99 from potential new producers around the world to further augment our current supply. In November 2014, we entered into a strategic arrangement with SHINE for the future supply of Mo-99. Under the terms of the supply agreement, SHINE will provide Mo-99 produced using its proprietary LEU-solution technology for use in our TechneLite generators once SHINE\u2019s facility becomes operational and receives all necessary regulatory approvals, which SHINE now estimates will occur in 2022. However, we cannot assure you that SHINE or any other possible additional sources of Mo-99 will result in commercial quantities of Mo-99 for our business, or that these new suppliers together with our current suppliers will be able to deliver a sufficient quantity of Mo-99 to meet our needs.\nU.S., Canadian and international governments have encouraged the development of a number of alternative Mo-99 production projects with existing reactors and technologies as well as new technologies. However, we cannot say when, or if, the Mo-99 produced from these projects will become available. As a result, there is a limited amount of Mo-99 available which could limit the quantity of TechneLite that we could manufacture, sell and distribute, resulting in a further substantial negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of the global suppliers of Mo-99 rely on Framatone-CERCA in France to fabricate uranium targets and in some cases fuel for research reactors from which Mo-99 is produced. Absent a new supplier, a supply disruption relating to uranium targets or fuel could have a substantial negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, because we source our radioisotopes almost exclusively from international suppliers, potential global disruptions in air transport due to COVID-19 (coronavirus) could adversely affect our international supply chain for radioisotopes which, depending upon the magnitude and duration of such disruptions, could have a substantial negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe instability of the global supply of Mo-99, including supply shortages, has resulted in increases in the cost of Mo-99, which has negatively affected our margins, and more restrictive agreements with suppliers, which could further increase our costs.\nWith the general instability in the global supply of Mo-99, we have faced substantial increases in the cost of Mo-99 in comparison to historical costs. We expect these cost increases to continue in the future as the Mo-99 suppliers move closer to a full cost recovery business model. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) defines full cost recovery as the identification of all of the costs of production and recovering these costs from the market. While we are generally able to pass Mo-99 cost increases on to our customers in our customer contracts, if we are not able to do so in the future, our margins may decline further with respect to our TechneLite generators, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of a substantial portion of our products could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities, within the required timeframes, or at all, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues.\nWe obtain a substantial portion of our products from third party manufacturers and suppliers. We rely on JHS as our sole source manufacturer of DEFINITY, Neurolite, Cardiolite and evacuation vials. We currently have additional on-going technology transfer activities for a modified formulation of DEFINITY with SBL. We currently believe that if approved by the FDA, the modified formulation could become commercially available in early 2021, although that timing cannot be assured. Currently, our DEFINITY, Neurolite, Cardiolite, evacuation vial and saline product supplies are approved for manufacture by a single manufacturer.\nBased on our current estimates, we believe that we will have sufficient supply of DEFINITY, Neurolite, Cardiolite and evacuation vials from JHS, and sufficient supply of saline from our sole manufacturer, to meet expected demand. However, we can give no assurances that JHS or our other manufacturing partner will be able to manufacture and distribute our products in a high quality and timely manner and in sufficient quantities to allow us to avoid product stock-outs and shortfalls. Currently, regulatory authorities in certain countries have not yet approved JHS as a manufacturer of certain of our products. Accordingly, until those regulatory approvals have been obtained, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will continue to be adversely affected.\nXenon is captured as a by-product of the Mo-99 production process. We receive bulk unprocessed Xenon from IRE resulting from HEU Mo-99 production, which we process and finish for our customers. We do not yet receive Xenon resulting from LEU Mo-99 production at IRE and can give no assurances as to the timing of the availability of LEU Xenon. We believe we will have a sufficient supply of HEU and LEU Xenon to meet our customers\u2019 needs. However, until IRE converts to LEU Xenon production or we can qualify an additional source of bulk unprocessed Xenon, we will rely on IRE as a sole source provider of HEU Xenon.\nIn addition to the products described above, for reasons of quality assurance or cost-effectiveness, we purchase certain components and raw materials from sole suppliers (including, for example, the lead casing for our TechneLite generators and the lipid blend material used in the processing of DEFINITY). Because we do not control the actual production of many of the products we sell and many of the raw materials and components that make up the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on events and conditions outside of our control. At our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, we manufacture TechneLite on a highly automated production line, as well as Thallium and Gallium using our older cyclotron technology and Xenon and Quadramet using our hot cell infrastructure. As with all manufacturing facilities, equipment and infrastructure age and become subject to increasing maintenance and repair. If we or one of our manufacturing partners experiences an event, including a labor dispute, natural disaster, fire, power outage, machinery breakdown, security problem, failure to meet regulatory requirements, product quality issue, technology transfer issue or other issue, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or on the forecasted schedule, if at all. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the governing regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly restart manufacturing at a third party or our own facility or establish additional or replacement sources for certain products, components or materials.\nIn addition to our existing manufacturing relationships, we are also pursuing new manufacturing relationships to establish and secure additional or alternative suppliers for our commercial products. We currently have additional on-going technology transfer activities for a modified formulation of DEFINITY with SBL. We are also in the final stages of an extensive, multi-year effort to add specialized manufacturing capabilities at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility. This project is part of a larger corporate growth strategy to create a competitive advantage in specialized manufacturing. This project should not only deliver efficiencies and supply chain redundancy for our current portfolio but also should afford us increased flexibility as we consider external opportunities. However, we cannot assure you that these activities or any of our additional supply activities will be successful or that we will be able to avoid or mitigate interim supply shortages before new sources of product are fully functional and qualified. In addition, we cannot assure you that our existing manufacturers or suppliers or any new manufacturers or suppliers can adequately maintain either their financial health, technical capabilities or regulatory compliance to allow continued production and supply. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could eventually have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur just-in-time manufacturing of radiopharmaceutical products relies on the timely receipt of radioactive raw materials and the timely shipment of finished goods, and any disruption of our supply or distribution networks could have a negative effect on our business.\nBecause a number of our radiopharmaceutical products, including our TechneLite generators, rely on radioisotopes with limited half-lives, we must manufacture, finish and distribute these products on a just-in-time basis, because the underlying radioisotope is in a constant state of radio decay. For example, if we receive Mo-99 in the morning of a manufacturing day for TechneLite generators, then we will generally ship finished generators to customers by the end of that same business day. Shipment of generators may be by next day delivery services or by either ground or air custom logistics. Any delay in us receiving radioisotopes from suppliers or being able to have finished products delivered to customers because of weather or other unforeseen transportation issues could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChallenges with product quality or product performance, including defects, caused by us or our suppliers could result in a decrease in customers and revenues, unexpected expenses and loss of market share.\nThe manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex and must meet stringent quality requirements, due in part to strict regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s cGMPs. Problems may be identified or arise during manufacturing quality review, packaging or shipment for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors. Additionally, manufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off-label uses or inadequate disclosure of product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. Those events could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products. We also may undertake voluntarily to recall products or temporarily shut down production lines based on internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data.\nQuality, regulatory and recall challenges could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs to replace products, lost revenue, damage to customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and costs of any possible settlements or judgments related thereto and potentially cause similar losses with respect to other products. These challenges could also divert the attention of our management and employees from operational, commercial or other business efforts. If we deliver products with defects, or if there is a perception that our products or the processes related to our products contain errors or defects, we could incur additional recall and product liability costs, and our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be materially adversely affected. Due to the strong name recognition of our brands, an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals. These challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the U.S., we are heavily dependent on a few large customers and group purchasing organization arrangements to generate a majority of our revenues for our nuclear medical imaging products and our other products. Outside of the U.S., we rely primarily on distributors to generate a substantial portion of our revenue.\nIn the U.S., we have historically relied on a limited number of radiopharmacy customers, primarily GE Healthcare, Cardinal, UPPI, Jubilant Radiopharma and PharmaLogic, to distribute our current largest volume nuclear imaging products. Among the existing radiopharmacies in the U.S., continued consolidations, divestitures and reorganizations may have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We generally have distribution arrangements with our major radiopharmacy customers pursuant to multi-year contracts, each of which is subject to renewal. If these contracts are terminated prior to expiration of their term, or are not renewed, or are renewed on terms that are less favorable to us, then such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFor all of our medical imaging products, we continue to experience significant pricing pressures from our competitors, large customers and group purchasing organizations, and any significant, additional pricing pressures could lead to a reduction in revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOutside of the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, we have no sales force and, consequently, rely on third-party distributors, either on a country-by-country basis or on a multi-country, regional basis, to market, sell and distribute our products. In Canada, we maintain our own direct sales force to sell DEFINITY. We formerly owned or operated radiopharmacies and we now sell radiopharmaceutical products under the Isologic Supply Agreement. In Australia, we also formerly owned or operated radiopharmacies, and we now sell DEFINITY and radiopharmaceutical products under the GMS Supply Agreement. In certain circumstances, distributors may also sell competing products to our own or products for competing diagnostic modalities and may have incentives to shift sales towards those competing products. As a result, we cannot assure you that our international distributors will increase or maintain current levels of unit sales or that we will be able to increase or maintain our current unit pricing, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition in our business and may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for diagnostic medical imaging agents is highly competitive and continually evolving. Our principal competitors in existing diagnostic modalities include large, global companies with substantial financial, manufacturing, sales and marketing and logistics resources that are more diversified than ours, such as GE Healthcare, Bracco, Curium and Jubilant Life Sciences, as well as other competitors, including NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes. We cannot anticipate their actions in the same or competing diagnostic modalities, such as significant price reductions on products that are comparable to our own, development or introduction of new products that are more cost-effective or have superior performance than our current products, the introduction of generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection or the new entry into a generic market in which we are already a participant. In addition, distributors of our products could attempt to shift end-users to competing diagnostic modalities and products. Our current or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of these activities. Our failure to compete effectively could cause us to lose market share to our competitors and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurther, the radiopharmaceutical industry continues to evolve strategically, with several market participants either recently sold or for sale. In addition, the supply-demand dynamics of the industry are complex because of large market positions of some participants, legacy businesses, government subsidies (in particular, relating to the manufacture of radioisotopes), and group purchasing arrangements. We cannot predict what impact new owners and new operators may have on the strategic decision-making of our competitors, customers and suppliers, and such decision-making could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Reimbursement and Regulation\nCertain of our customers are highly dependent on payments from third party payors, including government sponsored programs, particularly Medicare, in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and reductions in third party coverage and reimbursement rates for our products (or services provided with our products) could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our revenue depends, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products purchased by our customers (or services provided with our products) are reimbursed by third party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, other U.S. government sponsored programs, non-U.S. governmental payors and private payors. These third party payors exercise significant control over patient access and increasingly use their enhanced bargaining power to secure discounted rates and impose other requirements that may reduce demand for our products. Our potential customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for products and services from these third party payors affects the selection of products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. For example, certain radiopharmaceuticals, when used for non-invasive imaging of the perfusion of the heart for the diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, are currently subject to a Medicare National Coverage Determination (\u201cNCD\u201d). The NCD permits the coverage of such radiopharmaceuticals only when certain criteria are met. Our PET pipeline product flurpiridaz F 18, if approved, may become subject to this NCD, and may not be covered at all. If Medicare and other third party payors do not provide adequate reimbursement for the costs of our products (or services provided using our products), deny the coverage of the products (or those services), or reduce current levels of reimbursement, healthcare professionals may not prescribe our products and providers and suppliers may not purchase our products. In addition, demand for new products may be limited unless we obtain favorable reimbursement policies (including coverage, coding and payment) from governmental and private third party payors at the time of the product\u2019s introduction, which will depend, in part, on our ability to demonstrate that a new agent has a positive impact on clinical outcomes. Third party payors continually review their coverage policies for existing and new products and procedures and can deny coverage for procedures that include the use of our products or revise payment policies such that payments do not adequately cover the cost of our products. Even if third party payors make coverage and reimbursement available, that reimbursement may not be adequate or these payors\u2019 reimbursement policies may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOver the past several years, Medicare has implemented numerous changes to payment policies for imaging procedures in both the hospital setting and non-hospital settings (which include physician offices and freestanding imaging facilities). Some of these changes have had a negative impact on utilization of imaging services. Examples of these changes include:\n\u2022\nLimiting payments for imaging services in physician offices and free-standing imaging facility settings based upon rates paid to hospital outpatient departments;\n\u2022\nReducing payments for certain imaging procedures when performed together with other imaging procedures in the same family of procedures on the same patient on the same day in the physician office and free-standing imaging facility setting;\n\u2022\nMaking significant revisions to the methodology for determining the practice expense component of the Medicare payment applicable to the physician office and free-standing imaging facility setting which results in a reduction in payment;\n\u2022\nRevising payment policies and reducing payment amounts for imaging procedures performed in the hospital outpatient setting; and\n\u2022\nReducing prospective payment levels for applicable diagnosis-related groups in the hospital inpatient setting.\nIn the physician office and free-standing imaging facility setting, services provided using our products are reimbursed under the Medicare physician fee schedule. Since 2015, payments under the Medicare physician fee schedule have been subject to specific annual updates: a 0.5% update through 2018; a 0.25% update in 2019; no updates from 2020 to 2025; and, beginning in 2026, differential updates based on whether the physician participates in advanced alternative payment models (with 0.75% updates for qualifying participants and 0.25% updates for non-qualifying participants) (which may be subject to budget neutrality adjustments). Since 2019, fee schedule payments have been adjusted for certain physicians based on their performance under a consolidated measurement system (that measures performance with respect to quality, resource utilization, meaningful use of certified electronic health records technology, and clinical practice improvement activities). From 2019 through payment year 2024, physicians may be eligible for a bonus based on the use of certain alternative payment models designated as \u201cadvanced\u201d by CMS. The ongoing and future impact of these changes cannot be determined at this time.\nWe believe that Medicare changes to payment policies for imaging procedures applicable to non-hospital settings will continue to result in certain physician practices ceasing to provide these services and a further shifting of where certain medical imaging procedures are performed, from the physician office and free-standing imaging facility settings to the hospital outpatient setting. Changes applicable to Medicare payment in the hospital outpatient setting could also influence the decisions by hospital outpatient physicians to perform procedures that involve our products. Within the hospital outpatient setting, CMS payment policy is such that the use of many of our products are not separately payable by Medicare, although certain new drug products are eligible for separate (incremental) payment for the first three years after approval. Since 2013, although Medicare generally does not provide separate payment to hospitals for the use of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals administered in an outpatient setting, CMS has had a policy to make a nominal additional payment ($10) to hospitals that utilize products with non-HEU, meaning the product is 95% derived from non-HEU sources. This payment policy continues in 2020. Although some of our TechneLite generators are manufactured using non-HEU, not all of our TechneLite generators currently meet CMS\u2019s definition of non-HEU, and therefore this payment is not available for doses produced by the latter category of TechneLite generators used by our customers. Changes to the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system payment rates, including reductions implemented for certain hospital outpatient sites, could influence the decisions by hospital outpatient physicians to perform procedures that involve our products.\nWe also believe that all these changes and their resulting pressures may incrementally reduce the overall number of diagnostic medical imaging procedures performed. These changes overall could slow the acceptance and introduction of next-generation imaging equipment into the marketplace, which, in turn, could adversely impact the future market adoption of certain of our imaging agents already in the market or currently in development. We expect that there will continue to be proposals to reduce or limit Medicare and Medicaid payment for diagnostic services.\nWe also expect increased regulation and oversight of advanced diagnostic testing in which our products are used. Beginning January 1, 2020, a professional who is ordering advanced diagnostic imaging services (which include MRI, CT, nuclear medicine (including PET) and other advanced diagnostic imaging services that the Secretary of HHS may specify) must consult a qualified clinical decision support mechanism, as identified by HHS, to determine whether the ordered service adheres to specified appropriate use criteria (\u201cAUC\u201d). Reimbursement penalties will apply in 2021 if this requirement is not met (and documented on the claim). To the extent that these types of changes have the effect of reducing the aggregate number of diagnostic medical imaging procedures performed in the U.S., our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nReforms to the U.S. healthcare system may adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our patient volume is derived from U.S. government healthcare programs, principally Medicare, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The law contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and medical imaging procedures in which our drug products are used and/or that could potentially reduce the aggregate number of diagnostic medical imaging procedures performed in the U.S. Subsequently, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 significantly revised the methodology for updating the Medicare physician fee schedule. And more recently, Congress enacted legislation in 2017 that eliminated the Healthcare Reform Act\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d beginning in 2019 Congress continues to consider other healthcare reform legislation. There is no assurance that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent Congressional actions includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit. These provisions have resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in payor mix and reimbursement by private third party payors may also affect our business. Rates paid by some private third party payors are based, in part, on established physician, clinic and hospital charges and are generally higher than Medicare payment rates. Reductions in the amount of reimbursement paid for diagnostic medical imaging procedures and changes in the mix of our patients between non-governmental payors and government sponsored healthcare programs and among different types of non-government payor sources, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe full impact on our business of healthcare reforms and other new laws, or changes in existing laws, is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether additional legislative changes will be adopted or how those changes would affect our industry in general or our ability to successfully commercialize our products or develop new products.\nOur business and industry are subject to complex and costly regulations. If government regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, exclusion and other material limitations on our operations.\nBoth before and after the approval of our products and agents in development, we, our products, development agents, operations, facilities, suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers, contract research organizations and contract testing laboratories are subject to extensive and, in certain circumstances, expanding regulation by federal, state and local government agencies in the U.S. as well as non-U.S. and transnational laws and regulations, with regulations differing from country to country, including, among other things, anti-trust and competition laws and regulations and the recently enacted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d). In the U.S., the FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, potency, labeling, storage, record keeping, quality systems, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, and import and export of drug products. We are required to register our business for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with the stringent requirements of the FDA, the NRC, the HHS, Health Canada, the EMA, the MHRA, the CFDA, state and provincial boards of pharmacy, state and provincial health departments and other federal, state and provincial agencies.\nUnder U.S. law, for example, we are required to report certain adverse events and production problems, if any, to the FDA. We also have similar adverse event and production reporting obligations outside of the U.S., including to the EMA and MHRA. Additionally, we must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products, including the prohibition on the promotion of our products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA or a so-called \u201coff-label use\u201d or promotion that is inconsistent with the approved labeling. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials constitute unlawful promotion, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures at our own facility and at third party suppliers must conform to cGMP regulations and other applicable law after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs and other applicable law, and, from time to time, makes those cGMPs more stringent. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. If in the future issues arise at a third party manufacturer, the FDA could take regulatory action which could limit or suspend the ability of that third party to manufacture our products or have any additional products approved at the relevant facility for manufacture until the issues are resolved and remediated. Such a limitation or suspension could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that govern financial and other arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, including federal and state anti-kickback statutes, federal and state false claims laws and regulations and other fraud and abuse laws and regulations.\nWe must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid drug rebate program, the \u201cfederal ceiling price\u201d drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. We must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid drug rebate program and Medicare Part B. As a specific example, in 2010, we entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement with the federal government for some but not all of our products, and in 2016 entered into a separate Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement for the balance of our products. These agreements require us to report certain price information to the federal government. Determination of the rebate amount that we pay to state Medicaid programs for our products, of prices charged to government and certain private payors for our products, or of amounts paid for our products under government healthcare programs, depends upon information reported by us to the government. If we provide customers or government officials with inaccurate information about the products\u2019 pricing or eligibility for coverage, or the products fail to satisfy coverage requirements, we could be terminated from the rebate program, be excluded from participation in government healthcare programs, or be subject to potential liability under the False Claims Act or other laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with other requirements and restrictions placed upon us or our third party manufacturers or suppliers by laws and regulations can result in fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and debarment. Possible consequences of those actions could include:\n\u2022\nSubstantial modifications to our business practices and operations;\n\u2022\nSignificantly reduced demand for our products (if products become ineligible for reimbursement under federal and state healthcare programs);\n\u2022\nA total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of the facilities where our products are produced while the alleged violation is being remediated;\n\u2022\nDelays in or the inability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals; and\n\u2022\nWithdrawals or suspensions of our current products from the market.\nRegulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may also increase our costs or reduce sales. Violation of any of these regulatory schemes, individually or collectively, could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur marketing and sales practices may contain risks that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to numerous domestic (federal, state and local) and foreign laws addressing fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including the FCA and federal Anti-Kickback Statute, self-referral laws, the FCPA, the Bribery Act, FDA promotional restrictions, the federal disclosure (sunshine) law and state marketing and disclosure (sunshine) laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as well as health programs outside the U.S., and even settlement of alleged violations can result in the imposition of corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to additional compliance and reporting requirements and impact our business practices. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to changing interpretation and application, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. Even minor and inadvertent irregularities could potentially give rise to a charge that the law has been violated. Although we believe we maintain an appropriate compliance program, we cannot be certain that the program will adequately detect or prevent violations and/or the relevant regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation. Additionally, if there is a change in law, regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change one or more of our business practices to be in compliance with these laws. Required changes could be costly and time consuming.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of these laws or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, or exclusion from state and federal healthcare programs including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of December 31, 2019, and as a result, we will have to comply with increased disclosure and compliance requirements.\nBased on the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates which exceeded $700 million as of the last business day of June 2019, we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d but will instead be deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as of December 31, 2019.\nAs a large accelerated filer, we will be subject to certain disclosure and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies but that did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nCompliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022\nThe requirement that we provide full and more detailed disclosures regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nThe requirement that we hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect that the loss of emerging growth company status and compliance with the additional requirements of being a large accelerated filer will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and costs associated with investor relations activities, and cause management and other personnel to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to public company reporting requirements. In addition, if we are not able to comply with changing requirements in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2019, we are required to implement additional procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, and we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the necessary deadline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Since we are deemed a large accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls on an annual basis beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management and independent\nregistered public accounting firm to assess our internal controls are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation of our existing controls and the incurrence of significant additional expenditures. In connection with our evaluation of our internal controls, we may need to upgrade systems, including information technology; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us or our independent registered public accounting firm conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Internal control deficiencies could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Internal control deficiencies could also result in a restatement of our financial results in the future. We could become subject to stockholder or other third party litigation, as well as investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions, payment of damages or other remedies. Further, any delay in compliance with the auditor attestation provisions of Section 404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including ineligibility for short-form resale registration, action by the SEC and the suspension or delisting of our common stock, which could reduce the trading price of our common stock and could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Safety\nUltrasound contrast agents may cause side effects which could limit our ability to sell DEFINITY.\nDEFINITY is an ultrasound contrast agent based on perflutren lipid microspheres. In 2007, the FDA received reports of deaths and serious cardiopulmonary reactions following the administration of ultrasound micro-bubble contrast agents used in echocardiography. Four of the 11 reported deaths were caused by cardiac arrest occurring either during or within 30 minutes following the administration of the contrast agent; most of the serious but non-fatal reactions also occurred in this time frame. As a result, in October 2007, the FDA requested that we and GE Healthcare, which distributes Optison, a competitor to DEFINITY, add a boxed warning to these products emphasizing the risk for serious cardiopulmonary reactions and that the use of these products was contraindicated in certain patients. In a strong reaction by the cardiology community to the FDA\u2019s new position, a letter was sent to the FDA, signed by 161 doctors, stating that the benefit of these ultrasound contrast agents outweighed the risks and urging that the boxed warning be removed. In May 2008, the FDA substantially modified the boxed warning. On May 2, 2011, the FDA held an advisory committee meeting to consider the status of ultrasound micro-bubble contrast agents and the boxed warning. In October 2011, we received FDA approval of further modifications to the DEFINITY label, including: further relaxing the boxed warning; eliminating the sentence in the Indication and Use section \u201cThe safety and efficacy of DEFINITY with exercise stress or pharmacologic stress testing have not been established\u201d (previously added in October 2007 in connection with the imposition of the box warning); and including summary data from the post-approval CaRES (Contrast echocardiography Registry for Safety Surveillance) safety registry and the post-approval pulmonary hypertension study. Further, in January 2017, the FDA approved an additional modification to the DEFINITY label, removing the contraindication statement related to use in patients with a known or suspected cardiac shunt. Bracco\u2019s ultrasound contrast agent, Lumason, has substantially similar safety labeling as DEFINITY and Optison. If additional safety issues arise (not only with DEFINITY but also potentially with Optison and Lumason), this may result in unfavorable changes in labeling or result in restrictions on the approval of our product, including removal of the product from the market. Lingering safety concerns about DEFINITY among some healthcare providers or future unanticipated side effects or safety concerns associated with DEFINITY could limit expanded use of DEFINITY and have a material adverse effect on the unit sales of this product and our financial condition and results of operations.\nA heightened public or regulatory focus on the radiation risks of diagnostic imaging could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that there has been heightened public and regulatory focus on radiation exposure, including the concern that repeated doses of radiation used in diagnostic imaging procedures pose the potential risk of long-term cell damage, cancer and other diseases. For example, starting in January 2012, CMS required the accreditation of facilities providing the technical component of advanced imaging services, including CT, MRI, PET and nuclear medicine, in non-hospital freestanding settings. In August 2011, The Joint Commission (an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies more than 20,500 healthcare organizations and programs in the U.S.) issued an alert on the radiation risks of diagnostic imaging and recommended specific actions for providing \u201cthe right test and the right dose through effective processes, safe technology and a culture of safety.\u201d The Joint Commission has revised accreditation standards for diagnostic imaging in recent years, including standards related to dose optimization.\nHeightened regulatory focus on risks caused by the radiation exposure received by diagnostic imaging patients could lead to increased regulation of radiopharmaceutical manufacturers or healthcare providers who perform procedures that use our imaging agents, which could make the procedures more costly, reduce the number of providers who perform procedures and/or decrease the demand for our products. In addition, heightened public focus on or fear of radiation exposure could lead to decreased demand for our products by patients or by healthcare providers who order the procedures in which our agents are used. Although we believe that our diagnostic imaging agents when properly used do not expose patients and healthcare providers to unsafe levels of radiation, any of the foregoing risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to product liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury.\nAny product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend and could result in an increase of our insurance premiums. Although we have not had any such claims to date, claims that could be brought against us might not be covered by our insurance policies. Furthermore, although we currently have product liability insurance coverage with policy limits that we believe are customary for pharmaceutical companies in the diagnostic medical imaging industry and adequate to provide us with insurance coverage for foreseeable risks, even where the claim is covered by our insurance, our insurance coverage might be inadequate and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits. We may not be able to obtain insurance on terms acceptable to us or at all, since insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain. Our failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage or successfully defend against product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.\nOur operations use hazardous materials and produce hazardous wastes, including radioactive, chemical and, in certain circumstances, biological materials and wastes. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to the transport, use, handling, storage, exposure to and disposal of these materials and wastes. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. We are required to obtain, maintain and renew various environmental permits and nuclear licenses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for transporting, using, handling, storing and disposing of, and limiting exposure to, these materials and wastes comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury cannot be eliminated. We place a high priority on these safety procedures and seek to limit any inherent risks. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of wastes generated by our operations. Prior to disposal, we store any low level radioactive waste at our facilities to decay until the materials are no longer considered radioactive. Although we believe we have complied in all material respects with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be in compliance with all such laws at all times. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We may be required to incur further costs to comply with current or future environmental and safety laws and regulations. In addition, in the event of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nWe lease a small portion of our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility to PerkinElmer for the manufacturing, finishing and packaging of certain radioisotopes, including Strontium-90, which has physical characteristics that make it more challenging to work with and dispose of than our own commercial radioisotopes, including a much longer half-life. We are fully indemnified by PerkinElmer under our lease for any property damage or personal injury resulting from their activities in our facility. If any release or excursion of radioactive materials took place from their leased space that resulted in property damage or personal injury, the indemnification obligations were not honored, and we were forced to cover any related remediation, clean-up or other expenses, depending on the magnitude, the cost of such remediation, clean-up or other expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWhile we have budgeted for current and future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, investigation or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully introduce new products and adapt to a changing technology and medical practice landscape.\nThe healthcare industry is characterized by continuous technological development resulting in changing customer preferences and requirements. The success of new product development depends on many factors, including our ability to fund development of new agents or new indications for existing agents, anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approval on a timely basis based on performance of our agents in development versus their clinical study comparators, develop and manufacture products in a cost-effective and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from our competitors. To compete successfully in the marketplace, we must make substantial investments in new product development, whether internally or externally through licensing or acquisitions. Our failure to introduce new and innovative products in a timely manner would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEven if we are able to develop, manufacture and obtain regulatory approvals for our new products, the success of these products would depend upon market acceptance and adequate reimbursement. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe availability of alternative products from our competitors;\n\u2022\nThe breadth of indications in which alternative products from our competitors can be marketed;\n\u2022\nThe price of our products relative to those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nThe timing of our market entry;\n\u2022\nOur ability to market and distribute our products effectively;\n\u2022\nMarket acceptance of our products; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain adequate reimbursement.\nThe field of diagnostic medical imaging is dynamic, with new products, including hardware, software and agents, continually being developed and existing products continually being refined. Our own diagnostic imaging agents compete not only with other similarly administered imaging agents but also with imaging agents employed in different and often competing diagnostic modalities, and in the case of DEFINITY, echocardiography procedures without contrast. New hardware, software or agents in a given diagnostic modality may be developed that provide benefits superior to the then-dominant hardware, software and agents in that modality, resulting in commercial displacement of the agents. Similarly, changing perceptions about comparative efficacy and safety including, among other things, comparative radiation exposure, as well as changing availability of supply may favor one agent over another or one modality over another. In addition, new or revised appropriate use criteria developed by professional societies, to assist physicians and other health care providers in making appropriate imaging decisions for specific clinical conditions, can and have reduced the frequency of and demand for certain imaging modalities and imaging agents. To the extent there is technological obsolescence in any of our products that we manufacture, resulting in lower unit sales or decreased unit sales prices, we will have increased unit overhead allocable to the remaining market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe process of developing new drugs and obtaining regulatory approval is complex, time-consuming and costly, and the outcome is not certain.\nWe currently have three active clinical development programs in the U.S. - flurpiridaz F 18, LMI 1195 and DEFINITY for LVEF. To obtain regulatory approval for these agents in the indications being pursued, we must conduct extensive human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials, as well as meet other rigorous regulatory requirements, as further described in Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Regulatory Matters.\u201d Satisfaction of all regulatory requirements typically takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. A number of other factors may cause significant delays in the completion of our clinical trials, including unexpected delays in the initiation of clinical sites, slower than projected enrollment, competition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians, regulatory requirements, limits on manufacturing capacity and failure of an agent to meet required standards for administration to humans. In addition, it may take longer than we project to achieve study endpoints and complete data analysis for a trial or we may decide to slow down the enrollment in a trial in order to conserve financial resources.\nOur agents in development are also subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development and testing. The results of preliminary studies do not necessarily predict clinical success, and larger and later stage clinical trials may not produce the same results as earlier stage trials. Sometimes, agents that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials. Agents in later stage clinical trials may fail to show desired safety and efficacy traits, despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. In addition, the data collected from clinical trials of our agents in development may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval, or regulators could interpret the data differently and less favorably than we do. Further, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. Regulatory authorities may require us or our partners to conduct additional clinical testing, in which case we would have to expend additional time and resources. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in regulatory policy that occur prior to or during regulatory review. The failure to provide clinical and preclinical data that are adequate to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities that our agents in development are safe and effective for their proposed use will delay or preclude approval and will prevent us from marketing those products.\nWe are not permitted to market our agents in development in the U.S. or other countries until we have received requisite regulatory approvals. For example, securing FDA approval for a new drug requires the submission of an NDA to the FDA for our agents in development. The NDA must include extensive nonclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the agent\u2019s safety and effectiveness for each indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. The FDA review process can take many years to complete, and approval is never guaranteed. If a product is approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling, impose restricted distribution programs, require expedited reporting of certain adverse events, or require costly ongoing requirements for post-marketing clinical studies and surveillance or other risk management measures to monitor the safety or efficacy of the agent. Markets outside of the U.S. also have requirements for approval of agents with which we must comply prior to marketing. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of an agent in one country does not ensure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries. Also, any regulatory approval of any of our products or agents in development, once obtained, may be withdrawn. Approvals might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn our flurpiridaz F 18 Phase 3 program, in May 2015, we announced complete results from the 301 trial. Although flurpiridaz F 18 appeared to be well-tolerated from a safety perspective and outperformed SPECT in a highly statistically significant manner in the co-primary endpoint of sensitivity and in the secondary endpoints of image quality and diagnostic certainty, the agent did not meet its other co-primary endpoint of non-inferiority for identifying subjects without disease. In April 2017, we entered into the License Agreement with GE Healthcare for the continued Phase 3 development and worldwide commercialization of flurpiridaz F 18. Under the License Agreement, GE Healthcare will, among other things, complete the worldwide development of flurpiridaz F 18 by conducting a second Phase 3 trial and pursue worldwide regulatory approvals. We cannot assure any particular outcome from GE Healthcare\u2019s continued Phase 3 development of the agent or from regulatory review of either our or their Phase 3 study of the agent, that any of the data generated in either our or their sponsored Phase 3 study will be sufficient to support an NDA approval, that GE Healthcare will only have to conduct the one additional Phase 3 clinical study prior to filing an NDA, or that flurpiridaz F 18 will ever be approved as a PET MPI imaging agent by the FDA. Similarly, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in our clinical development program for LMI 1195 in the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors in pediatric and adult populations. For our DEFINITY for LVEF study, we did not achieve our primary or secondary endpoints in the first of two Phase 3 studies. Any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates may harm our business and delay or prevent us from being able to generate additional future revenue from product sales.\nEven if our agents in development proceed successfully through clinical trials and receive regulatory approval, there is no guarantee that an approved product can be manufactured in commercial quantities at a reasonable cost or that such a product will be successfully marketed or distributed. The burden associated with the marketing and distribution of products like ours is substantial. For example, rather than being manufactured at our own facilities, both flurpiridaz F 18 and LMI 1195 would require the creation of a complex, field-based network involving PET cyclotrons located at radiopharmacies where the agent would need to be manufactured and distributed rapidly to end-users, given the agent\u2019s 110-minute half-life. In addition, in the case of both flurpiridaz F 18 and LMI 1195, obtaining adequate reimbursement is critical, including not only coverage from Medicare, Medicaid, other government payors as well as private payors but also appropriate payment levels which adequately cover the substantially higher manufacturing and distribution costs associated with a PET agent in comparison to a Tc-99m-based agent. We can give no assurance even if either flurpiridaz F 18 or LMI 1195 obtains regulatory approval that a network of PET cyclotrons can be established or that adequate reimbursement can be secured to allow the approved agent or agents to become commercially successful.\nOur future growth may depend on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license additional products, businesses or technologies, and if we do not successfully do so, or otherwise fail to integrate any new products, lines of business or technologies into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities and it could result in significant impairment charges or other adverse financial consequences.\nWe are continuing to seek to acquire or in-license products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business strategy. Future acquisitions or in-licenses, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nA reduction of our current financial resources;\n\u2022\nIncurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nDifficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for those acquired or in-licensed technologies;\n\u2022\nHigher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\nDisruption of our business, customer base and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies; and\n\u2022\nExposure to unknown liabilities.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors likely will have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Furthermore, there may be overlap between our products or customers and the companies which we acquire that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses. Additionally, the time between our expenditures to acquire or in-license new products, technologies or businesses and the subsequent generation of revenues from those acquired products, technologies or businesses (or the timing of revenue recognition related to licensing agreements and/or strategic collaborations) could cause fluctuations in our financial performance from period to period. Finally, if we devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of those efforts, we could incur significant impairment charges or other adverse financial consequences.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products with features similar to our products, and demand for our products may decline.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection of our commercial products and technologies and agents in development as well as successfully enforcing and defending these patents and trade secrets against third parties and their challenges, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries. We will only be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that we maintain the secrecy of our trade secrets and can enforce our valid patents and trademarks.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. In addition, changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and we may not receive the same degree of protection in every jurisdiction. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third party patents.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nWe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents, and we could lose our patent rights as a result;\n\u2022\nWe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions or our patent applications may not have been timely filed, and we could lose our patent rights as a result;\n\u2022\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nIt is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in any further issued patents;\n\u2022\nOur issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable drugs, may not provide us with any protection from unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and may not provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u2022\nOur patent applications or patents may be subject to interferences, oppositions, post-grant review, ex-parte re-examinations, inter partes review or similar administrative proceedings;\n\u2022\nWhile we generally apply for patents in those countries where we intend to make, have made, use or sell patented products, we may not be able to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable and may be precluded from doing so at a later date;\n\u2022\nWe may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries where the actual cost outweighs the perceived benefit at a certain time;\n\u2022\nPatents issued in foreign jurisdictions may have different scopes of coverage than our U.S. patents and so our products may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u2022\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability. A third party may challenge the validity or enforceability of a patent even after its issuance by the USPTO or the applicable foreign patent office. It is also uncertain how much protection, if any, will be afforded by our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court or in other proceedings, which may be brought in U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdictions to challenge the validity of a patent.\nThe initiation, defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits (including Hatch-Waxman related litigation), interferences, oppositions and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly, time consuming to pursue and result in a diversion of resources, including a significant amount of management time. The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and could significantly harm our business. If we are not able to enforce and defend the patents of our technologies and products, then we will not be able to exclude competitors from marketing products that directly compete with our products, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFor DEFINITY, our fastest growing and highest margin commercial product in 2019, we continue to actively pursue patents in both the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we now have an Orange Book-listed method of use patent expiring in March 2037 and additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed expiring in 2021, 2023 and 2037. Outside of the U.S., while our DEFINITY patent protection and regulatory exclusivity have generally expired, we are currently prosecuting additional patents to try to obtain similar method of use and manufacturing patent protection as granted in the U.S. We were also recently granted a composition of matter patent on the modified formulation of DEFINITY which runs through December 2035. If the modified formulation is approved by the FDA, then this patent would be eligible to be listed in the Orange Book.\nWe will also rely on trade secrets and other know-how and proprietary information to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, but our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific partners and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors or other third parties. Enforcing a claim that a third party improperly obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and resource intensive, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. We rely on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, consultants and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees to protect our trade secrets and other know-how and proprietary information concerning our business. These confidentiality agreements may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other know-how and proprietary information, and there can be no guarantee that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, other technical know-how or proprietary information, or that we can detect such an unauthorized disclosure. We may not have adequate remedies for any unauthorized disclosure. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of that information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making those unauthorized disclosures, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks, including, among others, DEFINITY, Cardiolite, TechneLite, Neurolite, Quadramet, Luminity and Lantheus Medical Imaging. We cannot assure you that any pending trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. If our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to re-brand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the patent or other intellectual property rights of a third party. The outcome of any of these claims is uncertain and any unfavorable result could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. While we believe that the products that we currently manufacture using our proprietary technology do not infringe upon or otherwise violate proprietary rights of other parties or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, we cannot assure you that we would not be found to infringe on or otherwise violate the proprietary rights of others.\nWe may be subject to litigation over infringement claims regarding the products we manufacture or distribute. This type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, generate significant expenses, damage payments (potentially including treble damages) or restrictions or prohibitions on our use of our technology, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, if we are found to be infringing on proprietary rights of others, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license (which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all), make substantial one-time or ongoing royalty payments, or cease making, using and/or selling the infringing products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, invest in and grow our business and meet our financial obligations depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors, including the prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control, such as the rate of unemployment, the number of uninsured persons in the U.S. and inflationary pressures. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current or future economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. We are exposed to risks associated with reduced profitability and the potential financial instability of our customers, many of which may be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets. For example, unemployment and underemployment, and the resultant loss of insurance, may decrease the demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals. If fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage, our customers may experience reductions in revenues, profitability and/or cash flow that could lead them to modify, delay or cancel orders for our products. If customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us. This, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. To the extent prevailing economic conditions result in fewer procedures being performed, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived approximately 12% of our revenues from outside the fifty United States. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nLess stable political and economic environments and changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nChanges in trade policies, regulatory requirements and other barriers, including, for example, U.S. trade sanctions against Iran and those countries and entities doing business with Iran, which could adversely impact international isotope production and, indirectly, our global supply chain;\n\u2022\nPotential global disruptions in air transport due to COVID-19 (coronavirus), which could adversely affect our international supply chains for radioisotopes and our modified formulation of DEFINITY as well as international distribution channels for our commercial products;\n\u2022\nEntering into, renewing or enforcing commercial agreements with international governments or provincial authorities or entities directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such governments or authorities, such as our Belgian, Australian and South African isotope suppliers, IRE, ANSTO and NTP, and our Chinese development and commercialization partner, Double-Crane Pharmaceutical Company;\n\u2022\nInternational customers which are agencies or institutions owned or controlled by foreign governments;\n\u2022\nLocal business practices which may be in conflict with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nCurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nUnfavorable labor regulations;\n\u2022\nGreater difficulties in relying on non-U.S. courts to enforce either local or U.S. laws, particularly with respect to intellectual property;\n\u2022\nGreater potential for intellectual property piracy;\n\u2022\nGreater difficulties in managing and staffing non-U.S. operations;\n\u2022\nThe need to ensure compliance with the numerous in-country and international regulatory and legal requirements applicable to our business in each of these jurisdictions and to maintain an effective compliance program to ensure compliance with these requirements, including in connection with the recently enacted GDPR in the EU;\n\u2022\nChanges in public attitudes about the perceived safety of nuclear facilities;\n\u2022\nCivil unrest or other catastrophic events; and\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles of non-U.S. customers and difficulty collecting receivables in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThese factors are beyond our control. The realization of any of these or other risks associated with operating outside the fifty United States could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As our international exposure increases and as we execute our strategy of international expansion, these risks may intensify.\nWe face currency and other risks associated with international sales.\nWe generate revenue from export sales, as well as from operations conducted outside the fifty United States. Operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks including fluctuations in currency values, trade restrictions, tariff and trade regulations, U.S. export controls, U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws, shipping delays and economic and political instability. For example, violations of U.S. export controls, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, could result in fines, other civil or criminal penalties and the suspension or loss of export privileges which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nMany of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities, and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws outside the U.S.\nThe FCPA, the Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.\nThe FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, the provisions of the Bribery Act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and are more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties.\nOur policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of those violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information technology infrastructure, and failures of this infrastructure could harm our operations.\nTo remain competitive in our industry, we must employ information technologies to support manufacturing processes, quality processes, distribution, R&D and regulatory applications and that capture, manage and analyze large streams of data in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. We rely extensively on technology, some of which is managed by third-party service providers, to allow the concurrent conduct of work sharing around the world. As with all information technology, our equipment and infrastructure age and become subject to increasing maintenance and repair and our systems generally are vulnerable to potential damage or interruptions from fires, natural disasters, power outages, blackouts, machinery breakdown, telecommunications failures and other unexpected events, as well as to break-ins, sabotage, increasingly sophisticated intentional acts of vandalism or cybersecurity threats which, due to the nature of such attacks, may remain undetected for a period of time. As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Given the extensive reliance of our business on technology, any substantial disruption or resulting loss of data that is not avoided or corrected by our backup measures could harm our business, reputation, operations and financial condition.\nA disruption in our computer networks, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our operations or financial position.\nWe rely on our computer networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to manage and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. We may face threats to our networks from unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to external or internal attacks. Any such security breach may compromise information stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of sensitive or proprietary information. A cybersecurity breach could hurt our reputation by adversely affecting the perception of customers and potential customers of the security of their orders and personal information, as well as the perception of our manufacturing partners of the security of their proprietary information. In addition, a cybersecurity attack could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of our internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenue, regulatory actions or litigation. Any disruption of internal operations could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. To date, we have not experienced any material cybersecurity attacks.\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize, or may not be able to utilize, net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal income tax loss carryforwards of approximately $174.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2032 and will completely expire in 2037. We may be limited in our ability to use these tax loss carryforwards to reduce our future U.S. federal income tax liabilities if we were to experience another \u201cownership change\u201d as specified in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code including if we were to issue a certain amount of equity securities, certain of our stockholders were to sell shares of our common stock, or we were to enter into certain strategic transactions.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly scientific, medical and sales personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.\nCompetition in our industry for highly skilled scientific, healthcare and sales personnel is intense. Although we have not had any material difficulty in the past in hiring or retaining qualified personnel, if we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, either because of competition in our industry for these personnel or because of insufficient financial resources, then our growth may be limited and it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we lose the services of our key personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon the performance, contributions and expertise of our chief executive officer, executive leadership and senior management team. Mary Anne Heino, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and other members of our executive leadership and senior management team play a significant role in generating new business and retaining existing customers. We have an employment agreement with Ms. Heino and a limited number of other individuals on our executive leadership team, although we cannot prevent them from terminating their employment with us. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers. While we have experienced both voluntary and involuntary turnover on our executive leadership team, to date we have been able to attract new, qualified individuals to lead our company and key functional areas. Our inability to retain our existing executive leadership and senior management team, maintain an appropriate internal succession program or attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $195.0 million of total principal indebtedness remaining under our five-year secured term loan facility, which matures on June 30, 2024 (the \u201c2019 Term Facility\u201d and the loans thereunder, the \u201c2019 Term Loans\u201d) and availability of $200.0 million under our five-year revolving credit facility (the \u201c2019 Revolving Facility\u201d and, together with the 2019 Term Facility, the \u201c2019 Facility\u201d). Our substantial indebtedness and any future indebtedness we incur could:\n\u2022\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on and principal of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nMake it more difficult for us to satisfy and comply with our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, namely the payment of interest and principal;\n\u2022\nMake it more difficult to refinance the outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nSubject us to increased sensitivity to interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nMake us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry or company conditions or catastrophic external events;\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to withstand competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nReduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business, industry and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nPlace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have relatively less debt than we have.\nIn addition, our substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Our liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors not within our control.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest and principal payments, our credit ratings could be downgraded, and we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, entering into additional corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements for one or more of our products or agents in development, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, licensed or partnered, or, if sold, licensed or partnered, of the timing of the transactions and the amount of proceeds realized from those transactions, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Furthermore, our ability to refinance would depend upon the condition of the financial and credit markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may incur more debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our debt, including the 2019 Facility. Although these agreements restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. For example, we are generally permitted to incur certain indebtedness, including indebtedness arising in the ordinary course of business, indebtedness among restricted subsidiaries and us and indebtedness relating to hedging obligations. If we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt, the risks that we and they now face as a result of our leverage could intensify. In addition, 2019 Facility will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the agreements.\nOur 2019 Facility contains restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur 2019 Facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nMaintain net leverage above certain specified levels;\n\u2022\nMaintain interest coverage below certain specified levels;\n\u2022\nIncur additional debt;\n\u2022\nPay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nRedeem stock;\n\u2022\nIssue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nMake certain investments;\n\u2022\nCreate liens;\n\u2022\nEnter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nMerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the 2019 Facility. We may also be unable to take advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness.\nU.S. credit markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of future financing, including interest rate fluctuations based on macroeconomic conditions that are beyond our control.\nDuring periods of volatility and disruption in the U.S., European, or global credit markets, obtaining additional or replacement financing may be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing our 2019 Facility could be higher than under our current 2019 Facility. Higher cost of new debt may limit our ability to have cash on hand for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. Additionally, our 2019 Facility has variable interest rates. By its nature, a variable interest rate will move up or down based on changes in the economy and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. If interest rates increase, our interest expense could increase, affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOur stock price could fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of your investment to decline, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nSecurities markets worldwide have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022\nMarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nIssuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nInvestor perceptions of us and the medical technology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nSales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nAcquisitions or introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nPositive or negative results from our clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nRegulatory or political developments;\n\u2022\nLoss of intellectual property protections;\n\u2022\nLitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\nChanging economic conditions.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could also decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock and the agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Progenics Transaction\nThe Progenics Transaction may not occur, and if it does, it may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nAlthough we currently anticipate that the Progenics Transaction will occur and will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by 2022 and GAAP-reported earnings per share by 2023, these expectations are based on assumptions about our and Progenics\u2019 business and preliminary forecasts, which may change materially. Certain other expenses to be paid in connection with the Progenics Transaction may cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Progenics Transaction and could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, the Progenics Transaction may not occur or we could encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Progenics Transaction, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies and revenue growth from the combination. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Progenics Transaction and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nThe Progenics Transaction is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Progenics Transaction could have material adverse effects on our business.\nThe completion of the Progenics Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, the approval of the Merger Agreement by a majority of votes cast by the holders of the common stock of the Company and a majority of the outstanding shares of Progenics common stock, the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Progenics Transaction or the issuance of the shares of our common stock as deal consideration, the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the issuance of shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Progenics, the absence of a material adverse effect on us or Progenics, and other conditions customary for a transaction of this type, which make the completion of the Progenics Transaction and timing thereof uncertain. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Progenics, including, among other things (i) if the Progenics Transaction is not consummated on or before the \u201coutside date\u201d of July 1, 2020, (ii) if the required approval of our stockholders or the Progenics stockholders is not obtained, (iii) if the other party willfully breaches its non-solicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement, (v) if the other party materially breaches its representations, warranties or covenants and fails to cure such breach, (vi) if any law or order prohibiting the Progenics Transaction or the issuance of the shares of our common stock forming part of the merger consideration has become final and non-appealable, or (vii) if the board of directors of the other party fails to include such party\u2019s recommendation in favor of the Progenics Transaction in the joint proxy statement/prospectus or changes its recommendation in connection with the Progenics Transaction. If the Progenics Transaction is not completed, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits that we could have realized had the Progenics Transaction been completed, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock could decline;\n\u2022\nWe could owe substantial termination fees to Progenics under certain circumstances;\n\u2022\nTime and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Progenics Transaction could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n\u2022\nWe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers or employees; and\n\u2022\nWe will be required to pay our costs relating to the Progenics Transaction, such as legal, accounting, certain financial advisory, consulting and printing fees, whether or not the Progenics Transaction is completed.\nUpon termination of the Merger Agreement, we will be required to pay to Progenics a termination fee of $18.34 million if: (i) we willfully breach our nonsolicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement; (ii) our Board changes its recommendation in support of the merger as a result of a superior proposal or intervening event; or (iii) our stockholders do not approve the issuance of common stock in connection with the merger (if at such time Progenics has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement because we willfully breached our nonsolicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement or our board changed its recommendation in support of the merger as a result of a superior proposal or intervening event). In addition, we will be required to pay to Progenics the termination fee if we receive an acquisition proposal, the Merger Agreement is later terminated under certain circumstances and within twelve months after termination we enter into an agreement with respect to (or consummate) an acquisition proposal for 50% or more of our stock or assets.\nIn addition, if the Progenics Transaction is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Progenics Transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. If any such risk materializes, it could adversely impact our ongoing business. Similarly, delays in the completion of the Progenics Transaction could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Progenics Transaction and cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Progenics Transaction is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. We cannot assure you that the conditions to the closing of the Progenics Transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the Progenics Transaction will be consummated.\nWe and Progenics are each subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Progenics Transaction is pending, which could adversely affect the business and operations of us or the combined company.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Progenics Transaction, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we or Progenics has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Progenics, as the case may be, as a result of the Progenics Transaction, which could negatively affect our current or the combined company\u2019s future revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Progenics Transaction is completed. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we and Progenics are each subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completing the Progenics Transaction, which could adversely affect each party\u2019s ability to execute certain of its business strategies. Such limitations could adversely affect each party\u2019s business and operations prior to the completion of the Progenics Transaction. Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Progenics Transaction.\nUncertainties associated with the Progenics Transaction may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, and we and Progenics may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nWe and Progenics are each dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our respective management personnel and other key employees to execute our business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the completion of the Progenics Transaction will depend in part upon the ability of each of us and Progenics to attract, motivate and retain key management personnel and other key employees. Prior to completion of the Progenics Transaction, current and prospective employees of each of us and Progenics may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the Progenics Transaction, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of us and Progenics to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. In addition, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees of each of us and Progenics to the same extent that we and Progenics have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees.\nThe Progenics Transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or the combined company or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Progenics Transaction.\nBefore the Progenics Transaction may be completed, any approvals, consents or clearances required in connection with the Progenics Transaction must have been obtained, in each case, under applicable law. Consummation of the Progenics Transaction is conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the Progenics Transaction under the HSR Act, which has been obtained by grant of early termination of the HSR Act waiting period on October 25, 2019. Notwithstanding the grant of early termination, at any time before or after the Progenics Transaction is consummated, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws in opposition to the Progenics Transaction, including seeking to enjoin completion of the Progenics Transaction, condition completion of the Progenics Transaction upon the divestiture of assets, or impose restrictions on post-merger operations. Any such requirements or restrictions may prevent or delay completion of the Progenics Transaction or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the Progenics Transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a \u201cno solicitation\u201d covenant that restricts our ability to solicit, initiate, seek or support, or knowingly encourage or facilitate, any inquiries or proposals with respect to certain acquisition proposal relating to the Company; engage or participate in negotiations with respect to any acquisition proposal; provide a third party confidential information with respect to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any acquisition proposals; or enter into any acquisition agreement with respect to certain unsolicited proposals relating to an acquisition proposal. In the event we receive an unsolicited acquisition proposal, we must promptly communicate the receipt of such proposal and provide copies of material communications and information, including the terms and conditions of such proposal, to the other party. If, in response to such proposals and subject to certain conditions, we intend to effect a change in our board of directors\u2019 recommendation to stockholders, we must provide Progenics an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Merger Agreement in response to such competing acquisition proposal before our board may withdraw or qualify its respective recommendation. The Merger Agreement further provides that in the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, including a termination by Progenics following a change in recommendation by our board or a willful and material breach of the no-solicitation provision applicable to us, we may be required to pay Progenics a termination fee equal to $18,340,000.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of the Company from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or total value than the total value proposed to be paid in the merger. These provisions might also result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price in an acquisition proposal than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee and other fees and expenses that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nCurrent stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the Company after the Progenics Transaction and will exercise less influence over the management of the combined company.\nUpon completion of the Progenics Transaction, we expect to issue approximately 26.9 million shares of our common stock to Progenics stockholders. As a result, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the Progenics Transaction, former Progenics stockholders will own approximately 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, shares of our common stock may be issued from time to time following the Progenics Transaction to holders of Progenics equity awards on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. Consequently, our current stockholders in the aggregate will have less influence over the management and policies of the Company than they currently have.\nWe and Progenics may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Progenics Transaction from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. As of the date of filing of this report, six securities class action lawsuits have been filed against Progenics and its board of directors alleging inadequate disclosure by Progenics under the Registration Statement on Form S-4 related to the Progenics Transaction (which registration statement will be revised to describe, among other things, the revised terms in the Amended Merger Agreement). Two of those lawsuits against Progenics also name us or one of our affiliates as defendants, although we do not believe that those lawsuits have merit or will result in any material monetary damages payable by us. Even if lawsuits are without merit, defending against any legal claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment in a securities class action lawsuit or derivative lawsuit alleging significant monetary loss by the plaintiffs could result in monetary damages for us and Progenics, which could have a negative impact on our and Progenics\u2019 respective liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Progenics Transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Progenics Transaction from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operation.\nCompletion of the Progenics Transaction may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Progenics or its subsidiaries are a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the Progenics Transaction may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which Progenics or its subsidiaries are a party. If we and Progenics are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we and Progenics are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Progenics or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nProgenics stockholders have appraisal rights under Delaware law.\nUnder Delaware law, Progenics stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the Amended Merger Agreement and who otherwise properly perfect their rights will be entitled to \u201cappraisal rights\u201d in connection with the Progenics Transaction, which generally entitle stockholders to receive, in lieu of the merger consideration, a cash payment of an amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be equal to the fair value of their Progenics common stock as of the effective time of the merger. The appraised value would be determined by the Court of Chancery and could be less than, the same as, or more than the merger consideration. Under Delaware law, stockholders are generally entitled to statutory interest on an appraisal award at a rate equal to 5% above the Federal Reserve discount rate compounded quarterly from the closing date of the merger until the award is actually paid. Stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal rights must file a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery within 120 days after the effective date of the merger. Should a material number of Progenics stockholders exercise appraisal rights and should the Court determine that the fair value of such shares of Progenics common stock is materially greater than the merger consideration, we will be required to pay significantly more than anticipated in connection with the Progenics Transaction, which could adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of the combined company.\nThe combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the Progenics business into our business and realize the anticipated benefits of the Progenics Transaction.\nThe success of the Progenics Transaction will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability to successfully combine the business of Progenics with our business, which currently operate as independent public companies, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies and revenue growth from the combination. If the combined company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of its common stock may be harmed. Additionally, as a result of the Progenics Transaction, rating agencies may take negative actions against the combined company's credit ratings, which may increase the combined company\u2019s financing costs.\nThe Progenics Transaction involves the integration of Progenics\u2019 business into our existing business, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. We and Progenics have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the Progenics Transaction. The integration may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nThe diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management\u2019s attention to the Progenics Transaction;\n\u2022\nManaging a larger combined company;\n\u2022\nMaintaining employee morale and attracting, motivating and retaining management personnel and other key employees;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated risks to our integration plan including in connection with timing, talent, and the potential need for additional resources;\n\u2022\nNew or previously unidentified manufacturing, regulatory, or research and development issues in the Progenics business;\n\u2022\nRetaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n\u2022\nIntegrating corporate and administrative infrastructures in geographically separate organizations and eliminating duplicative expenses;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nUnforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Progenics Transaction.\nMany of these factors will be outside of the combined company\u2019s control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect the combined company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We and Progenics have operated, and until completion of the Progenics Transaction will continue to operate, independently. We and Progenics are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the Progenics Transaction and have not yet determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies will be combined after the combination. The actual integration of Progenics with our business may result in additional or unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on (i) each of us and Progenics during this transition period and (ii) the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the Progenics Transaction. In addition, any actual cost savings of the Progenics Transaction could be less than anticipated.\nThe future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the Progenics Transaction.\nFollowing the completion of the Progenics Transaction, the size of the combined company\u2019s business will be significantly larger than the current size of our business. The combined company\u2019s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management\u2019s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two independent stand-alone companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. The combined company may not be successful or may not realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the Progenics Transaction.\nThe CVRs we will issue as part of the Progenics Transaction may result in substantial future payments and could divert the attention of our management.\nAs part of the consideration for the Progenics Transaction, we will issue CVRs to the stockholders of Progenics and holders of in-the-money Progenics equity awards entitling them to future cash payments of 40% of PyL net sales over $100 million in 2022 and over $150 million in 2023. These payments could be substantial and could adversely impact our liquidity. In addition, we are obligated to exercise a level of effort, expertise and resources consistent with those normally used in a medical diagnostics business similar to our size and resources with respect to developing, seeking regulatory approval for and commercializing a product of similar market potential at a similar stage in its development or product life to PyL. We are also required to produce net sales statements for PyL that may be reviewed and challenged by CVR holders, with any disagreement to be resolved by an independent accountant. These requirements could divert management time and resources and result in additional costs.\nThe financial analyses and forecasts considered by Lantheus Holdings and Progenics and their respective financial advisors may not be realized, which may adversely affect the market price of Lantheus Holdings common stock following the completion of the merger.\nIn performing their financial analyses and rendering their opinions related to the merger, each of the respective financial advisors to Lantheus Holdings and Progenics relied on, among other things, internal stand-alone financial analyses and forecasts as separately provided by Lantheus Holdings and Progenics. These analyses and forecasts were prepared by, or as directed by, the management of Lantheus Holdings or the management of Progenics, as applicable. None of these analyses or forecasts were prepared with a view towards public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These projections are inherently based on various estimates and assumptions that are subject to the judgment of those preparing them. These projections are also subject to significant economic, competitive, industry and other uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Lantheus Holdings and Progenics. There can be no assurance that Lantheus Holdings\u2019 or Progenics\u2019 financial condition or results of operations will be consistent with those set forth in such analyses and forecasts, which could have an adverse impact on the market price of Lantheus Holdings common stock or the financial position of the combined company following the merger.\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Progenics Transaction and the integration of the Progenics business with our business.\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the Progenics Transaction, including seeking approval from our stockholders, and the integration of the Progenics business with our business. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue management, marketing and benefits. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses related to the Progenics Transaction, facilities and systems consolidation costs. The combined company may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to attract, motivate or retain management personnel or key employees. We will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business, and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs. Additionally, as a result of the Progenics Transaction, rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to the combined company\u2019s credit ratings, which may increase the combined company\u2019s financing costs. These incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.", "PERMNO": 15429, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "LNTH"}
