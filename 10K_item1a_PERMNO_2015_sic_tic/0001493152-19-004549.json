Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described below. You should consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Report, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, our business prospects, and financial condition, and the value of an investment in our business. There may be other factors that are not mentioned here or of which we are not presently aware that could also affect our business operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe may experience delays in conducting the additional validation studies necessary for the commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122, or we may encounter unanticipated results or findings.\nWe have successfully completed our R&D Validation study and are now conducting Analytic Validation. If we successfully complete Analytic Validation, our next step prior to commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122 will be to conduct a CLIA Laboratory Validation study and a Clinical Validation study thereafter. Clinical Validation is the final step prior to commercial launch of a LDT, and we are targeting completion of a Clinical Validation study during the second half of 2019. If these studies are completed successfully, we plan to commercialize or to arrange for the commercialization of the test as a LDT to be run solely in our clinical laboratory in Alameda, CA. Until we perform these studies, we will not know whether we can successfully complete the development of DetermaVu\u2122. We have limited experience conducting clinical validation and have not yet performed a clinical utility demonstration in our lab. We may not be able to successfully complete this testing for DetermaVu\u2122 or any other test we may develop. While we plan to make DetermaVuTM commercially available in the second half of 2019, there can be no assurance that there will be no delays in the successful completion of the Clinical Validation study and commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122, due to any number factors some of which may not be within our control. Any delays in the successful completion of the additional validation studies for DetermaVu\u2122 could cause us to incur significant additional costs and delay the completion of development and commercial launch of DetermaVu\u2122. We may encounter unanticipated results or finding in the studies subsequent to our R&D Validation study showing that our R&D Validation study results may not be predictive of future test results with DetermaVu\u2122 or any other future candidate tests. We have performed only limited R&D work for any other test or for any other intended patient population outside of lung cancer, and we have conducted no R&D work outside of cancer. Our Immune System Interrogation approach, which analyzes the immune systems response to a specific disease, and our technology may not ultimately have application in any other population, and we may be unable to identify any future candidates and tests for any other cancer or any other disease population.\nWe do not currently have any diagnostic tests on the market and have not yet generated any revenues from operations.\nWe plan to complete development of DetermaVuTM and make it commercially available in the second half 2019. However, we may be unable to complete development in that timeframe or at all. Even if we complete development of DetermaVu\u2122, our commercialization arrangements may not generate revenues in sufficient amounts to meet our operating expenses. Without diagnostic test sales or licensing fee revenues, we will not be able to operate at a profit, and we will not be able to cover our operating expenses without raising additional capital.\nWe have limited capital, marketing, and sales resources and no distribution resources for the commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122.\nIf we are successful in completing the remaining steps of CLIA Laboratory Validation and Clinical Validation for DetermaVu\u2122, we will need to build our own marketing and sales capability, which will require the investment of significant financial and management resources to recruit, train, and manage a sales force and build-out a health care regulatory compliance program. In the alternative, due to our limited capital resources, we may need to enter into marketing arrangements with other diagnostic companies for DetermaVu\u2122. Under such marketing arrangements we may license marketing rights to one or more other companies or to one or more joint venture companies formed to market DetermaVu\u2122, and we might receive only a royalty on sales of DetermaVu\u2122 or an equity interest in a joint venture company. As a result, our revenues from the sale of DetermaVu\u2122 may be substantially less than the amount of revenues and gross profits that we might receive if we were to market DetermaVu\u2122 ourselves.\nSales of DetermaVuTM or any other diagnostic tests that we may develop could be adversely impacted by the reluctance of physicians to adopt the use of our tests and by the availability of competing diagnostic tests.\nPhysicians and hospitals may be reluctant to try a new diagnostic test due to the high degree of risk associated with the application of new technologies and diagnostic test in the field of human medicine, especially if the new test differs from the current standard of care for detecting cancer in patients. Competing tests for the initial diagnosis, reoccurrence diagnosis and optimal treatment of cancer are being manufactured and marketed by established companies and by other smaller biotechnology companies. In order to compete with other diagnostic tests, particularly any that sell at lower prices, our diagnostic tests will have to provide medically significant advantages or be more cost effective. Even if we are able to overcome physician reluctance and compete with products that are currently on the market, our competitors may succeed in developing new safer, more accurate or more cost-effective diagnostic tests that could render our diagnostic tests and technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nIf our laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, or we are required to vacate any facility, our ability to provide services and pursue our research and development and commercialization efforts may be jeopardized.\nWe do not have any clinical laboratory facilities outside of our facility in Alameda, California. Our facility and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests or provide laboratory services for some period of time. The inability to perform our tests or the backlog of tests that could develop if any of our facilities is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation or relationships with key researchers, collaborators, and customers, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace.\nAdditionally, a key component of our research and development process involves using biological samples and the resulting data sets and medical histories, as the basis for our diagnostic test development. In some cases, these samples are difficult to obtain. If the parts of our laboratory facilities where we store these biological samples are damaged or compromised, our ability to pursue our research and development projects, commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122, as well as our reputation, could be jeopardized. We carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFurther, if our laboratory becomes inoperable we may not be able to license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third-party, with established state licensure and CLIA certification under the scope of which our diagnostic tests could be performed following validation and other required procedures, to perform the tests. Even if we find a third-party with such qualifications to perform our tests, such party may not be willing to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms. Moreover, we believe our test is currently subject to enforcement discretion by the FDA because we believe the test currently qualifies as an LDT. If, however, we are required to find a third-party laboratory to conduct our testing services, we believe this would change our status and the FDA would consider such test offered through a third-party to then be a medical device subject to active FDA regulation and enforcement. In that case, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance or approval prior to offering our tests, which would be time-consuming and costly and could result in delays in our ability to sell or offer our tests.\nWe may not be able to produce additional cancer diagnostic tests that offer high enough sensitivity to offset the availability of minimally invasive biopsies for some types of cancer, which could impede our development and commercialization of an array of diagnostic tests beyond DetermaVu\u2122 for lung cancer.\nWe believe that a significant benefit of DetermaVu\u2122 will be the reduction of unnecessary surgical biopsies to diagnose lung cancer. While lung cancer biopsies involve an invasive surgical procedure, biopsies of some other types of cancer, including breast cancer, often can be performed using less invasive procedures that result in significantly less risk, discomfort, and cost to the patient while providing a diagnostic result that would be as accurate or more accurate than any diagnostic tests we may develop. As a result, physicians and patients may prefer to rely on a non-invasive or minimally invasive biopsy to test for certain cancers rather than use a blood test.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception, and we do not know if we will attain profitability.\nSince our inception in September 2009, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows in the future. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $15.8 million and $19.4 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $71.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Since inception, we have financed our operations through sales of our common stock and warrants, loans from BioTime and BioTime affiliates, warrant exercises, a bank loan and sale of BioTime common shares that we hold as marketable equity securities. Although BioTime may continue to provide administrative support to us on a reimbursable basis, we do not expect BioTime to provide future financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing that we may need, or that any such financing that may become available will be on terms that are favorable to us and our shareholders. Ultimately, our ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to earn a profit depends upon our success in developing and marketing or licensing our diagnostic tests and technology.\nThe research and development work we are doing is costly, time consuming, and uncertain as to its results.\nWe incurred research and development expenses amounting to approximately $6.5 million and $7.2 million during years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We are presently devoting substantially all of our efforts to the development of DetermaVu\u2122 for the detection of lung cancer but we may expand the focus of our research and development to address additional types of cancer. If we are successful in developing a new technology or diagnostic test for additional types of cancer, refinement of the new technology or diagnostic test and definition of the practical applications and limitations of the technology or diagnostic test may take years and require the expenditure of large sums of money. There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing diagnostic tests for additional types of cancer regardless of the amount of our expenditures, even if we are able to successfully complete the development of DetermaVu\u2122.\nIt is likely that we will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses until such time as our revenues are sufficient to finance our operating expenses.\n\u25cf We plan to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses and we anticipate that we will be incurring significant sales and marketing costs as we develop and commercialize DetermaVu\u2122. Our research and development expenses may also increase if we work to develop liquid biopsy tests for additional types of cancer. The period of time for which our current cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to finance our operations will depend on the extent to which we expend funds on commercializing DetermaVu\u2122 and conducting new research and development programs. We will need to raise additional capital to pay operating expenses unless we are able to generate sufficient revenues from diagnostic test sales, royalties, and license fees to meet our operating expenses.\n\u25cf Our ability to raise additional equity or debt capital will depend not only on the successful completion of development of DetermaVu\u2122 and receiving reimbursement approval from Medicare and other third-party payers, but also will depend on access to capital and conditions in the capital markets. Obtaining Medicare reimbursement approval for a diagnostic test generally takes two to three years, and investors may be reluctant to provide us with additional capital until we obtain Medicare reimbursement approval for DetermaVu\u2122. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise capital at times and in amounts needed to finance the development and commercialization of DetermaVu\u2122 and general operations. Even if capital is available, it may not be available on terms that we or our shareholders would consider favorable.\n\u25cf Sales or other issuances of additional equity securities by us could result in the dilution of the interests of our shareholders.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nOur business will depend on certain biomarkers that have been licensed from Wistar for our lung cancer diagnostic test. The license agreement imposes obligations on us, including payment obligations and obligations to pursue development and commercialization of diagnostic tests under the licensed patents and technology. If Wistar believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, Wistar could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential diagnostic tests, and our ability to raise any capital that we might then need, could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, we would not be able to continue to use the licensed biomarkers in our business.\nThere is a limited number of manufacturers of molecular diagnostic testing equipment and related chemical reagents necessary for the provision of our diagnostic tests.\nAfter encountering inconsistent results using diagnostic testing equipment and reagents from one manufacturer, we switched to diagnostic testing equipment from a different manufacturer. The chemical reagents used with the diagnostic testing equipment are available only from the equipment manufacturer. If issues were to arise with the new equipment or reagents we are using causing us to acquire different diagnostic testing equipment again, we would need to conduct additional R&D Validation and analytic studies to determine whether our previous test results can be reproduced using the new equipment. As a result, we could experience delays again in developing our diagnostic tests. If similar issues were to arise after commercialization of a diagnostic test, we could experience a disruption for a period of time in providing the diagnostic tests to patients and we would lose revenues and potentially market share as a result.\nIf we fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic alliances for diagnostic tests that we elect to co-develop, co-market, or out-license, we may have to reduce or delay our diagnostic test development or increase our expenditures.\nIn order to facilitate the development, manufacture and commercialization of our diagnostic tests we may enter into strategic alliances with diagnostic, pharmaceutical, or medical device companies to advance our programs and enable us to maintain our financial and operational capacity. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances. We may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. If we fail to create and maintain suitable alliances, we may have to limit the size or scope of, or delay, one or more of our product development or research programs, or we will have to increase our expenditures and will need to obtain additional funding, which may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms.\nIf we are able to enter into development and marketing arrangements with diagnostic, pharmaceutical or medical device companies for our diagnostic tests, we may license product development, manufacturing, and marketing rights to the pharmaceutical or medical device company or to a joint venture company formed with the pharmaceutical or medical device company. Under such arrangements we might receive only a royalty on sales of the diagnostic tests developed or an equity interest in a joint venture company that develops the diagnostic test. As a result, our revenues from the sale of those diagnostic tests may be substantially less than the amount of revenues and gross profits that we might receive if we were to develop, manufacture, and market the diagnostic tests ourselves.\nWe may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our diagnostic test candidates and to provide the manufacturing, regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business.\nWe may enter into various kinds of collaborative research and development, manufacturing, and diagnostic test marketing agreements to develop and commercialize our diagnostic tests. Any future milestone payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our diagnostic tests, but there are risks associated with entering into collaboration arrangements.\nThere is a risk that we could become dependent upon one or more collaborative arrangements for diagnostic test development or manufacturing or as a source of revenues from the sale of any diagnostic tests that may be developed by us alone or through one of the collaborative arrangements. A collaborative arrangement upon which we might depend might be terminated by our collaboration partner or they might determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of our diagnostic tests. A collaboration partner also may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing diagnostic tests or technologies.\nThere is a risk that a collaboration partner might fail to perform its obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing its obligations. In addition, a collaboration partner may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent it from having available funds to contribute to the collaboration. If a collaboration partner fails to conduct its diagnostic test development, manufacturing, commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if it terminates or materially modifies its agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more diagnostic test candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue diagnostic test development, manufacturing, and commercialization on our own.\nFailure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, could harm our business.\nWe cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking are sufficient to protect our trademark rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over trademark rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Challenges to our trademarks could result in significant costs related to the prosecution or defense of the registrations of our trademarks or rebranding if we need to abandon or modify a trademark.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend.\nWe presently rely on a small senior management team to direct our diagnostics program and our initial commercial activities. Accordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of the members of that management team could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under a bank loan agreement.\nWe have entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank for a loan that is secured by substantially all of our assets, other than our patents and trade secrets, as collateral for the loan. If a default were to arise under the Loan and Security Agreement, the bank could foreclose on its security interest and we could lose our collateral, which could force us to discontinue our operations.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data for our diagnostic test candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our diagnostic test candidates could be delayed.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, and could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our business partners, and personally identifiable information of patients and employees. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, theft, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings or liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation. Even if we do not incur an interruption of or our operations, fines, penalties, or financial liability to third parties from a security breach, we could suffer a loss of confidence in our services, which could adversely affect our business and competitive position.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Our growth and entry into new diagnostic tests, technologies and markets will place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Because we are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting issuer, we are exempt from the requirement of having our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accountants, which means that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls that might be detected by an audit may not be detected and remedied.\nWe are presently relying in part on financial systems maintained by BioTime and upon services provided by BioTime personnel. BioTime allocates certain expenses among itself, us, and BioTime\u2019s other subsidiaries, which creates a risk that the allocations may not accurately reflect the benefit of an expenditure or use of financial or other resources by us, BioTime as our parent company, and the BioTime subsidiaries among which the allocations are made.\nWe may record an impairment of assets and take a charge to earnings for financial reporting purposes in the future if we discontinue the use of our original diagnostic testing platform in our CLIA lab.\nAlthough we have changed diagnostic testing platforms for research and development purposes, we are continuing to use our original platform for clinical testing in our CLIA laboratory for certification purposes. If we discontinue that use of the original diagnostic testing platform, that equipment could be considered an impaired asset for financial reporting purposes and we would write down the value of that equipment on our condensed balance sheet and take a charge to earnings for the impaired value. We acquired the equipment through a lease, and we would remain obligated to continue to make payments under the lease even if we discontinue use of the equipment.\nWe may from time to time be involved in or subject to legal proceedings, and unfavorable outcomes of such legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may from time to time be involved in, subject to, or threatened with legal proceedings related to, or incidental to the conduct of, our business. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. For example, after the public announcement of our most recent public offering of shares of common stock, we received a letter from Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, or Chardan, claiming entitlement to certain fees pursuant to an engagement letter unrelated to the offering. We believe Chardan\u2019s claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against any claims that may be brought by Chardan. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter, or its effect on us or our financial position. The assessment of the outcome of any legal proceeding, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. In addition, defense and settlement costs for any legal proceeding can be substantial, even with respect to claims that have no merit.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur testing of DetermaVu\u2122 is conducted in a single, CLIA-certified laboratory. Our operations as a clinical laboratory are subject to oversight by CMS under CLIA, as well as certain state agencies, and any failure to maintain our CLIA or applicable state permits and licenses may affect our ability to commercialize DetermaVuTM.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Our clinical laboratory must be certified under CLIA in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. We have a current certificate under CLIA to perform routine chemistry. To renew this certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make periodic inspections of our clinical laboratory outside of the renewal process.\nThe law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state. Our laboratory is located in California and must maintain a California state license. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, several other states require that we hold licenses to test specimens from patients in those states. For example, Maryland is just one of several states that require out-of-state laboratories to have a state laboratory license to perform diagnostic tests on samples originating from Maryland residents. Other states may have similar requirements or may adopt similar requirements in the future. Additionally, New York is exempt from CLIA and has their own stricter clinical laboratory regulatory programs. We could be required to comply with their program in the event we accept specimens from New York. We do not have immediate plans to market our tests for commercial use in the European Union and as a result, at this time we do not believe we are subject to EU or EU member state post-market regulations related to our tests.\nIf we were to lose our CLIA certification or California laboratory license, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to offer our tests, which would limit our revenue and harm our business. If we were to lose our license in other states where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those states. If we perform testing on samples originating in a state where we require a license, but do not currently have one, we could be subject to fines, sanctions, and may be denied permits or licenses in the future.\nIf the FDA takes the position that DetermaVu\u2122 is not within the scope of its policy on enforcement discretion for laboratory-developed tests, or otherwise determines that it will seek to actively regulate DetermaVu\u2122, responding to such a regulatory position could lead to delays in commercialization, or (if encountered after commercialization) requirements to halt the commercial provision of our test until FDA marketing authorization is obtained, or enforcement action from the FDA.\nAlthough we believe we are within the scope of the FDA\u2019s policy on enforcement discretion for laboratory-developed tests, the initial commercialization and continued commercial availability of an LDT is subject to uncertainty given the FDA\u2019s latitude in interpreting and applying its laws and policies. For example, although the FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion over most LDTs, it does not consider tests to be subject to this enforcement discretion if they were or are designed or manufactured completely, or partly, outside of the laboratory that offers and uses them, or if they are offered \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (as opposed to being available to patients only when prescribed by a health care provider). Even for tests that appear to fall within FDA\u2019s previously stated policy on enforcement discretion, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time.\nIn December 2018 the FDA Commissioner and the Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) expressed significant concerns regarding disparities between some LDTs and in vitro diagnostics that have been reviewed and cleared or approved by FDA. If the FDA were to determine that our tests are not within the policy for LDTs for any reason, including new rules, policies, or guidance, or due to new legislation such as the proposed VALID Act, our tests may become subject to FDA requirements, including pre-market review. If required, the regulatory marketing authorization process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a pre-market clearance (510(k)) submission or filing a de novo or pre-market approval application with the FDA. If pre-market review and approval is required by the FDA, we may need to incur additional expenses or require additional time to seek it, or we may be unable to satisfy FDA standards, and our tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, and the labeling claims permitted by the FDA may not be consistent with our currently planned claims or adequate to support adoption of and reimbursement for our tests. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to inspection by and the regulatory requirements of the FDA, for example registration and listing, adherence to good manufacturing practices under the Quality System Regulation, and medical device reporting, and enforcement action in the event we fail to comply with these requirements. Our laboratory is operating under CLIA and is not currently operating as a device manufacturing facility following FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation. Because these standards differ, we may face challenges establishing FDA-compliant quality systems or be unable to do so. If after commercialization under the LDT framework our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the regulatory status of our tests, including questions that may be raised if competitors object to our regulatory positioning as an LDT, we may encounter ongoing regulatory and legal challenges and related costs. Such challenges or related developments (for example if the labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are more limited than the claims we currently plan to make) may impact our commercialization efforts as orders or reimbursement may be less than anticipated. Any of these regulatory developments may cause our business to suffer.\nWe will also need to obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals for any IVDs that we may develop, in order to market those IVD tests.\nIf we decide to develop IVDs, we will need to obtain regulatory approval to market each new IVD test. This means that:\n\u25cf The IVDs that we may develop cannot be sold until the CMS or the FDA, and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities approve the laboratory tests or the IVDs for medical use.\n\u25cf We will have to conduct expensive and time-consuming clinical trials of new diagnostic tests. The full cost of conducting and completing clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval of IVD tests or for gaining reimbursement from health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, Medicare, and other third-party payers cannot be presently determined but could exceed our financial resources.\n\u25cf Data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory agency approvals. Delays or denials of the regulatory approvals may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory agency policy, regulations, or laws.\n\u25cf A diagnostic test that is approved may be subject to restrictions on use.\n\u25cf The FDA can withdraw approval of an FDA regulated product if problems arise.\nClinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future diagnostic tests.\nClinical trial failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf Delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u25cf Delays in obtaining Institutional Review Board and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf Slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u25cf Limited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third-party payers for the use of our diagnostic test candidates in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf Negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u25cf Approval and introduction of new diagnostic or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u25cf Inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u25cf Inability to replicate in large controlled studies safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials; and\n\u25cf Inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIf the FDA regulates LDTs such as the ones we are developing, we may be subject to a medical device manufacturer\u2019s tax.\nThe Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) requires that medical device manufacturers pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain devices. The medical device excise tax moratorium expired on December 31, 2017, but Congress extended the moratorium for an additional two years and as a result the medical device excise tax will not apply to the sale of taxable medical devices by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the device during the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2019. The extension of the moratorium was retroactive to January 1, 2018. None of our LDTs are anticipated to be listed with the FDA and therefore to be subject to this tax, however, if in the future our tests were to be regulated by the FDA, we could become subject to the excise tax.\nIn 2019, when certain provisions of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) are scheduled to take effect, the demand and payment for our services may be impacted.\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d), which was signed into law on April 16, 2015, makes substantial changes to the payment structure for physicians. This legislation, beginning in 2019, encourages physicians to enroll in alternative payment methods which incentivize physicians differently than how they are currently. We do not currently know how or if this will impact the future demand or payments for our services.\nThe commercial success of DetermaVuTM depends on the availability and sufficiency of third-party payer coverage and reimbursement, which may be limited or unavailable.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize DetermaVuTM will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels can be obtained for patients. Physicians will be hesitant to order a diagnostic test for a patient when they may be left with a large out-of-pocket fee through co-payments or co-insurance or unreimbursed balances. Third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, are increasingly challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and services. In addition, legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs may result in lower prices or the actual inability of prospective customers to purchase DetermaVuTM. Furthermore, even if reimbursement is available, it may not be available at price levels sufficient for us to realize a positive return on our investment. We have never successfully obtained reimbursement for any test and may never be able to obtain reimbursement from any third-party payer; without such coverage and reimbursement, we may not achieve market acceptance of our test and may never be profitable.\nThe United States government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit DetermaVuTM from coverage. Even if DetermaVuTM receives coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, such coverage policies and reimbursement rates may change at any time, might not be adequate, or less favorable coverage polices and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for DetermaVuTM, its commercial success may be greatly hindered and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may need to conduct additional studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of DetermaVuTM to the satisfaction of our target customers and their third-party payers. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources\nChanges in healthcare laws and policies may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ACA substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and Congressional leaders and the President have voiced their intent to amend the ACA or to repeal and replace it with new legislation, the provisions of which are not yet known. Among the ACA\u2019s key changes, the ACA reduced payment rates under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and established an Independent Payment Advisory Board to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if spending exceeds a target growth rate. If retained, such provisions may negatively impact payment rates for our diagnostic tests. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2013, the ACA included a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices sold outside of the retail setting. Although a moratorium has been imposed on this excise tax for 2016 through 2019, the excise tax is scheduled to be restored in 2020.\nPAMA significantly altered the payment methodology under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule that determines Medicare coverage for laboratory tests. Under PAMA, clinical laboratories are required to report test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic laboratory test and beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic laboratory test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period.\nCongress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance payment requirement on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, which would require us to bill patients for these amounts. In the event that Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for our tests could often exceed the amount actually received from the patient.\nMedicare payments for new ADLTs are now based on the list price or charge. After the test is commercially available for three quarters, the laboratory will be required to report payment and volume information and that data will be used to set payment for the test for the following year.\n\u25cf If data shows that the list price was greater than 130% of the payment using established methodology (a weighted median), CMS will recoup the difference from the laboratory through a payment claw back.\n\u25cf Payment will be updated annually based on the weighted median of commercial payer reimbursement.\nOn January 1, 2018 the new PAMA-based Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule went into effect for the first time. PAMA-based prices did not impact all lab tests equally. Some tests had price reductions while others saw price increases.\nWe cannot predict whether future health care initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. The expansion of government\u2019s role in the U.S. health care industry as a result of the ACA or the repeal or amendment of the ACA, and changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by Medicare and other payers for diagnostic tests may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause of certain Medicare billing policies, we may not receive complete reimbursement for tests provided to Medicare patients.\nMedicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test or assay is approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither the supplier nor any other party, such as a diagnostic laboratory, may receive reimbursement from Medicare for the service. Regional policies are directed by Medicare\u2019s regional MACs. Reimbursement for our diagnostic testing may be negatively impacted by California MAC policies.\nLong payment cycles of Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers, or other payment delays, could hurt our cash flows and increase our need for working capital.\nMedicare and Medicaid have complex billing and documentation requirements that we will have to satisfy in order to receive payment. Failure to comply with these requirements and other laws applicable to billing may result in, among other things, non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. Similarly, the failure of private health insurers or other private third-party payers to properly process our payment claims in a timely manner could delay our receipt of payment for our diagnostic tests and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nPrivate health insurance company policies may deny coverage or limit the amount they will reimburse us for the performance of our diagnostic tests.\nPatients who are not covered by Medicare will generally rely on health insurance provided by private health insurance companies. If we are considered a \u201cnon-contracted provider\u201d by a third-party payer, that payer may not reimburse patients for diagnostic tests performed by us, or doctors within the payer\u2019s network of covered physicians may not use our services to perform diagnostic tests for their patients. As a result, we may need to enter into contracts with health insurance companies or other private payers to provide diagnostic tests to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement which may be lower than the rates we might otherwise collect.\nWe will be required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy of health information, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.\nThe HIPAA sets forth security regulations that establish administrative, physical and technical standards for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Protected Health Information in electronic form. We also may be required to comply with state laws that are more stringent than HIPAA or that provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their health care records. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) established certain health information security breach notification obligations that require covered entities to notify each individual whose \u201cprotected health information\u201d is breached.\nWe may incur significant compliance costs related to HIPAA and HITECH privacy regulations and varying state privacy regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. Given the complexity of HIPAA and HITECH and their overlap with state privacy and security laws, and the fact that these laws are rapidly evolving and are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to comply with the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy requirements is uncertain and the costs of compliance are significant. The costs of complying with any changes to the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions may have a negative impact on our operations. Noncompliance could subject us to criminal penalties, civil sanctions and significant monetary penalties as well as reputational damage.\nIf we are successful in commercializing DetermaVuTM or other diagnostic tests, we will be obligated to comply with numerous additional federal and state statutes and regulations pertaining to our business, and be subject to government oversight and scrutiny for our compliance with such laws. Laboratory and health care regulatory compliance efforts are expensive and time-consuming, and failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws could result in enforcement action which could be detrimental to our business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing DetermaVuTM or other diagnostic tests, and particularly if payment becomes available from government or commercial payers for DetermaVuTM we will be subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws governing various aspects of our business. We will be subject to ongoing compliance with laws addressing our laboratory licensure and certification at the federal and state level; advertising and promotion (including laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission); and laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare programs (including among others the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA), the Stark Law, and applicable state law equivalents).\nThese laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. If one or more such agencies alleges that we may be in violation of any of these requirements, regardless of the outcome, it could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, and in some circumstances we could be required to refund payments received by us from payers, or even be excluded from participation in healthcare programs. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nWe plan to adopt policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Developing a compliance infrastructure is costly and time-consuming, and even a well-designed and implemented compliance program cannot necessarily prevent all violations of relevant laws. We may be subject to enforcement action based on the actions or omissions of employees or contractors, including our anticipated sales force.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe rely on patents and trade secrets, and our financial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, protect our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nWe rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the United States and certain foreign countries. We may also use license agreements both to access technologies developed by other companies and universities and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, protect our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nWith regard to our DetermaVu\u2122, we exclusively license from Wistar two patent families with claims directed to compositions of matter and methods useful for detection of lung cancer using specific biomarkers or a panel of specific biomarkers. The first patent family has patent applications pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, India, and Japan, where, if issued, such patents would expire in 2036. The second patent family has patent applications pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, India, and Japan, where, if issued, such patents would expire in 2037. There is no assurance that patents pending will issue.\nWe may not be able to obtain patent protection for our diagnostic test if our pending U.S. patent applications are found to be directed to unpatentable subject matter.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, recent cases have held that diagnostic methods merely reciting a correlation between a naturally occurring event and a diagnostic outcome associated with that event is not patentable subject matter. If our pending U.S. patent applications are found to be directed to unpatentable subject matter by the USPTO, or any patents issuing from our pending patent applications are invalidated based on these decisions, we may be unable to prevent competitors from using the biomarkers or other subject matter disclosed in the patent applications to develop similar diagnostic tests that would compete with our tests. Additionally, there have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nChanges to the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our diagnostic test.\nOur success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. Patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law in September 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has transformed the U.S. patent system into a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system. The first-to-file provisions, however, only became effective in March 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could make it more difficult to obtain patent protection for our inventions and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our collaboration partners\u2019 patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our collaboration partners\u2019 issued patents, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our diagnostic test.\nAny patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and declared invalid or infringing of third party claims. A patent interference proceeding may be instituted with the USPTO when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent filed before March 16, 2013. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO\u2019s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us. In addition to interference proceedings, the USPTO can reexamine issued patents at the request of a third party seeking to have the patent invalidated. An inter partes review proceeding allows third parties to challenge the validity of an issued patent where there is a reasonable likelihood of invalidity. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be subject to re-examination and may be lost if the outcome of the re-examination is unfavorable to us.\nPost Grant Review under the Leahy-Smith Act makes available opposition-like proceedings in the United States. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, Post Grant Review proceedings will be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining patent protection or can result in a denial of a patent application. Further, a derivation proceeding may be instituted by the USPTO or an inventor alleging that a patent or application was derived from the work of another inventor.\nOppositions to the issuance of patents may be filed under European patent law and the patent laws of certain other countries. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, these foreign proceedings can be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining a patent or can result in a denial of a patent application.\nThe enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, our patents may not be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. The molecular diagnostics that we are developing use gene expression classifiers or algorithms, which are mathematical models that weight the biomarkers to produce a score. We will treat the mathematical models as trade secrets. We have entered into intellectual property, invention, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, and it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants. These measures, however, may not prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and know-how, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets and know-how or obtain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary technology.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. Even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court may construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question, in which case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents, if issued, on our diagnostic test candidate in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our diagnostic test in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents or where any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us.\nMoreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws. Additionally, laws of some countries outside of the United States and Europe do not afford intellectual property protection to the same extent as the laws of the United States and Europe. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, including India, China and certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in certain countries outside the United States and Europe. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, if our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our diagnostic test, and our patents, if issued, or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and resources from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for our diagnostic test, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our diagnostic test. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our diagnostic test.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or future diagnostic test, including interference proceedings before the USPTO, misappropriation claims, or other allegations. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. For example, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our diagnostic test or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nIn addition, several of our employees have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements with their previous employers, who may allege these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs, and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could significantly harm our business and operating results. We may also not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to pay monetary damages, lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, or be forced to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing diagnostic test. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing diagnostic test. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our diagnostic test or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our diagnostic test for an adequate amount of time.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new diagnostic tests, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication or any additional indications approved during the period of extension. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with BioTime\nUntil recently we were a subsidiary of BioTime, and BioTime retains a substantial stock ownership position that may allow it to assert significant influence over us.\nBioTime is our largest shareholder, owns approximately 28% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Its high level of ownership allows it to exert significant influence on our affairs, including with respect to the election of the members of our Board of Directors and other matters requiring shareholder approval. Two of the seven members of our Board of Directors are also directors of BioTime, and one of our directors is a former executive officer and director of BioTime. This commonality of directors means that representatives of BioTime, in part, oversee our management and participate in making business decisions on our behalf.\nBioTime\u2019s voting power may allow BioTime to influence our corporate actions even if the interests of BioTime conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. This concentration of voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing a change in control that might be beneficial to our other shareholders.\nWith the support of a relatively small number of other shareholders that own a substantial amount of our common stock BioTime could have the voting power to approve or disapprove any matter or corporate transaction presented to our shareholders for approval, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf Any amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u25cf Any merger or consolidation of us with another company;\n\u25cf Any recapitalization or reorganization of our capital stock;\n\u25cf Any sale of assets or purchase of assets; or\n\u25cf A corporate dissolution or a plan of liquidation of our business.\nYou may not agree with the way BioTime, or any other shareholders aligned with BioTime, vote on any of matters we submit for shareholder approval.\nWe presently rely on BioTime for certain services and resources.\nAlthough we have our own CLIA certified diagnostic laboratory, our own scientific personnel, and critical management personnel, we presently rely on BioTime to provide certain management and administrative services, including patent prosecution, certain legal services, accounting, financial management, and controls over financial accounting and reporting. We have entered into the Shared Facilities Agreement with BioTime under which we have agreed to bear costs allocated to us by BioTime for the use of BioTime office and research facilities, human resources, services, and materials provided for our benefit by BioTime. We will pay BioTime 105% of its costs of providing personnel and services to us, and for any use of its facilities by us, including an allocation of general overhead based on that use. We may also share the services of some research personnel with BioTime.\nIf BioTime\u2019s human resources and facilities are not sufficient to serve both BioTime\u2019s needs and ours, we will have to hire additional personnel of our own, either on a full-time or part-time basis, as employees or as consultants, and the cost of doing so could be greater than the costs that would be allocated to us by BioTime. Also, any new personnel that we may need to hire may not be as familiar with our business or operations as BioTime\u2019s personnel, which means that we would incur the expense and inefficiencies related to training new employees or consultants.\nConflicts of interest may arise from our relationship with BioTime.\nOur relationship with BioTime could give rise to certain conflicts of interest that could have an impact on our research and development programs, business opportunities, and operations generally.\n\u25cf Even if BioTime is not presently developing diagnostic tests, there is no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will not do so in the future. Even if we utilize different technologies than BioTime or its subsidiaries, we could find ourselves in competition with them for research scientists, financing and other resources, licensing, manufacturing, and distribution arrangements, and for customers if we and BioTime or a BioTime subsidiary both bring diagnostic tests to market.\n\u25cf BioTime may retain sufficient influence through its share ownership to deter us from engaging in research and development programs, investments, business ventures, or agreements to develop, license, or acquire diagnostic tests or technologies that would or might compete with those owned, licensed, or under development by BioTime or any of its other subsidiaries.\n\u25cf BioTime and its subsidiaries will engage for their own accounts in research and product development programs, investments, and business ventures, and we will not be entitled to participate or to receive an interest in those programs, investments, or business ventures. BioTime and its subsidiaries will not be obligated to present any particular research and development, investment, or business opportunity to us, even if the opportunity would be within the scope of our research and development plans or programs, business objectives, or investment policies. These opportunities may include, for example, opportunities to acquire businesses or assets, including but not limited to patents and other intellectual property that could be used by us or by BioTime or by any of BioTime\u2019s subsidiaries. Our respective boards of directors will have to determine whether their company should pursue those opportunities, taking into account relevant facts and circumstances at the time, such as the financial and other resources of their company to acquire and utilize the opportunity, and the extent to which the opportunity \u201cfits\u201d with the business and research and development programs of the company. However, to the extent that BioTime has sufficient voting power to elect the members of our Board of Directors, BioTime may have the ultimate say in decision making with respect to the pursuit of any opportunities that might be available to both OncoCyte and BioTime.\n\u25cf If we enter into any patent or technology license or sublicense, or any other agreement with BioTime or with a BioTime subsidiary, a conflict of interest could arise in determining how and when a party should enforce its rights under the agreement if the other BioTime company that is a party were to default or otherwise fail to perform any of its obligations under the agreement.\n\u25cf Each conflict of interest will be resolved by our respective boards of directors in keeping with their fiduciary duties and such policies as they may implement from time to time. However, the terms and conditions of agreements between us and BioTime or BioTime subsidiaries may not be negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis due to BioTime\u2019s ownership interest in us and due to the commonality of certain directors serving on our respective boards of directors.\nConflicts of interest with BioTime could arise from our ownership of BioTime common shares and BioTime\u2019s ownership of shares of our common stock.\nOne of our significant assets is 353,264 BioTime common shares that we acquired from BioTime in exchange for shares of our common stock. One of BioTime\u2019s significant assets is 14,674,244 shares of OncoCyte common stock that BioTime holds. We may sell BioTime shares to raise capital to finance our operations, and BioTime may sell its OncoCyte shares to raise capital to finance its operations. The sale of such shares by either party could have a depressing effect on the market value of the other party\u2019s common stock and the prices at which the other party can sell its own shares of common stock to raise capital to support its operations. Similarly, if we or BioTime sell shares of our own respective common stock, such sales could have a depressing effect on the market value of the common stock and the prices at which the other party can sell shares it holds in the other party.\nWe may coordinate any future sales of our BioTime common shares with BioTime, and BioTime may coordinate any future sales of their shares of OncoCyte common stock with us, in order to provide an orderly and controlled process for raising capital through the sale of those shares. This may include an agreement as to the number of shares to be sold, the time period or \u201cmarket window\u201d for selling shares, the use of a common securities broker-dealer, and a fair allocation of net sales based on average sales prices during any trading day on which we and BioTime sell those shares. However, we and BioTime may be unable to reach agreement from time to time with respect to coordinated sales of shares.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOwnership of our common stock will entail certain risks associated with the limited history of the trading of our common stock, volatility of prices for our shares, and the fact that we do not pay dividends.\nThe price of our stock may rise and fall rapidly.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of the shares of many biotechnology companies, may be highly volatile. The price of our common stock may rise or fall rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf Sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u25cf Results of or delays in preclinical testing or clinical trials of our diagnostic test candidates;\n\u25cf Announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, new diagnostic test introductions and commercial results;\n\u25cf The cost of our development programs;\n\u25cf The success of competitive diagnostic tests or technologies;\n\u25cf Litigation and other developments relating to our issued patents or patent applications or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf Conditions in the diagnostic, pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf Variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us, including the failure of our earnings to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf General economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf Changes in payer coverage and or reimbursement.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have been experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the equity securities without regard to the operating performance of the issuing companies. Broad market fluctuations, as well as industry factors and general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe implementation of a new FASB accounting standard could increase the risk that our future financial statements could be qualified by going concern uncertainty.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU No. 2014-15 defines management\u2019s responsibility to assess an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for us for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, ASU No. 2014-15 requires that an entity\u2019s management evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). As a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2014-15, we will be required to have more cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investments on hand on the date we issue or file our financial statements than had been the case during prior years in order to avoid going a concern qualification in our auditor\u2019s report and in the footnotes to our financial statements. If our financial statements were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty or if we are unable to alleviate substantial doubt as part of our going concern assessment, or both, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause we do not pay dividends, our stock may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn dividend income.\nWe do not pay cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future we anticipate that any earnings generated in our business will be used to finance the growth of our business and will not be paid out as dividends to our shareholders. Under a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, we have agreed not to pay dividends or to make any distributions or to redeem or repurchase any capital stock without Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s prior written consent while the Loan and Security Agreement remains in effect. This means that our stock may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn income from their investments.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our shares.\nThe market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and our common stock. We do not have any control over these analysts. Certain securities analysts cover our shares and they could issue reports or recommendations that are unfavorable to the price of our shares, and they could downgrade a previously favorable report or recommendation, and in either case our share price could decline as a result of the report. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our shares or fails to publish regular reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests if we issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 90,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 85,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 \u201cblank check\u201d shares of preferred stock. At December 31, 2018, there were 40,664,496 shares of common stock outstanding, 4,035,339 shares of common stock reserved for exercise of warrants and 4,532,153 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options under our employee stock option plans. No shares of preferred stock are presently outstanding.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in order to raise additional capital, or in connection with hiring or retaining employees, directors, or consultants, or in connection with future acquisitions of licenses to technology or diagnostic tests in connection with future business acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may also issue preferred stock having rights, preferences, and privileges senior to the rights of our common stock with respect to dividends, rights to share in distributions of our assets if we liquidate our company, or voting rights. Any preferred stock may also be convertible into common stock on terms that would be dilutive to holders of common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the fifth anniversary of the completion of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.", "PERMNO": 15863, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OCX"}
