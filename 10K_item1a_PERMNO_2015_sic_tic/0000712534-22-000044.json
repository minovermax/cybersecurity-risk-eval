RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial results or stock price. Additional risks that the Corporation currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial may also impair the Corporation\u2019s business or adversely impact its financial results or stock price.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely impacted the Corporation\u2019s business and financial results, and the continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the pandemic and further actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus.\nCOVID-19, which has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and declared a national emergency in the United States, continues to cause disruption in the global economy (including the states and local economies in which we operate) and instability in financial markets. The outbreak resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures, which may be implemented again in the future, significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. As a result, the demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused, and could continue to influence, the recognition of credit losses in the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolios as our customers were and are negatively impacted by economic conditions. The Corporation\u2019s allowance for credit losses is also subject to further change as our customers are impacted by economic fluctuations resulting from the pandemic. In addition, governmental actions taken in response to COVID-19 have resulted in decreased interest rates and yields, which have adversely impacted the Corporation\u2019s interest margins and which may lead to decreases in the Corporation\u2019s net interest income.\nAs our banking regulators encouraged us to work prudently with borrowers who are unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19, the Bank implemented certain hardship relief programs (including payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, and other delays in payment). As a result, the Bank has made numerous short-term loan modifications for customers who are current and otherwise not past due. As provided under the CARES Act and extended by the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, these qualified loan modifications were exempt by law from classification as troubled debt restructures, as defined by GAAP, through January 1, 2022,. The potential adverse impact resulting from the inability of customers to repay loans on a timely basis remains uncertain at this time. However, the extent of such impact, as reflected in the Corporation's financial statements, may be muted by these loan modifications, which would have the effect of delaying loan loss recognition until after any applicable deferral period.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused the Corporation to modify its business practices (including developing work from home and social distancing plans for our employees), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. Furthermore, the Corporation\u2019s business operations have been, and may again in the future be, disrupted due to vendors and third-party service providers being unable to work or provide services effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the potential for seasonal or other resurgences, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. While we do not yet know the full extent of the COVID-19 impact, the negative effects on the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\n\u2022As a participating lender in the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d or \u201cprogram\u201d), the Corporation and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s clients or other parties in connection with the Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act established the PPP, which is administered by the SBA, to fund payroll and operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the pandemic. The Bank actively participated in assisting its customers with PPP funding during all phases of the program. Because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the April 3, 2020 opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the program, which exposes the Corporation to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation relating to the policies and procedures that they used in processing applications for the program. The Corporation and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation: (1) from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank in connection with PPP loans and its policies and procedures used in processing applications for the program; and (2) from agents of the PPP borrowers claiming they are entitled to a portion of the Bank's loan processing fees as a result of their assisting borrowers with their PPP loan applications. If any such litigation is filed against the Corporation or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Corporation or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the program. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Corporation, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Bank.\nPART I: ITEM 1A.
