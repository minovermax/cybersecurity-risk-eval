You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted. There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business.\nOur business information systems could be impacted by disruptions and security breaches.\nThe Company employs information technology systems to support its global business. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers and suppliers, and expose the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. While security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure could happen, none have occurred to date that have had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its business information systems. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nOur operations may be impacted by various business interruptions.\nUncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, natural disasters, political or civil unrest in the countries in which we operate and source products from can cause property damage or interrupt our business operations. These events can lead to damaged property, lost sales or lost customers and could adversely affect our short-term results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain bank credit or generate cash flow from our operations, our financial position, liquidity and results of operations could suffer.\nWe are dependent on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining a strong balance sheet. If we lose our ability to generate cash flow from operations or our availability to borrow with our financial institutions to meet capital and operational needs, our liquidity and results of operations could suffer.\nOur products are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns. Prolonged negative economic conditions could impact our business.\nEconomic downturns and prolonged negative economic conditions could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings and commercial products. These events could impact retailers, offices, hospitality, recreational vehicle seating and healthcare businesses resulting in an impact on our business. A recovery in our sales could lag significantly behind a general economic recovery due to the deferrable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings and commercial products purchases.\nOur future success depends on our ability to manage our global supply chain.\nWe acquire raw materials, component parts and certain finished products from external suppliers, both U.S. and foreign. Many of these suppliers are dependent upon other suppliers in countries other than where they are located. This global interdependence within our supply chain is subject to delays in delivery, availability, quality and pricing (including tariffs) of products. The delivery of goods from these suppliers may be delayed by customs, labor issues, changes in political, economic and social conditions, laws and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, quality, delivery and availability of these products could negatively affect our ability to meet demands of our customers and have a negative impact on product margin.\nCompetition from U.S. and foreign finished product manufacturers may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors. As a result, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to competitive pressures or increasing costs. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to significantly differentiate our products (through styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of our competitors. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings.\nOur failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer or designer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and decrease our sales and earnings.\nFurniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer and end-user trends and tastes and is highly fashion oriented, and if we are not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety, or if we are unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit and retain key employees.\nIf we are not successful in recruiting and retaining key employees or experience the unexpected loss of key employees, our operations may be negatively impacted.\nFuture costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results.\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on our operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to comply with such laws and regulations, even inadvertently, could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact our operations.\nTerms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations.\nTerms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent us from competing effectively could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are committed to working with those groups to avert or resolve conflicts as they arise. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful.\nDue to our participation in multi-employer pension plans, we may have exposures under those plans that could extend beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees.\nWe participate in, and make periodic contributions to, three multi-employer pension plans that cover union employees. Multi-employer pension plans are managed by trustee boards comprised of participating employer and labor union representatives, and the employers participating in a multi-employer pension plan are jointly responsible for maintaining the plan\u2019s funding requirements. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in the multi-employer pension plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. As a result of our participation, we could experience greater volatility in our overall pension funding obligations. Our obligations may be impacted by the funded status of the plans, the plans\u2019 investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.\nOur future results may be affected by various legal proceedings and compliance risk, including those involving product liability, environmental, or other matters.\nWe face the business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We could incur substantial costs, including legal expenses, as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, these various legal proceedings and compliance matters could have a material impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 36768, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "FLXS"}
