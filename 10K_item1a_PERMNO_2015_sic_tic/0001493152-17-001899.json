{"cik": "1487906", "company": "CACHET FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below are the risk factors that we believe are material to our investors. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our business and any investment you have or may make in our Company.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nWe have a significant amount of secured and unsecured debt, which may affect our ability to operate our business and secure additional financing in the future, and could limit or eliminate recovery of your investment if we fail to reach profitability.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness aggregated $4.7 million (gross notes payable of $13.2 million less debt discount of $8.5 million), of which $12.9 million is payable within one year. Of the $12.9 million payable within one year, $7.1 million is convertible, at our option, into shares of our common stock following the listing of our common stock on an exchange owned by the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC.\nWe may be unable to satisfy the entirety of our debt owed to our lenders. Any such failure could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, business prospects and viability. If we are unable to pay or refinance our senior secured indebtedness when due, or if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, these junior creditors may not recover the value of their notes. As a matter of state and creditor law, common stock ranks junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, both secured and unsecured, and to other non-equity claims against our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Due to the substantial indebtedness of our company, holders of our common stock face the risk that they may not recover any portion of their investment unless all of the claims of our creditors are satisfied first or unless they are able to sell their stock prior to any such claims are asserted.\nWe received a going concern qualification from our independent registered public accounting firm, which indicates that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue, obtain financing or adjust our operating expenses so as to achieve and maintain positive working capital, we likely will be forced to cease operations and investors will likely lose their entire investment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $8.3 million. In their report dated February 24, 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm, Lurie, LLP, stated that our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were prepared under the assumption that we would be able to continue as a going concern and noted that our limited revenues, recurring losses from operations and stockholders\u2019 deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an operating cash flow deficit of $9.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively.\nWe currently anticipate that our cash and forecasted cash receipts will be sufficient to fund our operations through March 31, 2017. If we are successful in completing our Offering, we believe we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations through February 24, 2018. There can be no assurance that we will complete the Offering or that we will not require additional financing or that such financing will be available to us on reasonably acceptable terms.\nBecause we have received an opinion from our auditor that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as a going concern, it may be more difficult for us to attract investors, secure debt financing or bank loans, or a combination of the foregoing, on favorable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient revenue, obtain financing or adjust our operating expenses so as to achieve and maintain positive working capital, we likely will be forced to cease operations and investors will likely lose their entire investment. We can give no assurance as to our ability to generate adequate revenue, raise sufficient capital, sufficiently reduce operating expenses, or continue as a going concern. In addition, concerns about our financial viability may have an adverse effect on current and potential clients\u2019 willingness to enter into long-term relationships with us.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur operations and business are subject to the risks of an early stage company with little revenue at this time.\nOur business is subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. We cannot project whether or when we will become profitable because of the significant uncertainties regarding our ability to generate revenues. One of the principal challenges that we face is gaining client acceptance. We face substantial competition from well-established companies with far greater resources, and our potential clients may be more familiar with our competitors and their capabilities.\nOur future success will depend upon many factors and variables facing a new business, including factors which may be beyond our control or which cannot be predicted at this time. We have formulated our business plans and strategies based on certain assumptions regarding the acceptance of our business model and the marketing of our solutions. Nevertheless, our assessments regarding market size, market share, or market acceptance of our solutions or a variety of other factors may prove incorrect. We are a new enterprise and have not previously engaged in the market in which our solutions will be offered. In sum, we may be unable to successfully implement our business plan and become a profitable business.\nOur future revenue growth is dependent upon the success and popularity of our solutions, including our SMM-X solution. If we do not successfully market and sell our solutions to new clients, if our solutions are not widely used by their customers, or if the popularity of our solutions declines, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nTo date, our growth has resulted primarily from selling our solutions to new clients and enabling our clients to deploy these solutions for use by their customers. We expect that our success will continue to depend to a large extent on the continuing broad market acceptance of our solutions among financial institutions, AFS providers and their customers.\nOur future revenue also depends in part on our ability to attract new clients, including additional financial institutions and AFS providers, for our solutions and assist our clients with their deployment efforts. For example, our financial model is based in part on our ability to successfully sell and deploy our SMM-X solution to banks, credit unions and AFS providers, and upon this solution becoming widely used by our clients\u2019 customers. Specifically, our financial model for our SMM-X solution is based principally on future transactions and/or user-fee components. Hence, the wide adoption of our SMM-X solution by our clients\u2019 customers is critical to our future revenue growth. Our financial model is also based on our belief that there are significant opportunities for sales of our other solutions to additional clients. If we are unable to sell our solutions, including our SMM-X solution, and achieve broad adoption of our solutions by financial institutions and AFS providers, or if our solutions are not widely used by their customers after they are deployed, then our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur clients\u2019 customers may not currently use our solutions for a number of reasons, including unfamiliarity with the technology or perceived lack of reliability. We believe that the acceptance of our solutions by our clients and their customers also depends on the following factors:\n\u25cf our clients\u2019 and our clients\u2019 customers\u2019 beliefs on the importance of our solutions;\n\u25cf our ability to demonstrate our solutions economic and other benefits;\n\u25cf our clients\u2019 acceptance of us as a service provider; and\n\u25cf the reliability of the software and hardware comprising our solutions.\nEven if we are successful in refining, selling and servicing our solutions, the market may slow or not grow fast enough for us to attain profitability in the near future, if ever. If our solutions fall out of favor, or if our solutions fail to win consumer acceptance, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have only recently begun to market our SMM-X solution as a separate brand under our Select Mobile Money solutions. We are in the process of developing a separate brand for this solution. If we fail to develop, maintain and protect a strong brand for our SMM-X solution, we may not be successful in selling this solution to banks, credit unions and AFS providers and our business will suffer.\nWe have only recently begun to market our SMM-X solution as a separate brand under our Select Mobile Money solutions. We are in the process of developing a separate brand for this solution. We believe that the development of a strong and trusted brand for this solution is important to our success in selling it to banks, credit unions and/or AFS providers and is critical to expanding our client base. Any negative publicity about our industry, our company or the quality and reliability of our SMM-X solution could adversely affect our ability to develop, maintain and protect our SMM-X brand. If we fail to successfully develop, maintain and protect a strong and trusted separate brand for our SMM-X solution, we may not be successful in marketing and selling it and our business and results of operations will suffer.\nIn deploying our SMM-X solution, we will need to rely on the services of a sponsor bank that issues the reloadable prepaid cards to our prospective clients\u2019 customers. Any refusal by such reloadable prepaid card issuer to work with any of our clients, the distributor of the reloadable prepaid card, will materially and adversely affect our ability to sell this solution and will have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur SMM-X solution will utilize the services of a bank, which we refer to as a \u201csponsor bank,\u201d that issues the reloadable prepaid cards to our prospective clients\u2019 customers. Our client is the distributor of the reloadable prepaid card issued by the sponsor bank. Our sponsor bank may refuse to work with any prospective financial institution or AFS provider for any reason, including lack of sufficient financial controls and/or lack of adequate measures to protect customer privacy. Any refusal by a sponsor bank to work with any of our clients will materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our SMM-X solution and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our business.\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our brand is predicated on the idea that innovative solutions should enable our clients to offer their customers fast, reliable and convenient financial services remotely through mobile platforms. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our client base and our third-party partners. This will depend largely on our ability to maintain trust, be a technology leader, and continue to provide high-quality and secure solutions. Any negative publicity about our industry or our company, the quality and reliability of our solutions, our risk management processes, changes to our solutions, our ability to effectively manage and resolve client complaints, our privacy and security practices, litigation, regulatory activity, and the experience of clients with our solutions, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in and use of our solutions. Harm to our brand can arise from many sources, including failure by us to satisfy expectations; inadequate protection of sensitive information; compliance failures and claims; litigation and other claims; employee misconduct; and misconduct by our partners, supplies or other counterparties. If we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. To date, our brand has been associated with the term \u201cCACHET.\u201d As a result of a judgment and permanent injunction against us, we must cease the use of this term for all purposes in our business as of April 15, 2017 and we must engage in a re-branding of our business under a new name. We have not yet announced our new brand name and we cannot predict how our customers will respond to our new name or whether our re-branding will impact our business or results of operations. We will be required to spend significant resources, both financial and management time, toward advertising and marketing related to our re-branding. We estimate the expenses related to the re-branding will be between $200,000 and $300,000 over a six-month period during 2017. See the risk factor below entitled \u201cWe must change our name and rebrand our company\u201d concerning a judgment that requires us to change our character mark \u201cCACHET.\u201d\nWe cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing our revenue by introducing new revenue streams.\nImportant factors to our future growth include continued development and marketing of our solutions to existing clients and making our solutions increasingly attractive with the need for applications or combinations of applications tailored to their specific needs. For example, we have only recently begun offering our end-to-end reloadable prepaid card program for our SMM-X solutions to banks, credit unions and AFS providers. This program has individual challenges and risks, and we cannot be certain that this program, or any of our other development and marketing efforts and activities will contribute to substantial revenue or introduce substantial new revenue streams. Our failure to introduce substantial new revenue streams, including as a result of our inability to generate revenues from our new SMM-X program, will have a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations.\nWe compete with other companies that are well established and have more resources, and we may also compete against technologies developed in-house by some of our clients or potential clients, all of which puts us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe market for prepaid mobile money and RDC solutions is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase. Most of our competitors or potential competitors (e.g., FIS, Fiserv, D+H, Jack Henry, Bluepoint Solutions and Goldleaf ProfitStars) have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in client requirements. They are also able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. On occasion, we may also have potential clients who have developed their prepaid mobile money or RDC solutions internally, and so our competition may come from within the clients themselves, sometimes making it more difficult to consummate a transaction due to territoriality, bias toward in-house developed capabilities, or concerns about our support availability in comparison to in-house support.\nWe expect competitors to continue to improve the performance of their products and to introduce new solutions and technologies. Successful new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could affect our sales and the market acceptance of our solutions, cause intense price competition or make our solutions obsolete. To be competitive, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. If we do not have sufficient resources to make these investments, or are unable to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive, our competitive position will suffer. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we are unable to adapt our solutions and develop or acquire new technology to keep with these rapid changes, we will not be able to obtain or maintain market share.\nThe market for our solutions is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in our clients\u2019 needs and the needs of our clients\u2019 customers. Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater capabilities and resources to develop and test new technology more rapidly than we do. We must respond to changing technology and industry standards in a timely and cost-effective manner. We may not be successful in acquiring new technologies, developing or acquiring new solutions or enhancing existing solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. These new technologies or enhancements may not achieve market acceptance. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on financially favorable terms. Finally, we may not succeed in adapting our solutions to new technologies as they emerge.\nIn addition, under various agreements with our clients that purchase our prepaid mobile money solutions, we are required to comply with certain industry security standards called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, in order to meet these clients\u2019 requirements, and also industry demands and best practices. Compliance with the PCI DSS and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to achieve compliance with the PCI DSS or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them. In addition, we may have to upgrade our existing information technology systems from time to time, in order for such systems to withstand the increasing needs of our expanding business. Any material interruption experienced by our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of our existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our business.\nIf the Federal Reserve System adopts and implements its initiative for electronic alternatives to the paper check, government agencies may no longer issue paper checks and the use of paper checks will decline significantly, which will materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe Federal Reserve System is currently advocating for facilitating and implementing electronic alternatives to the paper check. This initiative is still underway and no final conclusions have been made. However, if this initiative is adopted and implemented, whether fully or partially, government agencies may no longer issue paper checks. For example, the U.S. Social Security Administration may no longer issue paper checks for the payment of social security benefits. As a result, the use of paper checks may decline significantly, revenues from our RDC solutions may decline significantly, and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to the storage of our clients\u2019 and their customers\u2019 confidential and proprietary information, including risks related to cyber-security and security breaches. Our systems and processes may not provide absolute security. We may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nOur solutions are designed to maintain the confidentiality and security of our clients\u2019 and their customers\u2019 confidential and proprietary information that is stored on our systems, which may include sensitive financial data. We are entirely dependent on the secure operation of our websites and systems as well as the operation of the Internet generally. As a result, we face risks related to accidental or willful security breaches (including unauthorized access to this data), which could expose us to liability for the loss or misuse of such information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity. Attacks may be targeted at us, our clients or both. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users\u2019 or clients\u2019 data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or clients to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or clients\u2019 data. Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks.\nOur maintenance and regular upgrade of our systems and processes, which are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our clients, may not provide absolute security. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the company such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile and other Internet-based solution offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based solutions and applications or expand into new countries. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are difficult to recognize and react to. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative or reactionary measures.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our clients, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our clients and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our clients, loss of confidence in our security measures, client dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, client perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of clients. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.\nOur ability to sell our solutions is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings, and our failure to offer high-quality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOnce our solution is deployed within our clients\u2019 networks, our clients depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our software and solutions. As a result, high-quality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our software and solutions, including the renewal of term-based license agreements and service agreements. If we do not assist our clients in deploying our software solutions effectively, succeed in helping our clients resolve post-deployment issues quickly, or provide ongoing support, our existing clients may not renew their license or maintenance and support agreements with us or buy additional software and solutions from us. Furthermore, our failure to provide our existing clients with high-quality support could harm our reputation with potential clients. If we fail to manage these resources correctly, our business will suffer. In addition, if we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. Our failure to maintain high-quality support and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe rely on third-parties to provide software integration, hardware, fulfillment and support and maintenance services in connection with our solutions, and these third-parties\u2019 failure to perform these services adequately could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWhile we believe we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business, we do not own outright all of the technologies, including software, that are used in our solutions. We may develop proprietary software for our solutions by using imaging, mobile solutions or other technologies from various partners. For example, our RDC solutions utilize software and hardware from multiple third-party vendors such as Mitek Systems Inc., Parascript, LLC and AQ2 Technologies, LLC. We expect that we will continue to rely on multiple third-party vendors to create competitive software offerings for our clients and to provide them with state-of-the-art solutions. In the event these third-parties fail to provide these services adequately, including as a result of errors in their systems or events beyond their control, or refuse to provide these services on terms acceptable to us or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also rely on cooperation among our third-party vendors, and if they are unwilling to work with us or one another to perform needed integration services, our ability to provide competitive software offerings may be adversely impacted. The performance of our solutions depends upon the performance and quality of third-party solutions, including hardware fulfillment, support and maintenance. If the systems provided by third-parties develop technical or operations problems, or cannot be scaled to meet the needs of our clients, or the third-parties do not perform required services in a timely manner, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our solutions have defects or if we fail to provide agreed upon solutions to our clients and our clients\u2019 customers, it could materially damage our reputation, sales and profitability and result in other costs.\nThe solutions we provide to our clients and industry partners, including those licensed from third-parties and those we develop, are extremely complex and are constantly being modified and improved, and as such, they may contain material undetected defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. As a result of such software errors or defects, we could face loss or delay in recognition of revenues, delay in market acceptance of our solutions, sales credits or refunds to our clients, loss of existing clients and difficulty in attracting new clients, diversion of development resources, harm to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs, any of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, our contracts with users and partners contain provisions that may require us to remedy malfunctions in our solutions and to pay damages if we breach our contractual obligations. Although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in delivering our solutions, these limitations on liability may be unenforceable in some cases, or may be insufficient to protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or may be insufficient to cover one or more large claims. An insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co-insurance requirement, could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms, we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFailure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. Our contracts with clients generally run for a period of 12 to 36 months. At the end of the contract term, clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide solutions. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and favorable contract terms, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause some of our sales efforts are targeted at large financial institutions, we face prolonged sales cycles, substantial upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales. If our sales cycle lengthens, or if our upfront sales investments do not result in sufficient revenue, our operating results may be harmed.\nWe target a portion of our sales efforts at large financial institutions, which presents challenges that are different from those we encounter with smaller clients. Because our large clients are often making an enterprise-wide decision to deploy our solutions, we face longer sales cycles, substantial upfront sales costs, significant contract negotiations and less predictability in completing sales with these clients. Our sales cycle can often last one year or more with our largest clients, who often undertake an extended evaluation process, but is variable and difficult to predict and can be longer or shorter. If we begin to expand internationally, we anticipate that we may experience even longer sales cycles, more complex client needs, higher upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing sales with our larger clients and clients located outside of the United States. If our sales cycle lengthens or our upfront sales investments do not generate sufficient revenue to justify our investments in our sales efforts, our operating results may be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon our clients\u2019 active and effective promotion of our solutions.\nOur success depends upon our clients, their willingness to effectively promote our solutions to their customers, and their customers\u2019 adoption and use of our solutions. In general, our contracts with our clients allow them to exercise significant discretion over the promotion of our solutions, and they could give higher priority to other solutions that they offer. Accordingly, losing the support of our clients would likely limit or reduce the use of our solutions and the related revenue. Our revenue may also be negatively affected by our clients\u2019 operational decisions. For example, if a client implements changes in its systems that disrupt the integration between its systems and ours, we could experience a decline in the use of our solutions. Even if our clients actively and effectively promote our solutions, there can be no assurance that their efforts will result in increased usage of our solutions by their customers or the growth of our revenue. Failure of our clients to effectively promote our solutions, and of their customers to increasingly adopt and use our solutions, could have a material adverse effect upon our future revenue and operating results.\nOur reputation is critical to our business, and if our reputation is harmed our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur reputation, which depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our current and potential clients and our clients\u2019 customers, is critical to our business. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or investigations, data security breaches, lawsuits, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest and rumors, among other developments, could substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. In addition, any perception that the quality of our solutions may not be the same or better than that of other providers could also damage our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain clients and key associates and adversely affect our operating results. Attempts to repair our reputation, if damaged, may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nAs a result of our clients\u2019 increased usage of our platform, we will need to continually improve our hosting infrastructure to meet our clients\u2019 needs and avoid service interruptions or slower system performance.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of transactions and data that our hosting infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our existing and new clients. If our business continues to grow, we may also need to increase bandwidth, storage or other elements of our infrastructure.\nThe amount of infrastructure needed to support our clients is based on our estimates of anticipated usage. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our clients could experience service outages or slower system performance that may subject us to financial penalties and result in client losses, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth. In addition, increasing our infrastructure as a result of experiencing unforeseen increases in usage or in anticipation of increased usage from new or existing clients would cause us to have increased cost of revenue, which could adversely affect our gross margins until we sufficiently increase revenue to offset the increased costs.\nOur solutions may not function as intended due to human error, power or Internet connectivity issues, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have from time to time found defects in our software and hardware, internal systems and technical integrations with third-party systems, and new errors may be introduced in the future. In addition, we provide frequent incremental releases of solution updates and functional enhancements, which increases the possibility of errors. Since clients use our solutions for important aspects of their businesses, any errors, defects, disruptions in services, or other performance problems with our solutions could hurt our reputation and damage our clients\u2019 businesses.\nIt is important that our solutions are available for processing to our clients on a 24/7/365 basis. We rely on our ISP to provide consistent service and administration, keep up with technical requirements and innovations, and maintain industry standards of redundancy and recovery. If our ISP does not meet these requirements, our image may suffer in the marketplace and we could lose clients.\nOur solutions must integrate with a variety of mobile devices and desktop hardware, including to enable merchants and consumers to capture information. If we are unable to ensure that our solutions integrate with such mobile devices and desktop hardware, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the ability of our solutions to integrate with a variety of mobile devices and desktop hardware. Any changes in these devices that degrade the functionality of our solutions, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive solutions, including their own solutions, could materially and adversely affect usage of our solutions.\nIn addition, we rely on scanners supplied by vendors for our commercial RDC solutions and on such vendors to provide technical support in connection with such scanners. Changes in the design of these scanners may limit the interoperability of our hardware with such scanners and require modifications to our hardware. If we are unable to ensure that our hardware continues to interoperate effectively with such scanners, or if doing so is costly, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party app marketplaces to drive downloads of our mobile apps, such as our RDC mobile apps. If third-parties block or limit our access to any app marketplaces, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on app marketplaces, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, to drive downloads of our mobile app. Apple, Google and other operators of app marketplaces regularly make changes to their marketplaces, and those changes may make access to our solutions more difficult. In the event that it is difficult for consumers to access and use our apps, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nPrivacy concerns could have an adverse impact on our revenue and harm our reputation and may require us to modify our operations.\nThe financial services industry, and in particular banks, credit unions and companies involved in the check-cashing business, are concerned about the maintenance of client privacy and compliance with consumer privacy requirements under laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure on our part to comply, and even the failure of a competitor of ours in our industry, may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and clients, which could potentially have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our solutions are Internet based, the amount of data we store for users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security, or lapses by competitors in our industry, that results in the release of users\u2019 data could seriously limit the adoption of our solutions, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of Internet-based solutions we offer.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nFailure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers might result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.\nWe require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of information through our solutions. Our contracts with our clients include assurances from them that they have done so and will do so, but we do not audit our clients to ensure that they have acted, and continue to act, consistent with such assurances. If, despite these requirements and contractual obligations, our clients do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf might be limited or prohibited by federal, state or foreign privacy laws or other laws. Such a failure to obtain proper permissions and waivers could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and might prevent use of such data. In addition, such a failure could interfere with, or prevent creation or use of, rules, analyses, or other data-driven activities that benefit us and our business. Moreover, we might be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notices, agreements, permissions or waivers. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny new and significant sustained growth will likely place a strain on our management systems and operational resources. Our ability to compete effectively and to manage our future growth, if any, will depend on our ability to maintain and improve operational, financial, and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand, train, motivate and manage our work force. If we begin to grow significantly, we cannot be certain that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations.\nWe face risks in expanding into new geographic regions.\nWe plan to continue expanding into new geographic regions, and we currently face and will continue to face risks entering markets in which we have limited or no experience and in which we may not be well-known. Offering our solutions in new geographic regions often requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and we may not be successful enough in these new geographies to recoup our investments in a timely manner or at all. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of sellers, fail to anticipate competitive conditions, or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets.\nThe expansion of our solutions globally exposes us to risks relating to staffing and managing cross-border operations; increased costs and difficulty protecting intellectual property and sensitive data; tariffs and other trade barriers; differing and potentially adverse tax consequences; increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements, including with respect to data privacy and security; lack of acceptance of our solutions; challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences; exchange rate risk; and political instability. Accordingly, our efforts to expand our global operations may not be successful, which could limit our ability to grow our business.\nFinancial institutions are subject to industry consolidation, and we may lose clients with little notice, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nThe financial institution industry is prone to consolidations that result from mergers and acquisitions. Other financial institutions that do not use our solutions may acquire our existing clients and then convert them to competing solutions. It is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the solutions which we currently provide or could provide. Most of our contracts provide for a charge to the client for early termination of the contract without cause, but these charges are insufficient to replace the recurring revenues that we would have received if the financial institution had continued as a client.\nIf our clients or their customers are unwilling to use our cloud-based solutions, our client base may not grow or may decrease and our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nMany enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate legacy enterprise software into their businesses and are more familiar and comfortable with this type of infrastructure. Because our solutions involve the aggregation, storage and use of confidential information and related data, some clients may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to our cloud-based solutions due to a lack of perceived cost and performance benefits associated with cloud-based solutions, and concerns regarding the ability of cloud computing companies to adequately address security and privacy concerns. If other cloud-based solutions experience security incidents, loss of client data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, these concerns and perceptions regarding the market for cloud computing as a whole may be further negatively affected. If clients are unwilling to accept our cloud-based solutions as a result of these perceptions and concerns, we may be required to develop other alternative solutions for these clients, which would be time-consuming and costly and could negatively affect our gross margins. In addition, negative perceptions and concerns regarding cloud computing could cause the growth of our client base to slow, which could result in decreased revenue and harm to our business and results of operations.\nWe are a party to a pending legal proceeding brought against us by one of our note holders that alleges that we breached the terms of the note issued to such note holder. If this note holder prevails in this legal proceeding, we may be subject to claims of default or cross default by our other note holders, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA holder of our series subordinated note commenced an action against us in Hennepin County Court in the State of Minnesota alleging that we breached the terms of the note and seeking to collect alleged amounts due and owing under the note. The dispute centers on the note holder\u2019s interpretation of the agreement. Based on the note holder\u2019s interpretation of the agreement, the note holder seeks an extraordinary amount in alleged liquidated damages (approximately $300,000 on an outstanding debt of approximately $415,000), and we contend the note holder\u2019s interpretation is unenforceable under Minnesota law. We dispute the allegations of the note holder and intend to vigorously defend the claim. The note holder moved for summary judgment and a hearing on that motion was held on August 9, 2016 before the Fourth Judicial District in Hennepin County in Minnesota where the Court heard both arguments and took the motion under advisement. On October 19, 2016, the Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion for summary judgment. The alleged default could subject us to claims of default or cross default by our other lenders. At this time no other lender has asserted such a claim.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods, other natural catastrophic events and man-made problems such as power disruptions or terrorism.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our corporate headquarters and cloud network operations centers are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This region is known for tornado risk. Further, if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues, clients in that region may delay or forego purchases of our solutions, which may materially and adversely impact our operating results for a particular period. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our partners, clients or the economy as a whole. To the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of client orders, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe face risks arising from acquisitions.\nIn March 2014, we acquired certain assets related to our Select Mobile Money solutions from DeviceFidelity. We may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing clients of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions and other strategic transactions. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time.\nWe have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs part of our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that we do not have adequate controls in place to ensure complex financial instruments are properly accounted for and reported in our financial statements. The ineffectiveness of the design, implementation and operation of the controls surrounding these instruments create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, our management concluded that this deficiency represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.\nInternal controls over financial reporting are processes designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, cause our consolidated financial statements to contain material misstatements, and harm our business and operating results. Our internal controls may not prevent all potential errors, because any control system, regardless of its design, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved.\nSo long as we are either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which requires an independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our management\u2019s assessment of internal control over the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are neither an emerging growth company nor a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest on our management\u2019s assessment of internal control over the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. This may cause us to incur additional costs related to auditing and also the examination, investigation and report on internal controls.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective.\nWe could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. Our risk management policies, procedures and techniques, including our scoring methodology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.\nOur business may be materially and adversely affected by U.S. and global market and economic conditions.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from solutions we provide to the financial services industry. Given this concentration, we are exposed to the global economic conditions in the financial services industry. A prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our solutions and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Workforce and Personnel\nWe are a small company with limited staff, particularly in our accounting department. Our limited staff and resources have in the past adversely affected our internal controls over financial reporting. Our failure to implement measures that will ensure adequate controls over our financial and other reporting processes could cause us to fail to meet our financial and other reporting obligations.\nWhile we continue to evaluate and improve our internal controls, we are a small company with limited staff, particularly in our accounting department which consists of primarily three full-time employees: our Chief Financial Officer, our Corporate Controller and our SEC Financial Reporting Manager. We also have a part time accounting clerk. Our key accounting and finance personnel have only recently begun to serve in such capacities. Our Chief Financial Officer joined our company in March 2016, our Corporate Controller has served in such capacity from July 2015 and our SEC Financial Reporting Manager joined our company in July 2016.\nOur limited accounting staff may not allow for effective internal controls over financial reporting due to the lack of adequate segregation of duties and insufficient secondary review of GAAP. For example, our company has issued, and may in the future issue, warrants, convertible notes and convertible redeemable preferred stock, and we may lack experience in accounting for complex transactions. We have recently implemented an automated third party software solution for tracking and reporting of stock options and related compensation expenses, instead doing so manually.\nDue to our current staffing limitations, we cannot be certain that the measures we implement in the future will ensure that we design, undertake and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting. Any failure by us to hire and retain experienced accounting and financial reporting personnel, implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. See the risk factor above entitled \u201cWe have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\u201d\nBecause we are a small company with limited staff and we do not employ an in-house general counsel or have a legal compliance department, we might not always be able to timely file every periodic and current report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Our failure to file certain reports with SEC in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and our stockholders, and may also result in the suspension of trading of our common and/or the revocation of our registration by the SEC.\nWe are a small company with limited staff. We do not employ an in-house general counsel or have a legal compliance department. This may adversely affect our disclosure controls and procedures, including our ability to timely file periodic or current reports with the SEC from time to time. For example, there have been instances in the past where we have not filed a current report on a timely basis or at all. In addition, on March 30, 2016, we filed with the SEC a notification of late filing informing the SEC that due to staffing limitations we could not timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Our failure to file periodic and certain current reports with the SEC in a timely manner, among other things, could in the future preclude or delay us from being eligible to use a short form registration statement on Form S-3 to register certain sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders and could even result in the suspension of trading of our common stock and/or the revocation of our registration by the SEC. Any of these consequences may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and can also adversely affect our stockholders.\nOur success may depend on our ability to attract, recruit and retain qualified and skilled personnel, including qualified and skilled programmers and sales, marketing and support personnel.\nOur key personnel currently include:\n\u25cf Jeffrey C. Mack, Chief Executive Officer and President\n\u25cf Bruce Whitmore, Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer\n\u25cf Lawrence C. Blaney, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing\n\u25cf Bryan Meier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOur future success depends significantly on the continued service of our key technical, sales and senior management personnel and their ability to execute our growth strategy, as well as on our ability to attract, recruit and retain additional qualified and skilled technical, sales and senior management associates. If we fail to retain our key associates (including due to death or disability) or to attract, recruit and retain additional qualified and skilled associates, our ability to maintain and develop our business and solutions may be materially and adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nIn this regard, we do not have any key-person insurance on any of our key associates. We have written employment agreements with all but one of our key associates, and all of those agreements contain customary non-competition and other restrictive covenants benefitting our company, but these agreements do not guarantee the services of these individuals for the terms of their agreements or beyond.\nIn order for us to continue to develop and market our new solutions and for our business to continue to grow, we need to attract, recruit and retain additional qualified and skilled personnel. Our failure to do so will materially and adversely affect our ability to develop and market our new solutions, which will have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe will need to attract, recruit and retain additional qualified and skilled personnel in order for us to be able to develop and market our new solutions, including our SMM-X solutions. If we fail to attract, recruit and retain additional qualified and skilled personnel, we will not be successful in developing and marketing our new solutions or enhancing our existing solutions, which will have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nOur clients operate in a highly-regulated environment, and failure by financial institutions and AFS providers through which our solutions are made available to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur clients operate in a highly-regulated environment at the federal and state levels and failure by financial institutions and AFS providers through which our solutions are made available to comply with the laws and regulations to which we and they are subject could negatively impact our business. In addition, our clients have and may in the future require us to adhere to standards relating to high levels of security, the maintenance of client privacy and other regulatory areas that they are obligated meet in their compliance with such laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such requirements. Any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business and its viability, as well as the price of our common stock.\nChanges in banking regulations could negatively affect our business.\nOur financial institution clients are subject to the supervision of several federal, state and local government regulatory agencies, and we must continually ensure that our solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our financial institution clients. Regulation of financial institutions such as banks can indirectly affect our business. While the use of our solutions by financial institutions is either not subject to, or is currently in compliance with, banking regulations, a change in regulations or the creation of new regulations on financial institutions, including modifying a financial institution\u2019s ability to offer solutions similar to ours, could prevent or lessen the use of our solutions by financial institutions, which would have a substantial negative effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to execute our business strategy will depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property, and if any third-parties make unauthorized use of our intellectual property, or if our intellectual property rights are successfully challenged, our competitive position and business could suffer.\nOur success and ability to compete will depend substantially on our ability to develop proprietary technologies. We currently own no patents, but have filed several applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These include an application filed in October 2010, relating to our Apple OS X Internet deposit application. We cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights will not be infringed upon, that others will not develop products in violation of our intellectual property rights, or that others may assert, rightly or wrongly, that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. In instances where we may rely on trade secrets for the protection of our confidential and proprietary business information, we cannot be certain that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become discovered or, for that matter, independently developed by our competitors. In general, defending intellectual property rights is expensive and consumes considerable time and attention of management. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation would likely have a materially and adverse effect on our business and may threaten our viability. Even if we were ultimately successful in defending our intellectual property rights, the cost of such defense may be crippling to our business and materially and adversely affect our prospects and viability.\nIn addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. There can be no assurance that we will obtain patents on the inventions disclosed in our provisional application or on any future patent applications, nor can there be any assurance that the scope of any future patent will be sufficiently broad to offer us meaningful protection.\nOur intellectual property rights are currently not protected outside the United States. If we begin to expand internationally, we will need to obtain legal protection for our intellectual property rights, which will cause us to incur substantial costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that legal protection can be afforded to our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe have not filed any patent applications outside the United States. If we begin to expand internationally, we will need to obtain legal protection for our intellectual property rights, including by filing patent applications in various jurisdictions, which will cause us to incur substantial costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such legal protection can be afforded and our intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable altogether in some foreign jurisdictions, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in such jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird-parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our solutions.\nThird-parties may bring claims against us alleging that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights or claims that our intellectual property rights are not valid. Any claims against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate, divert our attention and resources, result in the loss of goodwill associated with our business or require us to make changes to our solutions. In addition, we may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, may result in substantial costs and a diversion of our resources.\nWe must change our name and re-brand our company.\nAn entity named Cachet Banq contacted us in December 2010 relative to their U.S. Trademark Registration No. 2,857,465 (registered on June 29, 2004) for the standard character mark \u201cCACHET\u201d covering \u201cfinancial services, namely automated clearing house processing services for the payroll service industry.\u201d Cachet Banq has alleged that our use of \u201cCACHET\u201d infringes on their federal trademark registration. On or about March 4, 2013, Cachet Banq filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The initial brief was filed on May 30, 2014, replies were filed on June 26, 2014 and the court took these motions under advisement on July 8, 2014. We have denied that our use of the character mark \u201cCACHET\u201d infringes on Cachet Banq\u2019s purported rights in their mark. On September 21, 2015, the court issued an order (1) granting Cachet Banq\u2019s motion for summary judgment, (2) denying our motion for summary judgment, and (3) ordering the parties to submit memoranda regarding remedies. The last of those memoranda were submitted on October 12, 2015. On November 30, 2015, the Court entered an additional order providing for an additional period of discovery and additional briefing regarding remedies. Pursuant to the Court\u2019s order, the parties engaged in a renewed period of discovery focused on remedies and submitted additional briefing. The discovery was completed and all additional briefing was submitted to the Court by April 19, 2016. According to their briefing on the remedies, Cachet Banq is not presently seeking any monetary damages as a result of the alleged infringement, but rather an injunction.\nOn October 27, 2016, the Court entered a judgment and permanent injunction against us which, effective from April 15, 2017, enjoins us and our officers, directors, agents, servants, employees and attorneys and all persons in active concert or participation with any of the foregoing from (i) using any mark, name, symbol, logo or other indicia that incorporates or is confusingly similar to the term \u201cCACHET\u201d in any way that relates to financial services, and (ii) offering for sale, soliciting sales, promoting, distributing, importing, advertising, or selling any products or services, in any medium, under any mark, name, symbol, logo or other indicia that incorporates or is confusingly similar to the term \u201cCACHET\u201d which in any way relate to financial services. We are also ordered to destroy or discard all signs, products, advertisements, packaging, literature, business cards, and any other promotional material, which feature the term \u201cCACHET\u201d or a term confusingly similar thereto, both physical and electronic, which are in any way related to financial services, in each case except for the permitted use described below. Under the injunction, we must complete our transition to a yet-to-be determined new company name by no later than April 15, 2017. We are permitted to reference our current name in an explanatory fashion on signs, products, advertisements, packaging, literature, business cards, and any other promotional material to introduce our new name in a font size no greater than one-third the font-size of the yet-to-be determined new company name. This permitted use provision terminates on June 30, 2017, by which date we must cease from using the explanatory statement in any manner and destroy or discard all materials featuring the explanatory statement. By no later than July 12, 2017, we must file a declaration, under penalty of perjury, setting forth in detail the manner and form in which we have complied with the injunction.\nWe intend to comply with the injunction and will pursue a re-branding of our company. We expect that the re-branding will require us to devote significant resources to advertising and marketing new brands and will cause us to incur substantial costs. We estimate the expenses related to the re-branding will be between $200,000 and $300,000 over a six-month period during 2017. The Court denied Cachet Banq\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\nThe intellectual property behind our technology includes pending patent protection, as well as unpublished know-how. All patent protection eventually expires, and unpublished know-how is dependent on key individuals.\nThe commercialization of our technology is partially dependent upon know-how and trade secrets held by certain individuals working with and for us. Because the expertise runs deep in these few individuals, if something were to happen to any or all of them, the ability to properly operate our technologies without compromising quality and performance could be diminished greatly.\nEven if our pending patent applications are approved and our patents are registered, knowledge published in the form of patents has finite protection, as all patents have a limited life and an expiration date. While continuous efforts will made to apply for additional patents if appropriate, there is no guarantee that additional patents will be granted. The expiration of patents relating to our technology may hinder our ability to sub-license or sell the technology for a long period of time without the development of a more complex licensing strategy.\nOur use of\u2009\u201dopen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.\nPortions of our prepaid mobile money solutions, Select Mobile\u2122 Money and other solutions incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software. In addition, we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to specified conditions, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software and could be required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the sale of the affected solution. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by third-parties claiming ownership of software that what we believe is open source software. Any such litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest, and our business may be adversely affected. We currently have registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential collaborators or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. Further, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks or trade names that incorporate variations of our trademarks or trade names. In addition, we have not registered our trademarks internationally, and the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Over the long term, if we are unable to successfully register our trademarks and trade names and/or establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Organization\nProvisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to obtain control of us. For example, Delaware law contains a business combination statute. The anti-takeover effect of the business combination statue could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u25cf only a majority of our directors are authorized to call a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors and stockholder proposals for business at a meeting; and\n\u25cf our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, by our Board of Directors without any stockholder approval.\nBecause these provisions and laws could discourage takeover attempts, even when a change of control would be beneficial to a stockholder, these provisions and laws could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nBeing a public company whose securities are traded on a national stock exchange results in additional expenses and diverts management\u2019s attention, and could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified directors.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Even though we are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and therefore subject to reduced disclosure requirements, these requirements generate significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. In addition, after the listing of our common stock for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we will be subject to certain corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. For example, under the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, a majority of our Board of Directors must be comprised of independent directors; we must establish board committees (such as a compensation committee and an audit committee) whose members must be independent, subject to certain exceptions; our board committees must be able to engage with independent consultants and advisors; and we must make periodic reports to the Nasdaq Capital Market. We will incur additional expenses that we have not incurred previously in order to satisfy these requirements. In addition, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have an adverse and even material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur common stock is currently categorized as, and may again in the future constitute, a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may make it difficult to sell shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently categorized as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which is generally defined in Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.\nBeing a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d our common stock is subject to certain SEC rules and requirements. For example, the penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock. The penny-stock rules severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market, and many brokers choose not to participate in penny-stock transactions. As a result, there is generally less trading in penny stocks.\nOn January 17, 2017, our Board of Directors approved for submission to a vote of our stockholders the grant of authority to the Board of Directors to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of our common stock, which we refer to as the Reverse Stock Split. At a special meeting of our stockholders on February 9, 2017, our stockholders approved the proposal, granting our Board of Directors the authority, but not the obligation, to implement the Reverse Stock Split, at any time in a ratio of not less than 1-for-1.01 and not more than 1-for-4, with the final ratio to be determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors does not expect to implement the Reverse Stock Split except to the extent it is necessary and appropriate to facilitate our next underwritten public offering or otherwise necessary to satisfy the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, even if we implement the Reverse Stock Split and our common stock is no longer categorized as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d our common stock may in the future become a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and if this occurs the statutory safe harbor protection will not be applicable to us in the event of certain legal actions based upon forward-looking statements. The lack of this protection in a contested proceeding could harm our financial condition and, ultimately, the value of our common stock.\nIf our common stock becomes or remains a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d our shareholders may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock in a public broker\u2019s transaction, if at all, at the times and prices that they feel are fair or appropriate. In addition, because of our status as a penny stock issuer and our former status as a shell company, we are an \u201cineligible issuer\u201d under the Securities Act. This means that we will not be able to use certain streamlined registration procedures, including those that permit the use of free writing prospectuses and permit incorporation by reference.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation grants our Board of Directors the power to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to designate other classes of preferred stock, all without stockholder approval.\nOur authorized capital consists of 520,000,000 shares of capital stock of which 20,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock. Our Board of Directors, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares of preferred stock in such series as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights, provided it is consistent with Delaware law.\nThe rights of holders of our preferred stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our common stock. Furthermore, any issuances of additional stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of then-current holders of our capital stock and may dilute our book value per share.\nBecause we became public by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.\nAdditional risks to our investors may exist since we became public through a \u201creverse merger.\u201d Security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company since, because we became public through a reverse merger, there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. In addition, because of past abuses and fraud concerns stemming primarily from a lack of public information about newly public businesses, there are many people in the securities industry and business in general who view reverse merger transactions with suspicion. Without brokerage firm and analyst coverage, there may be fewer people aware of us and our business, resulting in fewer potential buyers of our common stock, less liquidity, and lower stock prices for our investors than would be the case if we had become a public reporting company in a more traditional manner.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our consolidated financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of exemptions from certain reporting requirements available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d under that Act, including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley (relating to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and any proxy statements we may be required to file, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies.\nWe have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d Consequently, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In this regard, we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after the first sale of our common equity securities under an effective registration statement. However, we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000 as of any June 30 in which case we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of December 31 of such year, (ii) if our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion in any fiscal year or (iii) if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions. If investors were to find our securities less attractive as a result of our election, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Tax Matters\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations and our ability to generate future taxable income.\nOn December 31, 2016, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of $30.1 million, which will begin to expire in 2032, and net operating loss carry forwards for state income tax purposes of $15.7 million, the expiration period of such net operating loss carry forwards varies by state. Due to the possibility that we will not be able to realize some portion of our NOLs, we carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax asset.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. If our existing NOLs are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes or future ownerships changes, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Code Section 382 and thereby result in the expiration of our NOLs or otherwise cause our NOLs to be unavailable to offset future taxable income.\nIn addition, the realization of these net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income before their expiration.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe do not collect sales, use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements to collect may adversely affect our financial results. State, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to our solutions in various jurisdictions may differ from our current position. Further, these jurisdictions\u2019 rules regarding tax nexus and the applicability of these taxes to our solutions are complex and vary significantly. As a result, we could face the possibility of tax audits and assessments, and our liability for these taxes and associated interest and penalties could exceed our original estimates. A successful assertion that we should be collecting or accruing sales, use, value-added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we are not currently doing so, could result in substantial tax liabilities and associated interest and penalties, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nTax provision changes, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for services, licenses and funding. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our tax policies and practices and assess additional taxes. In addition, tax authorities could review our transactions or tax returns and assert, in addition to the above, various withholding requirements apply to us or that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. In addition, proposals for tax legislation including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, if adopted, could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and sales taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by our earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nAn investment in our common stock is extremely speculative and there can be no assurance of any return on any such investment.\nAn investment in our common stock is extremely speculative and there is no assurance that investors will obtain any return on their investment. Investors will be subject to substantial risks involved in an investment in our company, including the risk of losing their entire investment.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations.\nEven though we have our common stock quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace, a consistently active trading market for our common stock has not and may not develop. Our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the current market price if trading in our stock is not active. Our stockholders may lose all or a part of their investment. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors and risks, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the risks noted elsewhere in this report, some of the other factors affecting our stock price may include:\n\u25cf variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf the level and quality of securities analysts\u2019 coverage of our common stock;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf announcements by third-parties of significant claims or proceedings against us; and\n\u25cf future sales of our common stock.\nFor these reasons, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our stockholders should not rely on past results as an indication of future performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the public company. Regardless of its outcome, this type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and a likely diversion of our management\u2019s attention. Our stockholders may not receive a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares and our stockholders may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nWe have a significant number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of certain outstanding debt obligations and convertible preferred stock, and the issuance of such shares upon conversion will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were 1,031,454 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase a total of 4,681,374 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we also had convertible notes outstanding, which at that point were convertible into 1,443,509 shares of common stock. Upon consummation of a public offering of securities in excess of $10.0 million, the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and certain of convertible notes outstanding will automatically convert into common stock, immediately diluting our stockholders investment in us. Upon consummation of a listing on an exchange owned by the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC, certain of the convertible notes outstanding will be convertible, at our option, into shares of our common stock at either the lower of $5.55 per share and 80% of the per share price in our next underwritten public offering or the lower of $7.00 per share and 80% of the per share price in our next underwritten public offering, as outlined in each individual agreement. We also have convertible notes that are convertible at the option of the holder at the lower of $5.55 per share and 80% of the per share price in our next underwritten public offering or the lower of $7.00 per share and 80% of the per share price in our next underwritten public offering, as outlined in each individual agreement. If the offering price in our next underwritten public offering is less than $5.55 per share, convertible notes will be converted into shares of our common stock at a discount, which could further dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 interests.\nWe are required to register under the Securities Act the resale of shares of our common stock by a number of our securityholders. Our failure to comply with our contractual obligations and timely register the resale of any shares of our common stock will result in, among other things, the payment of liquidated damages, including in the form of issuances of securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds through private placements in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have entered into various agreements with purchasers of our securities from time to time which require us to register under the Securities Act the resale of shares of our common stock that we have issued or will be required to issue to such purchasers. Our failure to comply with our contractual obligations and timely register the resale of any shares of our common stock for any reason will result in a breach of the agreements with certain securityholders and in the payment of liquidated damages, including issuances of securities, as required under the terms of our agreements with certain securityholders. Any issuance of securities to these purchasers will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. In addition, our failure to timely register the resale of any shares of our common stock will result in reputational harm for our company and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds through private placements in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, employees or significant stockholders, or when there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale. As of December 31, 2016, there were 3,155,088 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us from time to time should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nStockholders should not anticipate receiving cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nShares of our common stock that we have issued directly or that have been or may be acquired upon exercise of warrants or the conversion of convertible securities are or may be covered by registration statements which permit the public sale of stock. Other holders of shares of common stock that we have issued, including shares issuable upon exchange or conversion of our common stock, may be entitled to dispose of their shares pursuant to (i) the applicable holding period, volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 or (ii) another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Additional sales of a substantial number of our shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur executive officers and directors possess controlling voting power with respect to our common stock, which will limit your influence on corporate matters.\nOur directors and executive officers collectively beneficially owned approximately 50.83% of our voting stock as of February 13, 2017. As a result, our insiders have the ability to effectively control our management and affairs through the election and removal of our Board of Directors and all other matters requiring stockholder approval, including any future merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change-of-control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Furthermore, this concentrated control will limit the practical effect of your influence over our business and affairs, through any stockholder vote or otherwise. Any of these effects could depress the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Potential Reverse Stock Split and the Listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market\nThe potential Reverse Stock Split, if effected, would provide additional authorized shares for issuance by our Board of Directors, which could be used to frustrate any change in control or takeover transaction.\nOn January 17, 2017, our Board of Directors approved for submission to a vote of our stockholders the grant of authority to the Board of Directors to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split. At a special meeting of our stockholders on February 9, 2017, our stockholders approved the proposal. If the Board of Directors effects the Reverse Stock Split, we would have additional authorized shares of common stock that the Board of Directors could issue in the future without stockholder approval. Such additional shares could be issued, among other purposes, in financing transactions or to resist or frustrate a third-party transaction that is favored by a majority of the independent stockholders. This could have an anti-takeover effect, in that additional shares could be issued, within the limits imposed by applicable law, in one or more transactions that could make a change in control or takeover of us more difficult.\nEven if effected, the Reverse Stock Split may not increase the price of our common stock sufficiently and we may not be able to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAs of February 13, 2017, the closing price for our common stock as reported on the OTCQB Marketplace was $4.15 per share. If the Board of Directors effects the Reverse Stock Split, we expect that the Reverse Stock Split would increase the market price of our common stock so that we would be able to meet the minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split of our common stock upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty, and the results of reverse stock splits by companies in similar circumstances have been varied. It is possible that the market price of our common stock following the Reverse Stock Split would not satisfy the applicable minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to meet the minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may be unable to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition to specific listing and maintenance standards, the Nasdaq Capital Market has broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities, which it could exercise with respect to the listing of our common stock.\nEven if our common stock achieves the minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that our Nasdaq listing application will be approved.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace under the symbol \u201cCAFN.\u201d Our common stock is currently not listed on any stock exchange and there is currently a very limited trading market for our common stock on the OTCQB Marketplace. We have applied to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCAFN,\u201d which listing we expect to occur upon consummation of our Offering. In order for our common stock to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we will need to satisfy certain qualitative and quantitative requirements, including having at least $5,000,000 of stockholders\u2019 equity. No assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy all the applicable listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and that our listing application will be approved. If our Nasdaq listing application is approved, our common stock will then cease to be traded on the OTCQB Marketplace.\nEven if our Nasdaq listing application is approved and our common stock is initially listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nEven if our Nasdaq initial listing application is approved and our common stock is initially listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the qualitative and quantitative continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. For example, the market price of our common stock may not remain at the level required for continuing compliance with Nasdaq requirement in the future. Further, it is not uncommon for the market price of a company\u2019s common stock to decline in the period following a reverse stock split. If the Board of Directors effects the Reverse Stock Split, and the market price of our common stock declines in the period after the Reverse Stock Split, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split. Our failure to meet these requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThe potential Reverse Stock Split could decrease the liquidity of our stock.\nIf effected, the Reverse Stock Split could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock given the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, the Reverse Stock Split could increase the number of stockholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales.\nEven after the potential Reverse Stock Split, the trading price of our common stock may not be high enough to attract new investors, including institutional investors, and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve.\nEven if the Board of Directors effects the Reverse Stock Split, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split would result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors, or that the share price will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve and our share price may decline.", "PERMNO": 16629, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "DGLT"}
