{"cik": "1039828", "company": "AMERICAN EQUITY INVESTMENT LIFE HOLDING CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend on the accuracy of management assumptions and estimates. Significant deviations between estimated and actual results could lead to significant gains or losses and significant volatility in our net income.\nAssumptions and estimates are made regarding expenses, interest rates, investment returns, utilization rates of lifetime income benefit riders, surrender activity, tax liabilities, contingent liabilities and other factors related to our business and anticipated results. We rely on these assumptions and estimates when making decisions that are critical to our business operations, including products and pricing decisions, calculation of key account balances included in the financial statements and determining the amount of regulatory and rating agency capital to hold. All assumptions and estimates utilized incorporate many factors, none of which can be predicted with certainty. To the extent our actual experience and changes in estimates differ from original estimates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be materially and adversely affected.\nProducts and Pricing - The expected profitability of our annuity products is based in part upon expected patterns of expenses and benefits using a number of assumptions, including those related to the probability that a policy will remain in force, or persistency, and mortality. Since no insurer can precisely determine persistency or mortality, actual results could differ significantly from assumptions, and deviations from estimates and assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, actual persistency that is lower than our assumptions could have an adverse impact on future profitability, especially in the early years of a policy primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy.\nIn addition, we set initial crediting rates for our annuity products based upon expected benefit payments using assumptions for, among other factors, mortality rates of our policyholders. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. For example, if mortality rates are lower than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make more payments under certain annuity contracts than what we had projected.\nFinancial Statements - Account balances reported in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations are affected by the use of estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to policyholder benefit reserves, derivative and embedded derivative balances, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements, the fair value of investments and valuation allowances. The calculations we use to estimate these balances are often complex and involve analyzing and interpreting large quantities of data. The assumptions and estimates required for these calculations involve judgment and by their nature are imprecise and subject to changes and revisions over time. Accordingly, our results may be adversely affected from time to time by actual results differing from assumptions, by changes in estimates and by changes resulting from implementing more sophisticated valuation systems and procedures that facilitate the calculation of more precise estimates. Specific examples of estimates and assumptions used in account balances follows:\n\u2022In determining the liability from period to period of our lifetime income benefit riders, we must make significant assumptions such as expected index credits, the age when a policyholder may begin to utilize the rider and the number of policyholders that may not utilize the rider at all. Changes in these assumptions can be significant. Accordingly, our results of operations could be adversely affected from time to time by actual index credits being different than expected, actual policyholder behavior varying from what we have assumed in determining the liability associated with these riders and by changes in estimates based on this policyholder behavior.\n\u2022The calculation of our fixed index annuities embedded derivative liability requires us to make significant assumptions including the discount rates used to discount the excess projected contract values, the expected cost of annual call options we will purchase in the future to fund index credits beyond the next policy anniversary date and our best estimate for future policy decrements specific to lapse rates. As changes in the value of these embedded derivatives are recorded as a component of our expenses, changes in these assumptions can result in significant volatility in our reported net income and book value per share\n\u2022Deferred policy acquisition costs are costs that vary with and primarily relate to the successful acquisition of new business. Deferred sales inducements are contract enhancements such as first-year premium and interest bonuses that are credited to policyholder account balances. These costs are capitalized when incurred and are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. Current amortization of these costs is generally in proportion to estimated gross profits from interest margins and, to a lesser extent,\nfrom surrender charges and rider fees. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, mortality or withdrawals may cause acceleration of the amortization of these costs resulting in an increase in expenses and lower profitability.\n\u2022Fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. During periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. Prices provided by independent pricing services or independent broker quotes that are used in the determination of fair value can vary significantly for a particular security. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater judgment as well as valuation methods that require greater judgment. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit conditions could negatively impact the valuation of securities as reported in our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n\u2022Call options purchased to fund index credits on our fixed index annuity products are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets and are based upon the amount of cash that would be required to settle the call options adjusted for the nonperformance risk of the counterparty. During periods of financial market volatility, fair value of such options can fluctuate significantly which can cause substantial volatility in our reported net income.\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in interest rates could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the following respects:\n\u2022Substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can adversely affect our investment spread, or the difference between yields on our invested assets and our cost of money, and impact our ability to earn predictable returns.\n\u2022Changes in interest rates could negatively impact the fair value of our investments and the reported value of stockholders' equity. A rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will decrease the unrealized gain position (or increase the unrealized loss position) of our investment portfolio. With respect to our available for sale fixed maturity securities, declines in value (net of income taxes and certain adjustments for assumed changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements) reduce our reported stockholders' equity and book value per share.\n\u2022Sustained declines in interest rates may cause us to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments into lower-yielding investments to achieve the credit quality we desire, or cause us to invest into investments with less liquidity or lower credit quality to achieve the comparable returns. We have a certain ability to mitigate this risk by lowering crediting rates on our products subject to certain restrictions.\n\u2022Sustained periods of low interest rates may have a negative impact on our ability to sell our fixed index annuities as consumers look for other financial instruments with potentially higher returns to fund retirement. In times of low interest rates, such as we have been experiencing and which we may continue to experience in future periods, it is difficult to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability, which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products.\n\u2022Periods of rising interest rates may expose us to disintermediation risk which is the risk that policyholders surrender all or part of their contracts in a rising interest rate environment and may lead to net cash outflows and the resulting liquidity demands may require us to sell assets in an unrealized loss position. Further, a portion of our investment portfolio consists of privately placed securities, below investment grade securities, structured securities and mortgage loans, which are relatively illiquid, thus increasing our liquidity risk in the event of disintermediation. We may also be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements related to surrendered contracts, which would adversely affect our results of operations. During such times, we may offer higher crediting rates on new sales of annuity products and increase crediting rates on existing annuity products to maintain or enhance product competitiveness. We may not be able to purchase enough higher yielding assets necessary to fund higher crediting rates and maintain our desired spread, which could result in lower profitability on our business. Alternatively, if we seek to maintain profitability of our products in rising interest rate environments it may be difficult to position our products to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products.\n\u2022Sustained declines in long-term interest rates may result in increased redemptions of our fixed maturity securities that are subject to call redemption prior to maturity by the issuer or prepayments of mortgage loans and expose us to reinvestment risk. If we are unable to reinvest the proceeds from such redemptions into investments with the credit quality and yield characteristics of the redeemed or prepaid investments, our net income and overall financial performance may be adversely affected. We have a certain ability to mitigate this risk by lowering crediting rates on our products subject to certain restrictions.\nOur investments are subject to market, credit, liquidity and concentration risks, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur investments, including our derivative financial instruments, are subject to the risks of credit defaults and market value volatility. These risks could increase when financial and credit markets are disrupted or subject to extreme volatility, potentially resulting in credit losses on assets in our investment portfolio. We are also subject to the risk that cash flows generated from the collateral underlying our structured products may differ from our expectations in timing or amount.\nOur cash flows and results of operations could also be negatively impacted by significant changes to credit spreads. Significant widening of credit spreads could result in greater investment income on new investments but would also indicate growing concern about the ability of credit issuers to service their debt which could result in additional credit losses whereas if credit spreads tighten significantly it could result in reduced net investment income from new purchases of investments or funding of mortgage loans.\nIf we fail to react appropriately to difficult market conditions, our investment portfolio could incur material losses, which could harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.\nWe attempt to minimize the adverse impact of this risk by monitoring portfolio diversification and exposure by asset class, creditor, industry, and by complying with investment limitations governed by state insurance laws and regulations as applicable. We also consider all relevant objective information available in estimating the cash flows related to residential and commercial mortgage backed securities.\nMany of our investments are in securities that are not publicly traded or that otherwise lack liquidity, such as privately placed fixed maturity securities, below investment grade securities, investments in mortgage loans and alternative investments. Many of our investments that pose potential liquidity risk are recorded at fair value. If required to sell these investments, we may be forced to sell them at below fair market values and could incur significant losses. Therefore, it may be difficult or costly for us to liquidate positions quickly in order to meet unexpected withdrawal obligations.\nWhile we maintain a diversified portfolio, including diversification related to asset classes and financial sectors, we still have significant concentration of investments in certain asset classes and financial sectors that could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to the extent an asset class or financial sector experiences strain.\nDefaults on mortgage loans and volatility in performance may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMortgage loans have the potential to face heightened delinquency and default risk depending on economic conditions which could have a negative impact on the performance of the underlying collateral, resulting in declining values and an adverse impact on the obligors of such instruments. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the carrying value of mortgage loans is negatively impacted by such factors. The carrying value of our mortgage loans is stated as outstanding principal adjusted for net deferred fees and costs and unamortized discounts and premiums, less any loan loss allowances recognized. Considerations in determining allowances include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) declining debt service coverage ratios and increasing loan to value ratios; (ii) loan performance, including delinquency rates; (iii) bankruptcy filings of the borrower or major tenants or affiliates of the borrower on the property; (iv) catastrophic events at the property; (v) probability of default and recovery rate assumptions on our residential and agricultural loan portfolios; and (vi) other subjective events or factors, including economic outlook, and whether the terms of the debt will be restructured. There can be no assurance that management's assessment of loan loss allowances on mortgage loans will not change in future periods, which could lead to investment losses.\nVolatility in the equity market and/or interest rates could increase the cost of options purchased to fund annual index credits and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe manage the index-based risk component of our fixed index annuities by purchasing call options on the applicable indices to fund the annual index credits on these annuities and by adjusting the caps, participation rates and asset fees on policy anniversary dates to reflect changes in the cost of such options which varies based on market conditions. The price of certain options generally increases with higher volatility in equity markets and the cost of options generally increases with higher interest rates. Thus, the volatility of the cost of the options adds an additional degree of uncertainty to the profitability of fixed index products. We attempt to mitigate this risk by resetting caps, participation rates and asset fees annually on policy anniversaries.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties, including companies with whom we have reinsurance agreements or have purchased call options.\nWe cede material amounts of insurance to other insurance companies through reinsurance, and therefore we bear credit risk with respect to these reinsurers. American Equity Life has three coinsurance agreements with Athene covering $4.4 billion of policy benefit reserves at December 31, 2020 and two coinsurance agreements with EquiTrust covering $0.4 billion of policy benefit reserves at December 31, 2020. Since Athene is an unauthorized reinsurer, the annuity deposits ceded to Athene are secured by assets held in trusts and American Equity Life is the sole beneficiary of the trusts. The assets in the trusts are required to remain at a value that is sufficient to support the current balance of policy benefit reserves of the ceded business on a statutory basis. If the value of the assets in the trusts would ever be less than the amount of the ceded policy benefit reserves on a statutory basis, Athene is required to either establish a letter of credit or deposit securities in the trusts\nfor the amount of any shortfall. The annuity deposits ceded to Equitrust are not secured and in the event of an insolvency of Equitrust acting as a reinsurer, our claims would be subordinated to those of Equitrust's policyholders. We remain liable with respect to the policy liabilities ceded to EquiTrust and Athene should either fail to meet the obligations assumed by them.\nIn addition, we have entered into other types of reinsurance contracts including financing arrangements. Should any of these reinsurers fail to meet the obligations assumed under such contracts, we remain liable with respect to the statutory liabilities ceded. If American Equity Life was forced to recapture any significant blocks of business ceded as a result of a reinsurer being unable or unwilling to perform under the applicable agreement, it may face a shortfall in capital to support the recaptured business resulting in a potential decline in its RBC ratio, exposure to a ratings downgrade or other negative effects.\nNo assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to accept an increase in our net liability exposure or a decrease in our statutory surplus, reduce the amount of business we write or develop other alternatives to reinsurance. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance, the decrease in statutory surplus of American Equity Life could be material to its capital position which may result in a potential decline in its RBC ratio, exposure to a ratings downgrade or other negative effects.\nWe are also exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on call options. We purchase such options from a number of counterparties to fund the index credits on our fixed index annuities. Our policy is to acquire call options only from counterparties rated \"A-\"or better by a nationally recognized rating agency and the maximum credit exposure to any single counterparty is subject to concentration limits. In addition, we have entered into credit support agreements with our counterparties which allow us to require our counterparties to post collateral to secure their obligations to us under the derivative instruments. If our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, our revenues may not be sufficient to fund the index credits on our fixed index annuities. Any such failure could harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.\nWe utilize and rely on third parties to perform various services for the Company. Failure of these third parties to meet our service level objectives or abide by regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe utilize third parties to perform various services for the Company. While we have controls in place to monitor the activities performed by these third parties with respect to service level performance and compliance with internal and regulatory rules, regulations and standards, we still have a dependency on them to execute in accordance with service level requirements and to understand and abide by internal and regulatory rules, regulations and standards.\nWe face competition from companies that have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products and higher ratings, which may limit our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and enjoy substantially greater financial resources, higher ratings by rating agencies, broader and more diversified product lines and more widespread agency relationships. Our annuity products compete with fixed index, fixed rate and variable annuities sold by other insurance companies and also with mutual fund products, traditional bank products and other retirement funding alternatives offered by asset managers, banks and broker/dealers. Our insurance products compete with those of other insurance companies, financial intermediaries and other institutions based on a number of factors, including caps, participation rates and crediting rates, policy terms and conditions, service provided to distributors and policyholders, ratings by rating agencies, reputation and distributor compensation.\nOur ability to compete depends in part on returns and other benefits we make available to our policyholders through our annuity contracts. We will not be able to offer competitive products if we are unable to invest in assets with attractive and/or competitive yields and thus our investment results underperform the market or the competition, since such underperformance likely would result in lower rates to policyholders which could lead to withdrawals and reduced sales.\nWe compete for distribution sources for our products. We believe that our success in competing for distributors depends on our financial strength, the services we provide to and the relationships we develop with these distributors, as well as offering competitive commission structures. Our distributors are generally free to sell products from whichever providers they wish, which makes it important for us to continually offer distributors products and services they find attractive. If our products or services fall short of distributors' needs, we may not be able to establish and maintain satisfactory relationships with distributors of our products. Our ability to compete in the past has also depended in part on our ability to develop innovative new products. In order for us to compete in the future, we will need to continue to bring innovative products to market in a timely fashion. Otherwise, our revenues and profitability could suffer.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain independent marketing organizations, independent agents, broker/dealers, banks and registered investment advisors, sales of our products may be adversely affected.\nWe must attract and retain marketing organizations and distributors, including agents to sell our products. Insurance companies compete vigorously for productive agents. We compete with other life insurance companies for marketers and agents primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. Such marketers and agents may promote products offered by other life insurance companies that may offer a larger variety of products than we do. Our competitiveness for such marketers and agents also depends upon the long-term relationships we develop with them. We are developing a network of broker/dealers, banks and registered\ninvestment advisors to distribute our products. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient marketers, agents, broker/dealers, banks and registered investment advisors to sell our products, our ability to compete and our sales would suffer.\nOur operations support complex transactions and are highly dependent on the proper functioning of information technology and communication systems. Any failure or security breach of our information technology or communications systems could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to access our information technology (IT) systems to perform necessary business functions such as providing customer support, maintaining existing policies, paying claims, managing our investment portfolios, and producing financial statements.\nWhile systems and processes are designed to support complex transactions and avoid negative outcomes such as systems failures, fraud, processing errors and regulatory breaches, any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We must also commit significant resources to maintain and enhance our existing systems to keep pace with industry standards and evolving customer preferences. If we fail to keep up-to-date information systems, we may not be able to rely on information for product design, product pricing and risk management decisions.\nDespite the existence of extensive backup and recovery systems and contingency plans, we cannot guarantee investors that system interruptions or similar IT failures will not occur, or if they do occur, that they can be remediated promptly. All IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions resulting from natural or man-made disasters, acts of terrorism or civil disobedience, pandemics or other events beyond an organization\u2019s control. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We retain confidential information within our IT infrastructure, and we rely on both a complex information security controls framework that leverages multiple leading industry control standards, as well as extensive commercial control technologies to maintain the security of those systems. Any attacker that is able to circumvent our comprehensive information security controls infrastructure could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete any information contained within the accessed systems, including personally identifiable policyholder information and proprietary business information.\nThe NAIC has adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law which established the standards for data security, investigation, and notification of a breach of data security for insurance companies. An increasing number of state insurance regulatory agencies have adopted a version of the NAIC\u2019s model regulation and now require that affected persons be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personally identifiable information. Any compromise of the cybersecurity of our computer systems that results in the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.\nA downgrade in our credit or financial strength ratings may increase our cost of capital, reduce new sales, adversely affect relationships with distributors and increase policy surrenders and withdrawals.\nFinancial strength ratings issued by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (\"NRSRO's\") are measures of an insurance company's ability to meet policyholder obligations and generally involve quantitative and qualitative evaluations by rating agencies of a company's financial condition and operating performance. Ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, policyholders and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. Factors that could negatively influence financial strength ratings include:\n\u2022Sustained reductions in new sales of insurance products;\n\u2022Unfavorable operational and/or financial trends;\n\u2022Significant losses and/or ratings deterioration in our investment portfolio;\n\u2022Changes in equity market levels, interest rates, and market volatility;\n\u2022Inability to access capital markets to provide reserve relief;\n\u2022Changes in statutory accounting or reserve requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022Inability to sustain senior management or other key personnel;\n\u2022Rapid or excessive growth; and\n\u2022Ineffective enterprise risk management.\nOur ability to maintain such ratings is dependent upon the results of operations of our subsidiaries and our financial strength. If we fail to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and/or maintain or strengthen our current capital position, it could result in a downgrade of the ratings applicable to our senior unsecured indebtedness. A downgrade would likely reduce the fair value of our common and preferred stock and may increase our cost of capital.\nFinancial strength ratings are important factors used by distributors and sales agents in determining which insurer's annuities to market. In recent years, the market for annuities has been dominated by those insurers with the highest ratings. A ratings downgrade, or the potential for a ratings downgrade, could have a number of adverse effects on our business. For example, a ratings downgrade could cause distributors and sales agents to seek alternative carriers. In addition, a ratings downgrade could increase the number of policy or contract surrenders we experience, as well as our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance.\nWe may require additional capital to support our business and sustain future growth which may not be available when needed or may be available only on unfavorable terms.\nOur long-term capital adequacy will depend on many factors including the accumulated statutory earnings of our life insurance subsidiaries and the relationship between the statutory capital and surplus of our life insurance subsidiaries and various elements of required capital. For the purpose of supporting long-term capital requirements, we may need to increase or maintain the statutory capital and surplus of our life insurance subsidiaries through additional financings, which could include debt, equity, and/or other surplus relief transactions. Adverse market conditions could affect the availability and cost of capital. Such financings, if available at all, may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot maintain adequate capital, we may be required to limit growth in sales of new annuity products, and such action could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConditions in the U.S. and global capital markets and economies could deteriorate in the near future and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is affected by conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets and economies. Future economic downturn or market disruption could negatively impact our ability to invest funds. Specifically, if market conditions deteriorate in 2021 or beyond:\n\u2022our investment portfolio could incur additional credit losses;\n\u2022our mortgage loans could experience a greater amount of loss;\n\u2022due to potential downgrades in our investment portfolio, we could be required to raise additional capital to sustain our current business in force and new sales of our annuity products, which may be difficult in a distressed market. If capital would be available, it may be at terms that are not favorable to us;\n\u2022we may be required to limit growth in sales of our annuity products; and/or\n\u2022our liquidity could be negatively affected and we could be forced to limit our operations and our business could suffer, as we need liquidity to pay our policyholder benefits, operating expenses, dividends on our capital stock, and to service our debt obligations.\nThe principal sources of our liquidity are annuity deposits, investment income and proceeds from the sale, maturity and call of investments. Sources of additional capital in normal markets include the issuance of short and long-term instruments, including equity, debt or other types of securities.\nMajor public health issues, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting economic uncertainty, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has created significant economic and financial turmoil both in the U.S. and around the world which has had a material effect on the global economy and financial markets and raised concerns of a global recession. At this time, it is not possible to estimate how long it will take to stop the spread of COVID-19 or the longer-term effects that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business. COVID-19 has caused significant economic effects where we operate, including closures of many businesses deemed non-essential due to shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, travel limitations and other governmental regulations. Though most of our employees are able to work remotely, these closures have caused disruption to the distribution channels through which we sell our products, including independent agents, and their clients. It is currently unclear how long such closures will last. The effects of such closures are dependent on the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such adverse impacts may be material.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 could have adverse impacts on economic activity that affects demand for annuities. Such events or conditions could have an adverse effect on sales of new policies. Increased unemployment resulting from the economic impacts of COVID-19 may also result in policyholders seeking sources of liquidity and withdrawing at rates greater than we previously expected. If policyholder lapse and surrender rates significantly exceed our expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe have implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken measures and other precautions to protect our employees. Currently, most of our employees are working remotely with only operationally critical employees working at our offices in West Des Moines, Iowa for business continuity purposes, to the extent lawfully permitted. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity, information technology and third-party service provider risks, and impair our ability to manage our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on financial markets may materially impact our investment portfolio, although the extent of such impact is currently unknown. Our investment portfolio contains fixed income investments, such as bonds, the fair value of which fluctuates depending on market and other general conditions. These investments are also interest rate sensitive and may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. The COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on financial markets could also impair our ability to access and efficiently use external capital resources. In the event that these conditions persist and result in a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, our results of operations, our financial condition and/or liquidity, could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe risks and impacts associated with COVID-19 described above are not the only ones that may affect our company. Other risks presented above, including risks related to credit, our reinsurance program, our use of derivatives, defaults on mortgage loans, changes in law or regulation, or downgrades in our credit or financial strength ratings, may be heightened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFailure to authorize and pay dividends on our preferred stock could adversely impact our business and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Dividends on the Series A and B Preferred Stock are not cumulative and are not mandatory.\nFailure to authorize and pay dividends regularly on our preferred stock could result in our inability to pay or declare a dividend on our common stock or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration any of our common stock, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nIf dividends are not declared on the Series A or B Preferred Stock for any dividend period, then any dividends for that dividend period shall not accrue and shall not be payable.\nWe are a holding company with limited operations of our own. As a consequence, our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other permissible payments to us, which may be restricted by law.\nWe, as the parent company, are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries, and have no business operations. We need liquidity primarily to service our debt (senior notes and subordinated debentures issued to a subsidiary trust), pay operating expenses and pay dividends to common and preferred stockholders. Our assets consist primarily of the capital stock and surplus notes of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends, surplus note interest payments and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our investment advisory agreements and tax allocation agreement with our subsidiaries. Iowa insurance law regulates the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year by American Equity Life and Eagle Life. Accordingly, our payment of dividends is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend or otherwise. If our subsidiaries cannot pay sufficient dividends or distributions to us in the future, we would be unable to meet our obligations or to pay dividends. This would negatively affect our business and financial condition as well as the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nOur business model relies on executing reinsurance and investment management agreements with affiliated and non-affiliated entities, some or all of which may require regulatory approval. Failure to receive regulatory approval, failure to receive regulatory approval in a timely manner or being unable to successfully execute our business strategies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the value of our common and preferred stock.\nAs part of the execution of AEL 2.0, we are entering into a number of third party reinsurance and investment management partnerships, all of which are at varying levels of execution and completion. It is possible, that despite good faith negotiations, we will not reach conclusive agreement with one or more third parties. In such cases, we may need to seek other partners or modify the business approach. There may be unforeseen delays in execution due to reliance on third parties. Regulatory approval of parts of our business plan is always uncertain, which could cause significant modifications or delays that inhibit the successful execution of our plans. Additionally, as part of Brookfield\u2019s intended equity investment in the company, its investment is subject to several regulatory approvals. These approvals may delay or impact the execution of the Brookfield equity investment and the related reinsurance strategy between the company and Brookfield and its affiliates.\nRisks Relating to Insurance and Regulatory Matters\nWe face risks relating to litigation and regulatory examination, including the costs of such litigation or examination, management distraction and the potential for damage awards, fines, penalties or other required remediation, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are occasionally involved in litigation, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff. Companies in the life insurance and annuity business have faced litigation, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper product design, improper sales practices and similar claims. In addition, state regulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC and the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\").\nChanges in laws and regulations applicable to our business may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to regulation under applicable insurance statutes, including insurance holding company statutes, in the various states in which our life insurance subsidiaries transact business. Our life insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Iowa and New York. We are currently licensed to sell our products in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Insurance regulation is intended to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect shareholders of insurance companies or their holding companies. As increased scrutiny has been placed upon the insurance regulatory framework, a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative proposals that alter, and in many cases increase, state authority to regulate insurance companies and holding company systems.\nRegulators oversee matters relating to trade practices, policy forms, claims practices, guaranty funds, types and amounts of investments, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, minimum amounts of capital and surplus, transactions with related parties, changes in control and payment of dividends.\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations. The NAIC may develop and recommend adoption of new or modify existing Model Laws and Regulations. State insurance regulators may impose those recommended changes, or others, in the future. The NAIC has adopted best interest enhancements to the existing Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Law. Several states have adopted the best interest standard with effective dates in 2021. Additional states are expected to adopt the best interest standard in the near future. Some states may adopt a heightened fiduciary standard of conduct.\nOur life insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance regulations based on the NAIC's risk-based capital requirements which are intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify deteriorating or weakly capitalized insurance companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. The NAIC has the authority and ability to update statutory capital requirements which could increase the cost of capital and negatively impact our business. Our life insurance subsidiaries also may be required, under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business, to pay assessments up to certain prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities for insolvent insurance companies.\nAlthough the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including financial services regulation, securities regulation, federal taxation and employment matters, can significantly affect the insurance business. Heightened standards of conduct as a result of a fiduciary or best interest standard or other similar rules or regulations could increase the compliance and regulatory burdens on our sales representatives. On February 16, 2021, the DOL's new fiduciary regulation and interpretative guidance regarding the provision of investment advice in retirement accounts became effective. The DOL's final guidance confirms the restatement of the definition of \"investment advice\" that previously applied but broadens the circumstances under which sales representatives could be considered fiduciaries under ERISA in connection with recommendations to \"rollover\" assets from a qualified retirement plan to an individual retirement account. This guidance reverses an earlier DOL interpretation suggesting that \"rollover\" advice did not constitute investment advice giving rise to a fiduciary relationship. We are reviewing the DOL's final guidance to determine how it might apply to our business. In addition, legislation has been enacted which could result in the federal government assuming some role in the regulation of the insurance industry.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal information. These laws vary by jurisdiction. Recent regulations with a significant impact on our operations include the New York Department of Financial Services Part 500 cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies and the California Consumer Privacy Act. The New York Department of Financial Services Part 500 cybersecurity requirements became effective January 1, 2017 and focus on minimum standards for cybersecurity programs. The California Consumer Privacy Act became effective January 1, 2020 and contains protections for individuals, including but not limited to notification requirements for data breaches, the right to access personal data and the right to be forgotten. It applies to companies doing business in California. Similar standards are set forth in the NAIC\u2019s Insurance Data Security Model Law. It is anticipated that additional federal and state regulations will be enacted in the future. Changes in cybersecurity and privacy regulations or the enactment of new regulations may increase our compliance costs and failure to comply with these regulations may lead to reputational damage, fines or civil damages, and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nChanges in federal income taxation laws, including any reduction in individual income tax rates, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe annuity and life insurance products that we market generally provide the policyholder with certain federal income tax advantages. For example, federal income taxation on any increases in non-qualified annuity contract values (i.e., the \"inside build-up\") is deferred until it is received by the policyholder. With other savings instruments, such as certificates of deposit and taxable bonds, the increase in value is generally taxed each year as it is realized. Decreases in individual income tax rates would decrease the advantage of deferring the inside build-up.\nFrom time to time, various tax law changes have been proposed that could have an adverse effect on our business, including the elimination of all or a portion of the income tax advantages described above for annuities and life insurance. If legislation were enacted to eliminate all or a portion of the tax deferral for annuities or limited deferral within IRAs or required mandatory distributions from IRAs, such a change would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products.\nChanges in corporate tax rates and laws may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Biden administration has indicated an intent to raise corporate tax rates, impact offshoring transactions and reconsider whether tax obligations should be triggered by \u201cbook income\u201d instead of \u201ctaxable income\u201d. The requirements of any such regulations cannot be predicted at this time. An increase in corporate tax rates would increase our net deferred tax liability and increase our tax expense. Application of tax to \u201cbook income\u201d instead of \u201ctaxable income\u201d can require us to pay taxes sooner than would otherwise be necessary. Restrictions and tax changes that apply to liabilities administered or shifted offshore could negatively impact the value derived from various reinsurance transactions we have announced an intention to execute during 2021.", "PERMNO": 89946, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "AEL"}
