{"cik": "1487986", "company": "Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur business faces a variety of financial, operating and market risks, including the following:\nFailures in our critical back-office systems and IT infrastructure or a breach of our data security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe operate our own back-office and IT infrastructure, including business processes, software applications (such as billing systems, corporate finance systems, human resources and payroll systems and customer relationship management systems), and hardware that are vital to our operations. Failures in our back-office systems and IT infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to cyber and other data security risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by us in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that supports our communications network and other business processes. This risk may be heightened as we expand our managed services, data center services, and cloud-based services. We seek to detect and to prevent all security breaches, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effect. Significant security failures could result in the theft, loss, damage, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information; the theft, loss, damage, unauthorized use or publication of our customers' personally identifiable information, intellectual property and/or confidential business information; or the unauthorized use or disabling of our network elements. While we have technology and information security processes and disaster recovery data breach plans in place to mitigate these risks and respond to any incidents, there is no assurance these measures will be adequate. A loss of confidential or proprietary data or other data security breaches could materially and adversely affect our customers, employees and vendors, damage our reputation among customers and the public, disrupt operations, and subject us to possible financial losses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations and our ability to expand our services.\nA network disruption could cause delays or interruptions of service, which could cause us to lose customers.\nTo be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable and uninterrupted service over our expanded network. Disruptions in our service could occur as a result of events that are beyond our control. Some of the risks to our network and infrastructure include, without limitation:\n\u2022 physical damage to our transmission network including poles, cable and access lines;\n\u2022 widespread power surges or outages;\n\u2022 software defects in critical systems; and\n\u2022 damage intentionally or unintentionally inflicted by third parties upon the network or our other infrastructure.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we have experienced and in the future may experience short disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, inclement weather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. In addition, certain portions of our network may lack adequate redundancy to allow for expedient recovery of service to affected customers. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and incur expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make material capital expenditures in connection with improvements to our network and other facilities. Unforeseen increases in the amount of capital expenditures required to execute our current business plan could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make a significant amount of capital expenditures to, among other things, enhance the capabilities of our network, enhance the functionality of our existing IT systems, and support the deployment of new products and services. We intend to fund these capital expenditures and expenses with operating cash flows and funds available to us under our credit facilities. Increases in the amount of capital expenditures and expenses required to upgrade our network and other facilities above those contemplated by our current business plan, could cause our cash flows and available financing to be insufficient to fund such capital expenditures and operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe rely on several material outsourcing agreements to operate our business. The loss of certain of these agreements, or the failure of any third party to perform under certain of these agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nSeveral critical services necessary to operate our business are provided by third-party service providers. For example, we have entered into agreements with Accenture and other third parties for the provision of, among other things, critical printing, billing, and IT services.\nUpon expiration or termination of these agreements, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, favorable to us, or at all. The failure of these third-party service providers to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us, without a suitable replacement, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if these third-party service providers were to seek U.S. bankruptcy law protection, our agreements with such service providers, and such service providers' ability to provide the services under those agreements, could be adversely impacted, and although we may have a claim for damages against the bankruptcy estate, the claim may or may not be paid in the bankruptcy proceeding.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental regulation. Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry, and most of our revenues come from the provision of services regulated by the FCC and the HPUC. Laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be changed by federal or state legislative initiative, judicial review or regulatory agencies at any time. We cannot predict the impact of future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes would have on us.\nThe \"Connect America Fund\" Order adopted by the FCC in November 2011 comprehensively reformed both the universal service program and intercarrier compensation and has had a significant impact on us. See \"-Universal Service\" above for a discussion of the impact of the Order on the universal service program, and \"-Federal Framework for Intercarrier Compensation\" above for a discussion on the impact of the Order on intercarrier compensation. Changes in other FCC policies under review also could have a significant impact on us by increasing our obligations and/or reducing our revenue.\nIn February 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband service, both fixed and mobile, from its longstanding status as a Title I information service to a Title II common carrier telecommunications service. Although it is too early to determine with any certainty how the order will affect our broadband services, the order could result in additional costs and reduced margins in our broadband business. See \"Federal Regulatory Classification of Broadband and Internet Services\".\nState government regulation also is a source of business uncertainty. We cannot predict whether state proceedings will be initiated or the possible outcome of such proceedings at this time.\nA reduction by the HPUC or the FCC of the rates we charge our customers would reduce our revenues and could reduce our earnings.\nThe rates we charge our local telephone customers are based, in part, on a rate-of-return authorized by the HPUC on capital invested in our network. These authorized rates, as well as allowable investment and expenses, are subject to review and change by the HPUC at any time. If the HPUC orders us to reduce our rates, our revenues would be reduced and our earnings also could be reduced absent corresponding reductions in costs or offsetting revenue increases in other segments. We cannot assure you that our rates will remain at their current levels. The HPUC order received in connection with the 2007 sale of our directories publishing business imposed a condition requiring the imputation of revenues. Specifically, a directory publishing revenue credit in the annual amount of $42.6 million per year must be added as regulated revenues into the calculation of Hawaiian Telcom, Inc.'s earnings from 2008 to 2022 in all future rate cases, alternative form of regulation proceedings, or other proceedings before the HPUC investigating Hawaiian Telcom, Inc.'s earnings or financial performance. This condition may adversely affect our ability to obtain rate increases in the future.\nAlso, our local exchange service competitors may gain a competitive advantage based on rules which favor competitors. For example, competitors have the ability to purchase our services at discounted rates set by the HPUC and to resell them at rates that are not subject to the level of regulatory scrutiny generally faced by us. Additionally, as a result of the state regulators permitting our competitors to intervene in rate-setting proceedings, there is a potential that such competitors could obtain business sensitive information about us during such proceedings.\nThe FCC approves tariffs for interstate access and subscriber line charges, both of which are components of our network access revenue. The FCC currently is considering whether to restrain special access pricing by carriers like us subject to price caps on interstate rates. The \"Connect America Fund\" Order that the FCC adopted in November 2011 reduces switched interstate access charges for carriers like us over a period of six years but allows us to recover some of the foregone revenue from our end users. It is possible we may be required to recover more revenue through subscriber line charges or forego this revenue altogether. This could reduce our revenue or impair our competitive position.\nThe telecommunications industry is increasingly competitive, and we may have difficulty competing effectively.\nAll sectors of the telecommunications industry are competitive. Competition in the markets in which we operate could, among other things:\n\u2022 reduce our customer base;\n\u2022 require us to lower prices charged customers in order to compete; or\n\u2022 require us to increase marketing expenditures and the use of discounting and promotional campaigns.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nAdditionally, the pending merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest cable TV providers in the United States, could result in an increase in Oceanic's already aggressive competition in the Hawaii market for both video services and broadband internet access services.\nWireline Services. As the ILEC, we face competition from resellers, local providers who lease UNEs from us, from facilities-based providers of local telephone services, and from providers of VoIP services.\nWe have historically faced access line losses as a result of competition and substitution of traditional wireline services with wireless services. Access line losses have been faced by the industry as a whole, and we cannot assure you that access line losses will not continue in the future. In particular, the increasing penetration of high-speed Internet and VoIP could lead to further primary and secondary access line losses.\nInterconnection duties are governed, in part, by telecommunications rules and regulations related to the UNEs that must be provided. These rules and regulations remain subject to ongoing modifications. Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business. However, we received some regulatory relief in 2009 when the Hawaii State Legislature passed Act 180, which classified retail local exchange intrastate services as fully competitive. While HPUC approval and cost support filings are no longer required to establish or modify rates or to bundle service offerings, HPUC approval is required to raise the rate that existed for the retail service in the tariff at the time of implementation of Act 180. In addition, while cellular wireless services initially complemented traditional local exchange and long distance services, existing and emerging wireless and IP technologies are increasingly competitive with local exchange and, particularly, long distance services in some or all of our service areas.\nInternet Services. We expect that the Internet access services business will continue to be highly competitive due to the absence of significant barriers to entry. We currently compete with a number of established online services companies, inter-exchange carriers and cable companies. Competition is particularly intense for broadband services.\nManaged Services. We face numerous competitors that vary based on the type of managed services being offered. Other network service providers provide some form of managed network service monitoring capability. Numerous voice and data equipment vendors provide management of the installed equipment either at an individual location or across multiple networked locations. Competitive managed IP and network security services are offered by various firms that specialize in this area.\nData Center and Cloud-Based Services. There currently is a limited inventory of colocation data center space available in Hawaii. However, there are numerous other providers of cloud-based software, including system integrators in Hawaii and web-based service providers, that offer software subscriptions and virtual machines on cloud-based servers housed in data centers on the U.S. mainland and internationally.\nAdvanced Communications and Network Services. These advanced services businesses are highly competitive. Many non-traditional players have emerged in the business communications market, attracted by the absence of significant barriers to entry. Many of these non-traditional players are capable of focusing on highly specialized areas of the market.\nNext-Generation Television Service. We launched our television service on the island of Oahu in July 2011. The market for television services in Hawaii is dominated by Oceanic. On the island of Oahu, approximately 73% of occupied households that subscribe to television service subscribe to Oceanic's cable service. There is no assurance we will be able to compete successfully against Oceanic. In particular, the costs to acquire programming is a significant and increasing cost, and there is no assurance our content acquisition costs will be in line with Oceanic's such that we can remain competitive. Direct broadcast satellite companies currently are not significant competitors, but this could change in the future.\nWireless Services. We provide wireless telecommunications services by use of a MVNO model in which we resell another carrier's facilities-based wireless services under the Hawaiian Telcom\u00ae brand name. The market in Hawaii for wireless telecommunications services is subject to intense competition. In addition, our wireless business may be less profitable than the wireless businesses of other telecommunications companies due to our use of a MVNO model.\nIf we do not adapt to technological changes in the telecommunications industry, we could lose customers or market share.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards which could reduce the competitiveness of our services. Adapting to technological developments could require unbudgeted upgrades or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming to implement. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to important new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and sell new services to our existing customers.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operations. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we develop our own technologies, products and services and rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our businesses. In recent years, the number of intellectual property infringement claims has been increasing in the communications industry and this could negatively impact us as a company.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations in Hawaii make our business susceptible to local economic and regulatory conditions and consumer trends, and an economic downturn, recession or unfavorable legislative or regulatory action could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nSubstantially all of our customers and operations are located in Hawaii. Because of Hawaii's geographic isolation, the successful operation and growth of our businesses is dependent on favorable economic and regulatory conditions in the state. The Hawaii economy, in turn, is dependent upon many factors, including:\n\u2022 the level of government and military spending;\n\u2022 the development of the local financial services industry;\n\u2022 the legal, regulatory and political environment;\n\u2022 the strength of the Hawaii tourism industry, which is in turn dependent on economic conditions principally in the U.S. mainland, Asia and Canada;\n\u2022 the availability of skilled labor;\n\u2022 the continued growth in services industries; and\n\u2022 the absence of hurricanes or other natural disasters and terrorism incidents.\nThe customer base for telecommunications services in Hawaii is small and geographically concentrated. The population of Hawaii is approximately 1.4 million, approximately 70% of whom live on the island of Oahu. Any adverse economic conditions affecting Oahu, or Hawaii generally, could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Labor shortages or increased labor costs in Hawaii could also have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified persons, or that future collective bargaining agreement negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor.\nIf the limitation on lump sum distributions under our union pension plan remains lifted, retirements of our experienced union employees could increase, which could have an adverse impact on our operations if we cannot timely hire and train replacements.\nOur union pension plan allows for lump sum distributions to employees who retire under certain circumstances. Since 2008, lump sum distributions have been limited to no more than 50% of the accrued amount, because of the funded status of the pension plan. If the funded status exceeds 80%, then the restrictions on lump sum distributions are lifted. In 2014, the funded status exceeded 80%, and a significant number of experienced union employees were eligible to retire and receive larger lump sum distributions. Although we have not experienced a significant number of employees retiring, if the restrictions on lump sum distributions remain lifted and a significant number of employees were to retire before we could hire and train their replacements, our operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nLimitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards, and other factors requiring us to pay cash to satisfy our tax liabilities in future periods, may affect our ability to fund our operations, make capital expenditures and repay our indebtedness.\nWe currently have a material amount of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and so-called \"built-in losses,\" all of which we intend to use in the future to reduce our federal and state taxable income. In the event that an \"ownership change\" were to occur with respect to our stock, it is possible that our ability to use our NOLs and built-in losses would become subject to an annual limitation. An ownership change could occur with respect to our stock merely as a result of one or more \"5-percent\nshareholders\" buying or selling our shares, even if no one person were to acquire a controlling percentage of our stock. Although we will monitor transfers of our stock, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer an ownership change with substantial adverse tax consequences.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness in relation to our equity. We maintain a Term Loan in the amount of $296 million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of $30 million (Revolving Credit Facility), each with a first priority lien on all assets.\nThe debt service requirements of our indebtedness could:\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy the service requirements of our other obligations, including pension funding obligations, investments required to maintain and upgrade our network and service fleet, investments required to introduce and deploy new products and services, as well as the operating costs of our businesses;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a higher than desired portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 make it difficult to secure credit terms with our vendors;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nIn addition, the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts.\nThe Term Loan matures in 2019. We generally do not expect to generate the necessary cash flow to repay our Term Loan in its entirety by the maturity date and such repayment in full is dependent upon the ability to refinance the Term Loan on reasonable terms. The ability to refinance the indebtedness on reasonable terms before the maturity date cannot be assured.\nTo service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our current indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We will likely need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to operate our business and pursue our business strategies, and a breach of such covenants may result in the acceleration of our long-term debt maturities.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022 sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022 invest in new products and services or make capital expenditures; and\n\u2022 incur liens.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants may prohibit us from prepaying our other indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters which occur in Hawaii could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nFrom time to time, Hawaii experiences severe weather conditions such as high winds and heavy rainfall, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunami, which can disrupt our services and damage our property. Such disruptions in service and damage to property could materially decrease our revenues and materially increase our expenses. In 2014 alone, Hawaii experienced two hurricanes and a volcanic eruption which adversely affected our financial results. While these events did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition, we cannot assure you that these types of events will not have such an impact in the future or that the insurance coverage we maintain for these risks will adequately compensate us for all damage and economic losses resulting from these types of events.\nConcentration of ownership among stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nBased on Schedules 13D and 13G filed by the respective holders, as of February 20, 2015, there are holders who own 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. Two of our stockholders collectively own approximately 40% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, acting together, may be able to determine the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could\nimpair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, may also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital by selling equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nOur success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.\nOur success depends upon the talents and efforts of our senior management team. The loss of any member of our senior management team, due to retirement or otherwise, and the inability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nApproximately half of our workforce is represented by a labor union and therefore subject to a collective bargaining agreement, which expires in 2018. The inability to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately half of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1357 (\"IBEW\") that expires in 2018. The inability to negotiate and enter into a new collective bargaining agreement on favorable terms could result in an increase in the Company's operating expenses or covered employees could strike or engage in other collective behaviors. If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities. Future renegotiation of these and other labor agreements or the provisions of such labor agreements could adversely impact our service reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare, pension plans, wages and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.", "PERMNO": 12916, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "HCOM"}
