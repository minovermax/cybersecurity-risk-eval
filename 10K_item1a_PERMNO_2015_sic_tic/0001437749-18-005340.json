Future income is dependent on others finding new production on the Company\u2019s land to replace present production as it is depleted. Oil and gas prices as well as new technology will affect the possibility of new discoveries.\nCommodity Prices\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s operating income comes from the sale of commodities produced from its lands: oil and gas, and timber. Fluctuations in these commodity prices will directly impact net income. In 2017, average gas prices paid to the Company were 34.01% higher than the average in 2016, and average oil prices, excluding plants, were higher in 2017 than in 2016, by 21.19%. If the average oil and gas prices in 2017 reverted to the 2016 averages, income before income tax would have decreased by approximately 16.21%.\nNatural Disasters\nThe Company has approximately 10,618 net acres of timberland (pine and hardwood) in various stages of growth or age classes. A typical pine timber stand will be harvested after 30 to 35 years of growth with some thinning occurring during this time. A hardwood stand will be harvested after 45 to 50 years of growth. A natural disaster can have a material adverse effect on timber growth, reducing its value. Natural disasters could include a hurricane, tornado, high winds, heavy rains and flooding, and/or fire cause by lightning.\nInterest Rate Risks\nThe Company has no direct exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and minimal direct exposure to interest rates. The Company has an unsecured line of credit with Whitney National Bank with no outstanding balance. The Company has no current plans to draw against this line.", "PERMNO": 89948, "SIC": 6792, "TIC": "CKX"}
