RISK FACTORS\nRisks related to our Reliance on CNH Industrial\nWe are substantially dependent upon CNH Industrial, our primary supplier of equipment and parts inventory.\nThe substantial majority of our business involves the sale and distribution of new equipment and after-market parts supplied by CNH Industrial and the servicing of equipment manufactured by CNH Industrial. In fiscal 2021, CNH Industrial supplied approximately 74% of the new equipment sold in our Agriculture segment, 71% of the new equipment sold in our Construction segment, and 68% of the new equipment sold in our International segment, and supplied a significant portion of our parts inventory.\nIn addition to being our primary supplier, CNH Industrial provides us with the following important inputs for our business:\n\u2022Floorplan payable financing for the purchase of a substantial portion of our equipment inventory;\n\u2022Retail financing used by many of our customers to purchase CNH Industrial equipment from us;\n\u2022Reimbursement for warranty work performed by us pursuant to CNH Industrial\u2019s product warranties;\n\u2022Incentive programs and discount programs offered from time to time that enable us to price our products more competitively; and\n\u2022Promotional and marketing activities on national, regional and local levels.\nOur financial performance and future success are highly dependent on the overall reputation, brand and success of CNH Industrial in the agricultural and construction equipment manufacturing industries, including its ability to maintain a competitive position in product innovation, product quality, and product pricing, and its ability to continue to provide financing to both us and our retail customers and warranty reimbursements for service work that we perform.\nCNH Industrial may terminate or change our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements.\nWe have entered into CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements under which we sell CNH Industrial\u2019s branded agricultural and construction equipment, along with after-market parts and repair services. Subject to applicable state statutes that may govern the dealer-manufacturer legal relationship, CNH Industrial may terminate our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements immediately in certain circumstances, following written notice and cure periods for certain breaches of the agreement, and for any reason under our Case Construction agreement following 120 days' prior written notice. If CNH Industrial were to terminate all or any of its CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements with us, our business would be severely harmed.\nFurthermore, CNH Industrial may unilaterally change its operating practices under the terms of the CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements to, among other things, change or authorize additional dealers in our sales and service areas, change its distribution system to the detriment of its dealers like us, limit our product offerings, and change pricing or delivery terms. If\nCNH Industrial were to change the terms of our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements or its operating practices in a manner that adversely affects us, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements impose obligations and restrictions on us.\nUnder our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements, we are obligated to actively promote the sale of CNH Industrial equipment within our designated geographic areas of responsibility, fulfill the product warranty obligations of CNH Industrial (subject to CNH Industrial\u2019s payment to us of the agreed upon reimbursement), maintain adequate facilities and workforce to service the needs of our customers, maintain equipment and parts inventories at the level deemed necessary by CNH Industrial to meet sales goals as stated in the annual business plan mutually agreed upon by us and CNH Industrial, maintain adequate working capital, and maintain stores only in authorized locations.\nConsent of CNH Industrial is required for certain material changes in our ownership, governance or business structure, including the acquisition by any person or group of persons of 30% or more of our outstanding stock or 20% or more of our outstanding stock if the acquiring person or group is a competitor of CNH Industrial. This requirement may have the effect of discouraging a sale or other change in control of the Company, including transactions that may be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe acquisition of additional CNH Industrial geographic areas of responsibility and store locations in our Agriculture, Construction and International segments requires the consent of CNH Industrial under our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements. CNH Industrial may decline, in its sole discretion, to consent to any acquisition of an additional CNH Industrial store location we may pursue. If CNH Industrial is unwilling to consent to any future proposed acquisition of additional dealerships, our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy and to grow our business may be impaired.\nOur CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements require us to operate any material business activities not related to sales of CNH Industrial products or services to customers in agricultural, construction, industrial or similar markets separately from our CNH Industrial dealership business. In addition, our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreement for Case Construction equipment prohibits us from carrying other suppliers' products (new equipment and parts) at our Case Construction stores that are competitive with CNH Industrial's products. These restrictions may discourage or prevent us from pursuing activities that we believe will grow our business.\nRisks related to Economic and Market Conditions\nOur agricultural equipment, parts and service sales are significantly affected by \"net farm income,\" over which we have no control.\nFarmers' capital expenditures often follow a cyclical pattern, with increased capital investments typically occurring during boom cycles spurred by high net farm income and strong farmer balance sheets. Net farm income is subject to numerous external factors that are beyond the control of the individual farmer including commodity prices, crop yields, crop input costs, and federal crop insurance and subsidy programs. Net farm income also impacts farmland values, which causes overall farm wealth to increase or decrease, impacting farmers\u2019 sentiment to make investments in equipment. The nature of the agricultural industry is such that a downturn in equipment demand can occur suddenly, resulting in negative impact on dealers including declining revenues, reduced profit margins, excess new and used equipment inventories, and increased floorplan interest expenses. These downturns may be prolonged, and during these periods, our revenues and profitability could be harmed. Demand for our parts and service, although not as cyclical as equipment purchases, also can be negatively affected in agricultural industry downturns and in regions affected by adverse weather or growing conditions which result in fewer acres planted or harvested.\nInternational and domestic trade laws, regulations and policies (including those that restrict global trade) and government farm programs can significantly affect net farm income and commodity prices and the demand for agricultural equipment.\nThe USDA has forecasted net farm income, a broad measure of farm profitability, to be $121.1 billion for calendar year 2020, which is expected to be one of the three most-profitable years over the past 50 years. Direct government aid of $46.3 billion accounted for approximately 38% of net farm income. Government aid included traditional farm program payments, trade compensation (to alleviate the impact of tariffs on commodity prices), and payments under the CARES Act. Changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, could significantly affect our farm customers and influence their demand for the equipment we sell.\nChanging worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world\u2019s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of farm equipment\nTrade restrictions, trade agreements, and imposition of tariffs, including past and uncertain developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could negatively impact the global trade of our farm customers\u2019 crops resulting in lower commodity prices and a reduction in demand for the equipment we sell.\nOur construction equipment, parts and service sales are affected by numerous market factors outside of our control.\nOur construction equipment customers primarily operate in the natural resource development, construction, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, industrial processing and utilities industries. These industries generally are capital intensive and cyclical in nature. Many of our construction equipment customers are directly and indirectly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices in the agriculture, forestry, metals and minerals, petroleum and natural gas industries. Prolonged periods of low oil prices, natural gas prices and other commodity prices may result in decreased demand for our products and services by our customers operating in these industries.\nConstruction contractors' demand for our construction equipment, parts and repair services is affected by economic conditions at both a global and a local level. Economic conditions that negatively affect the construction industry, such as the tightening of credit standards which affect the ability of consumers or businesses to obtain financing for construction projects, could reduce our customers' demand for our construction equipment. The construction industry in many of our geographical areas has experienced periodic, and sometimes prolonged, economic down cycles. During these downturns our revenues and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nThe equipment distribution market is subject to supply-demand imbalances arising from factors over which we have no control, which can affect our profit margins on equipment sales.\nOver-production of equipment by one or more manufacturers, or a sudden reduction in demand for equipment, can dramatically disrupt the equipment market and cause downward pressure on our equipment profit margins. Customer leasing arrangements in the agriculture and construction equipment industries may also impact the level of industry-wide equipment inventory supplies. When leased equipment comes off lease, there may be an increase in the availability of late-model used equipment, which can create an inventory over-supply condition and put pressure on our equipment sales and margins, and have an adverse effect on values of our used equipment inventory and rental fleet equipment. Similarly, rental house companies engage in regular sales of rental fleet units, which can further disrupt the supply-demand balance. We have no control over or ability to significantly influence any of the foregoing factors affecting the equipment distribution markets. We will be subject, however, to the negative impact, including downward pressure on equipment profit margins, resulting from any supply- demand imbalances arising from those factors.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment distribution (including parts and service) and rental industries are highly competitive and fragmented, with large numbers of companies operating on a regional or local basis. Historically, our competitors have competed aggressively on the basis of pricing or inventory availability, resulting in decreased margins on our sales to the extent we choose to match our competitors' pricing. To the extent we choose not to match or remain within a reasonable competitive distance from our competitors' pricing, we may lose sales and market share. In addition, to the extent CNH Industrial's competitors (such as Deere, Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo, and AGCO) provide their dealers with more innovative or higher quality products, better customer financing, or have more effective marketing programs, or the CNH Industrial reputation or brand are tarnished in the marketplace or with our customers, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, e-commerce companies selling parts have negatively impacted dealers' parts sales and margins, and we expect that this competitive pressure will continue to increase in the future. Over the past few years, right-to-repair legislation has been introduced in state legislatures in certain of the states in which we do business; however, this legislation has not yet been enacted into law in any of those states.. Right-to-repair legislation generally would require the manufacturers of products to provide the purchaser and/or independent repair technicians with documents, diagnostic software, and other information that would allow the equipment to be repaired without having it returned to the dealer for repair. It is difficult to predict whether right to repair legislation will be enacted in any of the states where we do business or, if enacted, the scope and substantive details of the legislation. If enacted, right-to-repair legislation could have a negative impact on our parts and service business.\nRisks Related to the COVID Pandemic\nThe COVID pandemic has resulted in additional risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn late 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) surfaced in China and has spread to the United States, Europe and around the world, resulting in supply chain disruptions, volatilities in the stock market, lower oil and other commodity prices due to diminished demand, economic challenges for ethanol producers, and lockdown on international travel,\nall of which has adversely impacted the global economy and resulted in decreased demand from some of our customers. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of the business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy. Moreover, any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and manage our business. The future impact of COVID-19 on our business and, our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nRisks of International Operations\nOur international operations expose us to risks and uncertainties.\nWe currently operate dealership locations in Bulgaria, Germany, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. In fiscal 2021, total International segment revenues were 15.5% of our consolidated total revenue. As of January 31, 2021, total International segment assets were 21.7% of our consolidated total assets.\nOur operations in international markets subject us to risks and uncertainties arising from the differing legal, political, social and regulatory environments and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. These risks include:\n\u2022difficulties in implementing our business model in foreign markets;\n\u2022costs and diversion of domestic management attention related to oversight of international operations;\n\u2022unexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining import licenses;\n\u2022cyclicality of demand in European Union member states for agricultural equipment, based on availability of European Union government subsidy programs and tax incentives;\n\u2022unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of tax regulations, foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. laws that apply to the international operations of U.S. companies which may be difficult and costly to implement and monitor, can create competitive disadvantages if our competitors are not subject to such laws, and which, if violated, may result in substantial financial and reputational harm;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed may adversely affect the results of our operations, the value of our foreign assets and liabilities and our cash flows;\n\u2022the laws of the European countries in which we operate, unlike U.S. states, do not include specific dealer protection laws and, therefore, we may be more susceptible to actions of suppliers that are adverse to our interests such as termination of our dealer agreements for any reason or installing additional dealers in our designated territories; and\n\u2022geopolitical or economic instability.\nAny escalation of political tensions or economic instability in Ukraine, including as a result of heightened tensions between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, could create significant disruption in our Ukrainian operations and may have an adverse effect on our business operations in Ukraine. Previous periods of political tension and economic instability in Ukraine caused liquidity problems for our customers, which negatively impacted their purchasing decisions for our products and services, limited our ability to maintain working capital loans or increased the cost of maintaining such loans, and as a result of imposed currency exchange controls, restricted our ability to manage our cash held in Ukraine and our investment in our Ukrainian business. Our operations in Ukraine are subject to the risks of further devaluation of the local currency, increased interest rates and increased inflation.\nThese factors, in addition to others that we have not anticipated, may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nOur financial performance is dependent on our ability to effectively manage our inventory.\nOur dealership network requires substantial inventories of equipment and parts to be maintained at each store and company-wide to facilitate sales to customers on a timely basis. Our equipment inventory has traditionally represented 50% or more of our total assets. We need to maintain a proper balance of new and used equipment to assure satisfactory inventory turnover and to minimize floorplan financing costs.\nOur purchases of new equipment and parts are based primarily on projected demand. If actual sales are materially less than our forecasts, for example because of a significant drop in net farm income or a construction industry recession, we would experience an over-supply of new equipment inventory. An over-supply of new equipment inventory will generally cause downward pressure on our product sale prices and margins, decrease our inventory turns, and increase our floorplan financing expenses.\nOur used equipment is generally acquired as trade-ins from customers in connection with equipment sales to those customers. Equipment inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Adjustments to market value of inventory are recognized as a cost of sales, negatively impacting earnings, in the periods in which they occur. Our estimates of net realizable value for our used equipment, as determined at the time of the trade-in, may prove to be inaccurate, given the potential for sudden changes in market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Moving from our normal retail marketing channel to more aggressive marketing channels for specific pieces or categories of equipment inventory, particularly as equipment inventory ages, will generally result in lower sales prices. Pricing and other terms of sale of used equipment can be significantly adversely affected by the limited market for certain types of used equipment.\nFloorplan financing for our equipment inventory may not be available on favorable terms or at all, which would adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make acquisitions..\nWe generally purchase our equipment with the assistance of floorplan payable financing programs through CNH Industrial Capital and our other credit facilities. In addition, we have relied on our floorplan financing to provide capital for dealership acquisitions. In the event that our available financing sources are insufficient to satisfy our future requirements, we would be required to obtain financing from other sources. We may not be able to obtain this additional or alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. To the extent that this financing cannot be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our growth and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur level of indebtedness could limit our financial and operational flexibility.\nAs of January 31, 2021, our indebtedness included floorplan payable financing, real estate mortgage financing arrangements that are secured by real estate assets and other long-term debt. In addition, we have obligations under our lease agreements for our store locations and corporate headquarters. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes.\nWe expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations, debt service and capital expenditures. However, our cash flow and ability to borrow depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which may be beyond our control.\nThe credit agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain corporate and financial transactions, and require us to satisfy financial covenants.\nThe credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, may limit or place conditions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur more debt;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022merge, consolidate, or make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022transfer and sell assets, or divest of dealership stores;\n\u2022pay dividends or repurchase stock; and\n\u2022issue equity instruments.\nOur credit facilities with CNH Industrial Capital and DLL Finance require us to satisfy a net leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio on an ongoing basis, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under the Bank Syndicate Agreement, if our excess availability (i.e., borrowing base capacity less outstanding loan balance and certain reserves) falls below a certain threshold, we become subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to borrow under these credit agreements depends upon compliance with these financial covenants.\nOur failure to satisfy any covenant, absent a waiver or amendment, would cause us to be in default under our credit facilities and would enable our lenders to accelerate payment of the outstanding indebtedness. Each of our credit agreements include cross-default provisions which state that certain types of defaults under any other indebtedness agreement will also constitute a default under that credit agreement. If an event of default occurred, and the lender demanded accelerated payment, we may not be able to satisfy a pay-off request, whether through internal funds or a new financing.\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.\nA substantial portion of our floorplan and working capital borrowings, including the credit facilities with CNH Industrial Capital, the Bank Syndicate, DLL Finance, and our international floorplan facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our results of operations are sensitive to movements in interest rates. There are many economic factors outside our control that have in the past and may, in the future, impact rates of interest including publicly announced indices that underlie the interest obligations related to a certain portion of our debt. Factors that impact interest rates include governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, and international instability impacting domestic and foreign financial markets. Any increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may have consequences for us that cannot yet be predicted.\nThe Company has outstanding credit facilities, including its credit facilities with the Bank Syndicate and DLL Finance, with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. Alternative benchmark rates may replace LIBOR and could affect the Company\u2019s credit facilities. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly. Any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, and problems with the design or implementation of this ERP system could interfere with our business and operations.\nWe are engaged in the implementation of a new ERP system. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information to management important to the operation of our business. Our ERP transition has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant human and financial resources. We expect to continue to experience delays and challenges as we work toward the completion of the ERP conversion. Beyond cost and scheduling, potential flaws in the implementation of an ERP system may pose risks to the Company\u2019s ability to operate successfully and efficiently, including timely and accurate SEC filings. If we are unable to successfully implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment industries are highly seasonal, which can cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment businesses are highly seasonal, which causes our quarterly results to fluctuate during the year. Farmers generally purchase agricultural equipment and service work in preparation for, or in conjunction with, the spring planting and fall harvesting seasons. Construction equipment customers\u2019 purchases of equipment and service work, as well as rental of equipment, are also seasonal in our stores located in colder climates where construction work slows significantly in the winter months. In addition, the fourth quarter typically is a significant period for equipment sales in the U.S. because of our customers\u2019 year-end tax planning considerations, the timing of dealer incentives and the\nincrease in availability of farmers\u2019 funds from completed harvests and construction customers' funds from completed projects. Also, numerous external factors such as credit markets, commodity prices, weather conditions, and other circumstances may disrupt normal purchasing practices and customers\u2019 sentiment, further contributing to the seasonal fluctuations.\nWe are exposed to customer credit risks.\nWe extend credit to our customers for parts and service work, rental charges, and also for some equipment sales in our domestic and international operations. If we are unable to manage these credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions.\nOur customers\u2019 ability to obtain affordable financing is an important factor in their purchasing decisions, and directly affects our business.\nThe ability to obtain affordable financing is an important part of a customer's decision to purchase agricultural or construction equipment. Interest rate increases may make equipment purchases less affordable for customers and, as a result, our revenue and profitability may decrease.\nClimate and Weather Risks\nWeather conditions may negatively impact the agricultural and construction equipment markets and affect our financial results.\nWeather conditions, particularly severe floods and droughts, can have a significant adverse effect on growing conditions and on regional agricultural and construction markets. Adverse weather conditions may result in fewer acres being planted or harvested by farmers and reduced crop yields on those acres that are planted, and in delays or cancellations of construction projects. This in turn could result in lower demand for our agricultural and construction equipment and services and adversely affect our results of operation. Many sources report that severe weather events can be expected to become more frequent as a result of global climate change.\nNew or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change could increase costs of the equipment we purchase from our suppliers and increase our customers\u2019 costs of operations.\nThere is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to new international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions.\nThe regulation of GHG emissions from the equipment we sell could result in additional manufacturing costs to our suppliers who, in turn, will likely pass along those costs to us. We may not be successful in passing along the equipment price increases to our customers, which could impact our results of operation. To the extent that we attempt to pass along price increases to our customers, the costs of equipment increases which likely will negatively affect their purchasing decisions.\nMoreover, the GHG regulations could increase other input costs for our customers, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations. These economic impacts could negatively impact our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions.\nBecause the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, we are unable to predict its potential impact at this time.\nRisks related to our Rental Business\nOur rental operations subject us to risks including increased maintenance costs as our rental fleet ages, increased costs of new replacement equipment we use in our fleet, and losses upon disposition of rental fleet units.\nOur rental fleet margins are materially impacted by utilization of fleet assets, which is seasonal and can fluctuate materially due to weather and economic factors. If our rental equipment ages, the costs of maintaining that equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. The cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, changes in customer demand could cause some of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs.\nUpon the sale of a rental fleet unit, we include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of the equipment sold. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022market prices for like equipment;\n\u2022hours and condition of the equipment;\n\u2022time of year that the equipment is sold;\n\u2022the supply of used equipment in the market; and\n\u2022general economic conditions.\nAny significant decline in the selling prices for used rental equipment, or increased costs resulting from our rental operations, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks of our Growth Strategy\nIf our acquisition plans are unsuccessful, we may not achieve our planned long-term revenue growth.\nOur ability to grow through the acquisition of additional CNH Industrial geographic areas of responsibility and store locations or other businesses will be dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable values, our ability to compete effectively for available acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions. We may not successfully identify suitable targets, or if we do, we may not be able to close the transactions, or if we close the transactions, they may not be profitable. In addition, CNH Industrial's consent is required for the acquisition of any CNH Industrial dealership, and the consent of our lenders may be required for certain acquisitions. CNH Industrial typically evaluates management, historical performance, and capitalization of a prospective acquirer in determining whether to consent to the sale of a CNH Industrial dealership. We may not obtain the consent of CNH Industrial or our lenders for certain acquisitions we may propose.\nOur acquisitions may not be successful.\nThere are risks associated with acquisitions of new dealerships. These risks include incurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses; failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships; disrupting our ongoing business; diluting the effectiveness of our management; failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies; and impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also may have a significant impact on our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets. If the acquisitions giving rise to these intangible assets are unsuccessful, this may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.\nHuman Capital Risks\nOur business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur success in executing our operating and strategic plans depends on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees, including the managers of our field operations and our country managers in our international operations. The failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees will harm us.\nIn recent years, the equipment industry has experienced a shortage of qualified service technicians. If this trend worsens and we are not able to hire and retain qualified service technicians at acceptable levels, our ability to satisfy customers' service needs would be negatively impacted. Moreover, the technician shortage may increase our service technician compensation expense, and reduce our gross margins on service work.\nLabor organizing activities could negatively impact us.\nAlthough none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, there have been attempts to unionize our store personnel. The unionization of all or a substantial portion of our workforce could result in work slowdowns or stoppages, could increase our overall costs, could reduce our operating margins and reduce the efficiency of our operations at the affected locations, could adversely affect our flexibility to run our business competitively, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nLiability Risks\nSelling and renting agricultural and construction equipment, selling parts, and providing repair services subject us to liability risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nProducts sold, rented or serviced by us may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims that arise from the use of such products. Our commercial liability insurance may not be adequate to cover significant product liability claims, or we may not be able to secure such insurance on economically reasonable terms. An uninsured or partially insured claim for which indemnification from the manufacturer is not available could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made against us or against CNH Industrial or any of our other suppliers, our business may be adversely affected by any related negative publicity or any adverse impact on the reputation or brand of any of our suppliers, including CNH Industrial.\nStock Price Volatility\nOur common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results and financial condition as set forth in our earnings releases, guidance estimates released by agricultural or construction equipment manufacturers that serve the markets in which we operate, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, fluctuations in the price of crop commodities and natural resources, the condition of the financial markets, and other factors. Quarterly fluctuations resulting from the seasonality of our business may cause our results of operations and cash flows to underperform in relation to our quarterly modeling assumptions or the expectations of financial analysts or investors, which may cause volatility or decreases in our stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay. That multiple is in part dependent on investors\u2019 perception of the Company\u2019s future earnings growth prospects. If investors\u2019 perception of the Company\u2019s earnings growth prospects change, the Company\u2019s earnings multiple may decline, and its stock price could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.\nData Security Risks\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the systems of the third parties with whom we do business and the processing and maintenance of information is critical to our operations. Despite our and the third parties with whom we do business' security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions arising from power outages, telecommunication failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws that protect the privacy of personally identifiable information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, given our Europe operations, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent data protection requirement and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.\nWe maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.", "PERMNO": 92471, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "TITN"}
