{"cik": "92380", "company": "SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe airline industry is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions; in the event of unfavorable economic conditions or economic uncertainty, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively affected, which could require the Company to adjust its business strategies.\nThe airline industry, which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand, is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Historically, unfavorable U.S. economic conditions have driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel. For some consumers, leisure travel is a discretionary expense, and short-haul travelers, in particular, have the option to replace air travel with surface travel. Businesses are able to forego air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing and the Internet or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs, which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat. Unfavorable economic conditions have also historically hampered the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel, labor, and other costs. Although the U.S. economy has experienced a moderate recovery since emerging from a recession in 2009, any future U.S. or global economic uncertainty could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and could cause the Company to adjust its business strategies.\nThe Company\u2019s business has been significantly impacted by high and/or volatile fuel prices and the Company\u2019s operations are subject to disruption based on the timely supply of fuel; therefore, the Company\u2019s strategic plans and future profitability are likely to be impacted by the Company\u2019s ability to effectively address fuel price increases and fuel price volatility and availability.\nAirlines are inherently dependent upon energy to operate, and jet fuel and oil represented approximately 32 percent of the Company\u2019s operating expenses for 2014. Although the cost of fuel has declined in recent months, it continues to be unpredictable, and even a small change in market fuel prices can significantly affect profitability. Furthermore, volatility in fuel prices can be due to many external factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. For example, fuel prices can be impacted by political and economic factors, such as (i) dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the potential for hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas; (ii) limited domestic refining or pipeline capacity; (iii) worldwide demand for fuel, particularly in developing countries, which can result in inflated energy prices; (iv) changes in U.S. governmental policies on fuel production, transportation, taxes, and marketing; and (v) changes in currency exchange rates.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to effectively address fuel price increases can be limited by its ability to increase fares, which can be difficult in challenging economic environments when low fares are often used to stimulate traffic. The\nability to increase fares can also be limited by factors such as the historical low-fare reputation of Southwest, the portion of its Customer base that purchases travel for leisure purposes, the competitive nature of the airline industry generally, and the risk that higher fares will drive a decrease in demand.\nThe Company attempts to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices by utilizing over-the-counter fuel derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its future jet fuel purchases. However, because energy prices can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short amount of time, and due to the fact that the Company uses a variety of different derivative instruments and at different price points, the Company is subject to the risk that the fuel derivatives it uses will not provide adequate protection against significant increases in fuel prices and could in fact result in additional volatility in the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company is also subject to the risk that cash collateral may be required to be posted to fuel hedge counterparties, which could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial position and liquidity.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to the risk that its fuel derivatives will not be effective or that they will no longer qualify for hedge accounting under applicable accounting standards, which could create additional earnings volatility. Adjustments in the Company\u2019s overall fuel hedging strategy, as well as the ability of the commodities used in fuel hedging to qualify for special hedge accounting, are likely to continue to affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to cost-effectively hedge against increases in fuel prices.\nThe Company\u2019s fuel hedging arrangements and the various potential impacts of hedge accounting on the Company\u2019s financial position, cash flows, and results of operations are discussed in more detail under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d and in Note 1 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company is also reliant upon the readily available supply and timely delivery of jet fuel to the airports that it serves. A disruption in that supply could present significant challenges to the Company\u2019s operations, and could ultimately cause the cancellation of flights and/or the inability of the Company to provide service to a particular airport.\nThe Company\u2019s low-cost structure has historically been one of its primary competitive advantages, and many factors have affected and could continue to affect the Company\u2019s ability to control its costs.\nThe Company\u2019s low-cost structure has historically been one of its primary competitive advantages, as it has enabled Southwest to historically offer low fares, drive traffic volume, and grow market share. The Company\u2019s low-cost structure has become increasingly important as a result of the Company\u2019s decision to limit capacity growth in recent years in response to high fuel prices and uncertain economic conditions. While the Company has in the past at times been able to cover increasing costs through growth, the combination of capacity control and increasing costs in recent years has contributed to an increase in the Company\u2019s costs per available seat mile.\nThe Company has limited control over fuel and labor costs, as well as other costs such as regulatory compliance costs. Jet fuel and oil constituted approximately 32 percent of the Company\u2019s operating expenses during 2014, and the cost of fuel is subject to the external factors discussed in the second Risk Factor above. Salaries, wages, and benefits constituted approximately 33 percent of the Company\u2019s operating expenses during 2014. The Company\u2019s ability to control labor costs is limited by the terms of its CBAs, and increased labor costs have negatively impacted the Company\u2019s low-cost competitive position. As discussed further under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the Company\u2019s unionized workforce, which makes up the majority of its Employees, has had pay scale increases as a result of contractual rate increases. Furthermore, as indicated above under \u201cBusiness-Employees,\u201d the majority of Southwest\u2019s unionized Employees, including its Pilots, Mechanics, Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents, Flight Attendants, Material Specialists, and Facilities Maintenance Technicians are in unions currently in negotiations for labor agreements, which could continue to put pressure on the Company\u2019s labor costs. In addition, the Company anticipates that the combination of the various Southwest and AirTran labor contracts and frontline workforces will increase labor costs over their historical levels. As discussed above under \u201cBusiness-Regulation,\u201d the airline industry is heavily regulated, and the Company\u2019s regulatory compliance costs are subject to potentially significant increases from time to time based on actions by the regulatory agencies. Additionally, when other airlines reduce their capacity, airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights, which can result in increased landing fees and other costs for the Company. The Company is also reliant upon third party\nvendors and service providers, and its low-cost advantage is also dependent in part on its ability to obtain and maintain commercially reasonable terms with those parties.\nAs discussed above under \u201cBusiness-Insurance,\u201d the Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline industry and, in the past, has also been provided supplemental, first-party, war-risk insurance coverage by the federal government. Since the government-provided supplemental coverage from the Wartime Act was set to expire on September 30, 2014, the Company proactively canceled its government provided war-risk insurance coverage on May 15, 2014, and effective the same date, purchased comparable coverage via the commercial insurance marketplace. Although the Company was able to purchase comparable coverage via the commercial insurance marketplace, available commercial insurance in the future could be more expensive and/or have material differences in coverage than is currently provided and may not be adequate to protect against the Company's risk of loss from future acts of terrorism. In addition, an accident or other incident involving Southwest aircraft could result in costs in excess of its related insurance coverage, which costs could be substantial. Any aircraft accident or other incident, even if fully insured, could also have a material adverse effect on the public\u2019s perception of the Company.\nThe Company cannot guarantee it will be able to maintain or improve upon its current level of low-cost advantage over many of its airline competitors. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have achieved substantially lower employee pay scales through bankruptcy than the Company. Additionally, in recent years, in response to high fuel prices and economic uncertainty, some of the Company\u2019s competitors implemented additional efficiency and cost reduction measures, such as capacity cuts and headcount reductions, which have reduced the Company\u2019s cost advantage. Further, other competitors have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks, potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile. In addition, some competitors have announced plans to add a significant number of new aircraft to their fleets, which could potentially decrease their operating costs through better fuel efficiencies, and lower maintenance costs. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have taken advantage of reorganization in bankruptcy, and even the threat of bankruptcy, not only to lower employee pay scales, but also to decrease operating costs through renegotiated supply and financing agreements. In addition, some airlines have consolidated and reported significant expected cost synergies.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on technology to operate its business and continues to implement substantial changes to its information systems; any failure or disruption in the Company\u2019s information systems could materially adversely affect its operations.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on the use of complex technology and systems to run its ongoing operations. In addition, technology is critical to the success of the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives. In recent years the Company has been committed to technology improvements to support its ongoing operations and initiatives and, as discussed above under \u201cBusiness - Management Information Systems,\u201d the Company has invested in significant technology changes to support its initiatives. For example, during 2014, the Company selected Amadeus' Alt\u00e9a reservations solution as the Company's future single reservation system for both domestic and international reservations. This single reservation system is expected to be delivered over a multi-year period. The Company intends to continue to devote significant technology resources towards, among other things, (i) the development of new systems to improve both revenue management and network optimization capabilities, (ii) replacement of Southwest's existing domestic reservation system with the comprehensive Amadeus' Alt\u00e9a reservations solution, and (iii) a new suite of operational tools that the Company expects will improve operational management.\nIntegration of complex systems and technology presents significant challenges in terms of costs, human resources, and development of effective internal controls. Integration also presents the risk of operational or security inadequacy or interruption, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s ability to effectively operate its business. The Company is also reliant upon third party performance for timely and effective completion of many of its technology initiatives.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company\u2019s systems will continue to require modification and refinements to address growth and changing business requirements, including requirements related to international operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s systems may require modification to enable the Company to comply with changing regulatory requirements. For example, in connection with the increase to the Transportation Security Fee discussed above under \u201cRegulation - Aviation Taxes,\u201d modifications and refinements to the Company\u2019s systems were required in connection with both the July 2014 implementation of the Transportation Security Fee increase and amendments to this increase\nin December 2014. In addition, software was developed for Pilot scheduling in response to the DOT\u2019s and FAA\u2019s flight, duty, and rest regulations that went into effect in January 2014. Modifications and refinements to the Company\u2019s systems have been and are expected to continue to be expensive to implement and may divert management\u2019s attention from other key initiatives. In addition, the Company\u2019s operations could be adversely affected, or it could face imposition of regulatory penalties, if it is unable to timely or effectively modify its systems as necessary.\nThe Company may occasionally experience system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond, which could prevent the Company from efficiently processing Customer transactions or providing services. This in turn could reduce the Company\u2019s operating revenues and the attractiveness of its services. The Company\u2019s computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, power loss, computer and telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, security breaches, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent the Company from processing Customer transactions or providing services, which could make the Company\u2019s business and services less attractive and subject the Company to liability. Any of these events could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and be expensive to remedy.\nThe Company\u2019s business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company would be adversely affected if it were unable to maintain satisfactory relations with its Employees or its Employees\u2019 Representatives or if the Company were unable to employ sufficient numbers of qualified Employees to maintain its operations.\nThe airline business is labor intensive. Salaries, wages, and benefits represented approximately 33 percent of the Company\u2019s operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 83 percent of the Company\u2019s Employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, making the Company particularly exposed in the event of labor-related job actions. Employment-related issues that may impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, some of which are negotiated items, include hiring/retention rates, pay rates, outsourcing costs, work rules, and health care costs. The Company has historically maintained positive relationships with its Employees and its Employees\u2019 Representatives. However, as indicated above under \u201cBusiness-Employees,\u201d the majority of Southwest\u2019s unionized Employees, including its Pilots; Mechanics; Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents; Flight Attendants; Material Specialists; and Facilities Maintenance Technicians, are in unions currently in negotiations for labor agreements, which could continue to put pressure on the Company\u2019s labor costs. Increasing labor costs, whether or not combined with curtailed growth, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s competitive position.\nThe Company\u2019s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled personnel. Competition for skilled personnel may intensify if overall industry capacity increases and/or if high levels of current personnel reach retirement age. The Company may be required to increase existing levels of compensation to retain or supplement its skilled workforce. The inability to recruit and retain skilled personnel or the unexpected loss of key skilled personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is currently dependent on single aircraft and engine suppliers, as well as single suppliers of certain other parts; therefore, the Company would be materially adversely affected if it were unable to obtain additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers or in the event of a mechanical or regulatory issue associated with their equipment.\nThe Company is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many of its aircraft parts and is dependent on other suppliers for certain other aircraft parts. Although the Company is able to purchase some aircraft from parties other than Boeing, most of its purchases are directly from Boeing. Therefore, if the Company were unable to acquire additional aircraft from Boeing, or if Boeing were unable or unwilling to make timely deliveries of aircraft or to provide adequate support for its products, the Company\u2019s operations would be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Company would be materially adversely affected in the event of a mechanical or regulatory issue associated with the Boeing 737 aircraft type, whether as a result of downtime for part or all of the Company\u2019s fleet or because of a negative perception by the flying public. The Company believes, however, that its years of experience with the Boeing 737 aircraft type, as well as the efficiencies Southwest has historically achieved by operating with a single aircraft type, currently outweigh the risks associated with its single aircraft supplier strategy. To enable Southwest to sustain the benefits associated with operating a single aircraft type, in July 2012 the Company entered into an agreement with\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. and Boeing Capital Corp. to lease or sublease all 88 of AirTran\u2019s Boeing 717-200 aircraft to Delta. Deliveries to Delta began in September 2013 at the rate of approximately three aircraft per month. As of December 31, 2014, all 88 of AirTran\u2019s Boeing 717-200 aircraft had been removed from service and 52 had been delivered to Delta. The Company is also dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines and certain other aircraft parts and would therefore also be materially adversely affected in the event of the unavailability of, or a mechanical or regulatory issue associated with, engines and other parts.\nAny failure of the Company to maintain the security of certain Customer-related information could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and could be costly to remediate.\nThe Company must receive information related to its Customers in order to run its business, and the Company\u2019s online operations depend upon the secure transmission of information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. This information is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering, and theft. Although the Company maintains systems to prevent this from occurring, these systems require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, and security could be compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated, or system disruptions could occur. The Company must also provide certain confidential, proprietary, and personal information to third parties in the ordinary course of its business. While the Company seeks to obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties could be breached. A compromise of the Company\u2019s security systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and disrupt its operations and could also result in litigation against the Company or the imposition of penalties. In addition, it could be costly to remediate. Although the Company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, the Company has experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventive and detective measures put in place by the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely impacted if it is unable to grow or to timely and effectively implement its revenue and other initiatives.\nSouthwest has historically been regarded as a growth airline; however, less than satisfactory returns on capital caused by the combination of a difficult economic environment and growing jet fuel costs led to the Company\u2019s decision to limit organic growth in recent years. In addition, organic growth has become increasingly difficult, because (i) the number of opportunities for domestic expansion has declined; (ii) the Company's international network is small and not yet developed; and (iii) the Company has faced an increased presence of other low-cost, low-fare carriers. As a result, the Company has become increasingly reliant on the success of revenue initiatives to help offset increasing costs and to continue to improve Customer Service. The timely and effective implementation of these initiatives has involved, and will continue to involve, significant investments by the Company of time and money and could be negatively affected by (i) the Company\u2019s ability to timely and effectively implement, transition, and maintain related information technology systems and infrastructure; (ii) the Company\u2019s ability to effectively balance its investment of incremental operating expenses and capital expenditures related to its initiatives against the need to effectively control costs; and (iii) the Company\u2019s dependence on third parties to assist with implementation of its initiatives. The Company cannot ensure the timing of implementation of certain of its initiatives or that they will be successful or profitable either over the short or long-term.\nInstability of credit, capital, and energy markets can result in pressure on the Company\u2019s credit ratings and can also negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and the Company\u2019s liquidity generally.\nDuring the recession in 2009, the Company\u2019s credit ratings were pressured by weak industry revenue and an extraordinarily volatile fuel price environment. While the Company\u2019s credit rating is \u201cinvestment grade,\u201d factors such as future unfavorable economic conditions, a significant decline in demand for air travel, or instability of the credit and capital markets could result in future pressure on credit ratings, which could negatively affect (i) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, (ii) the Company\u2019s liquidity generally, and (iii) the availability and cost of insurance. A credit rating downgrade could subject the Company to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements, the pricing related to any funds drawn under its revolving credit facility, and some of its hedging counterparty agreements. The potential effect of credit rating downgrades is discussed in more detail below under \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nThe airline industry has faced on-going security concerns and related cost burdens; further threatened or actual terrorist attacks, or other hostilities, could significantly harm the airline industry and the Company\u2019s operations.\nTerrorist attacks and threatened attacks have from time to time materially adversely affected the demand for air travel and also have resulted in increased safety and security costs for the Company and the airline industry generally. Safety measures create delays and inconveniences and can, in particular, reduce the Company\u2019s competitiveness against surface transportation for short-haul routes. Additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of such attacks or other hostilities (including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights due to terror threats) would likely have a further significant negative impact on the Company and the airline industry.\nAirport capacity constraints and air traffic control inefficiencies could limit the Company\u2019s growth; changes in or additional governmental regulation could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business.\nAlmost all commercial service airports are owned and/or operated by units of local or state governments. Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost. Similarly, the federal government singularly controls all U.S. airspace, and airlines are completely dependent on the FAA operating that airspace in a safe and efficient manner. The air traffic control system, which is operated by the FAA, could continue to face airspace and/or airport congestion challenges in the future, which could limit the Company\u2019s opportunities for growth. As discussed above under \u201cBusiness - Regulation,\u201d airlines are also subject to other extensive regulatory requirements. These requirements often impose substantial costs on airlines. The Company\u2019s initiatives and results of operations could be negatively affected by changes in law and future actions taken by domestic and foreign governmental agencies having jurisdiction over its operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreases in airport rates and charges;\n\u2022\nlimitations on airport gate capacity or use of other airport facilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on route authorities;\n\u2022\nactions and decisions that create difficulties in obtaining access at slot-controlled airports;\n\u2022\nactions and decisions that create difficulties in obtaining operating permits and approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges to environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nnew or increased taxes or fees, such as the July 2014 increased Transportation Security Fee discussed above under \u201cRegulation - Aviation Taxes\u201d;\n\u2022\nchanges to laws that affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on competitive practices;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws that increase costs for safety, security, compliance, or other Customer Service standards, such as the FAA regulations with respect to Pilot flight/duty time limitations and rest requirements discussed above under \u201cBusiness - Regulation\u201d;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws that may limit the Company's ability to enter into fuel derivative contracts to hedge against increases in fuel prices;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws that may limit or regulate the Company\u2019s ability to promote the Company\u2019s business or fares; and\n\u2022\nthe adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise regulations.\nBecause expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers can have a disproportionate effect on an airline\u2019s operating and financial results. Therefore, any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the factors listed above could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, in instances where the airline industry shrinks, many airport operating costs are essentially unchanged and must be shared by the remaining operating carriers, which can therefore increase the Company\u2019s costs.\nThe airline industry is affected by many conditions that are beyond its control, which can impact the Company\u2019s business strategies and results of operations.\nIn addition to the unpredictable economic conditions and fuel costs discussed above, the Company, like the airline industry in general, is affected by conditions that are largely unforeseeable and outside of its control, including, among others:\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of disease;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns, or demographic trends (including, without limitation, changes in government travel patterns due to government shutdowns or sequestration);\n\u2022\nactual or potential disruptions in the air traffic control system (including, without limitation, as a result of potential FAA budget cuts due to government shutdowns or sequestration);\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, industry bankruptcies, and other factors;\n\u2022\nair traffic congestion and other air traffic control issues; and\n\u2022\nactual or threatened war, terrorist attacks, and political instability.\nThe airline industry is intensely competitive.\nAs discussed in more detail above under \u201cBusiness - Competition,\u201d the airline industry is intensely competitive. The Company\u2019s primary competitors include other major domestic airlines, as well as regional and new entrant airlines, surface transportation, and alternatives to transportation such as videoconferencing and the Internet. The Company\u2019s revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers with respect to pricing, routes, frequent flyer programs, scheduling, capacity, Customer Service, comfort and amenities, cost structure, aircraft fleet, and codesharing and similar activities.\nThe Company\u2019s future results will suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations, including its international operations.\nAs the Company expands its international flight offerings, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) will become an increasingly important federal agency. CBP personnel and CBP-mandated procedures can affect the Company\u2019s operations, costs, and Customer experience. The Company will make significant investments in facilities, equipment, and technologies at certain airports in order to improve the Customer experience and to assist CBP with its inspection and processing duties; however, the Company is not able to predict the impact, if any, that various CBP measures or the lack of CBP resources will have on Company revenues and costs, either in the short-term or the long-term.\nInternational flying requires the Company to modify certain processes, as the airport environment is dramatically different in certain international locations with respect to, among other things, common-use ticket counters and gate areas, local operating requirements, and cultural preferences. In addition, international flying exposes the Company to certain foreign currency risks to the extent the Company chooses to, or is required to, transact in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent the Company seeks to serve additional foreign destinations in the future, it will be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and approvals from the FAA, as well as any applicable foreign government or other authority.\nThe Company\u2019s expansion of its operations into non-U.S. jurisdictions also expands the scope of the laws to which the Company is subject, both domestically and internationally. In addition, operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of those jurisdictions rather than U.S. laws. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the United States, and these differences can affect the Company\u2019s ability to react to changes in its business, and its rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Furthermore, enforcement of laws in some jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both the Company\u2019s ability to enforce its rights and to undertake activities that it believes are beneficial to its business. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue and its expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law governed these operations. Although the Company has policies and procedures in place\nthat are designed to promote compliance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates, a violation by the Company\u2019s Employees, contractors, or agents or other intermediaries, could nonetheless occur. Any violation (or alleged or perceived violation), even if prohibited by the Company\u2019s policies, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation and/or its results of operations.\nAirTran is currently subject to pending antitrust litigation, and if judgment were to be rendered against AirTran in the litigation, such judgment could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nA complaint alleging violations of federal antitrust laws and seeking certification as a class action was filed against Delta Air Lines, Inc. and AirTran in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta on May 22, 2009. The complaint alleged, among other things, that AirTran attempted to monopolize air travel in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and conspired with Delta in imposing $15-per-bag fees for the first item of checked luggage in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The initial complaint sought treble damages on behalf of a putative class of persons or entities in the United States who directly paid Delta and/or AirTran such fees on domestic flights beginning December 5, 2008. After the filing of the May 2009 complaint, various other nearly identical complaints also seeking certification as class actions were filed in federal district courts in Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; and Las Vegas, Nevada. All of the cases were consolidated before a single federal district court judge in Atlanta. A Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed in the consolidated action on February 1, 2010, which broadened the allegations to add claims that Delta and AirTran conspired to reduce capacity on competitive routes and to raise prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. In addition to treble damages for the amount of first baggage fees paid to AirTran and to Delta, the Consolidated Amended Complaint seeks injunctive relief against a broad range of alleged anticompetitive activities, as well as attorneys' fees. On August 2, 2010, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims that AirTran and Delta had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act; the Court let stand the claims of a conspiracy with respect to the imposition of a first bag fee and the airlines' capacity and pricing decisions. On June 30, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class, which AirTran and Delta have opposed. The parties have submitted briefs on class certification, and AirTran filed a motion to exclude the class certification reports of plaintiffs\u2019 expert. The Court has not yet ruled on the class certification motion or the related motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 expert. The parties engaged in extensive discovery, which was extended due to discovery disputes between plaintiffs and Delta, but discovery has now closed. On June 18, 2012, the parties filed a Stipulation and Order that plaintiffs have abandoned their claim that AirTran and Delta conspired to reduce capacity. On August 31, 2012, AirTran and Delta moved for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' remaining claims, but discovery disputes between plaintiffs and Delta have delayed further briefing on summary judgment. On December 2, 2013, plaintiffs moved for discovery sanctions against Delta, and the Court has suspended further briefing on (i) the motion for summary judgment, (ii) the motion for class certification, and (iii) the motion to strike plaintiffs\u2019 expert on class certification, until the sanctions motion is resolved. On May 14, 2014, the Court referred the sanctions dispute to a special master, the special master has issued a series of reports and recommendations, and plaintiffs and Delta have submitted objections to the special master\u2019s report and recommendations. While AirTran has denied all allegations of wrongdoing, including those in the Consolidated Amended Complaint, and intends to defend vigorously any and all such allegations, results of legal proceedings such as this one cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merit, this litigation and any potential future claims against the Company or AirTran may be both time consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. Should AirTran and the Company fail to prevail in this or other matters, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could materially adversely affect its business and might materially affect its financial condition and operating results.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in the Company recording a significant amount of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of AirTran, which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nIn accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules, the Company recorded goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheet to the extent the AirTran acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of AirTran\u2019s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually. Future impairment of Goodwill could be recorded in the Company's results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Factors which could result in an impairment, holding other assumptions constant, could include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions; (ii) significantly higher prices for\njet fuel; (iii) lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand; (iv) a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments; and (v) significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities, actual or threatened war, labor actions by Employees, or further industry regulation. The Company can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods. Any such charges may materially negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results.
