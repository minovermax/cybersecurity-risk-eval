Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nWe have a history of substantial net losses, and expect to continue to incur substantial net losses over the next few years, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nAs of June 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $356. 7 million and incurred a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2017 of $13.3 million. We may not achieve or sustain profitability in future years, which is dependent on numerous factors, including whether and when development and sales milestones are met, regulatory actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, the performance of our licensees, and market acceptance of our products. If we attain sustained profitability, it will not be until the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 at the earliest.\nWe expect to incur additional losses as we continue our development of natriuretic peptide and MC1r products. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity, total assets and working capital.\nSince 2005 we have not had any products available for commercial sale and have not received any revenues from the sale of our product candidates. For the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from license and contract revenue under collaborative development agreements, existing cash balances and outside sources of financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Unless and until we receive approval from the FDA or other equivalent regulatory authorities outside the United States, we cannot sell our products and will not have product revenues from them. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including preclinical and clinical trials. Because of the numerous risks associated with developing drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether or when any of our product candidates will become commercially available, or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nWe will need additional funding, including funding to complete clinical trials for our product candidates other than bremelanotide, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nUnder the license agreement with AMAG, we are contractually required to complete development and regulatory activities necessary to file an NDA for bremelanotide for HSDD in the United States. AMAG will reimburse us for up to an aggregate amount of $25 million for all reasonable, documented, direct out-of-pocket expenses we incur in completing these development and regulatory activities. To the extent that our expenses exceed this amount, we will be responsible for the required additional funding.\nIn addition to our responsibilities under the license agreement with AMAG, we intend to focus efforts on our other product candidates, including our natriuretic peptide and MC1r programs. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and investments of $55.6 million, with current liabilities of $19.9 million, net of deferred revenue of $35.1 million. After giving effect to the proceeds from our license agreements with AMAG and Fosun and the proceeds from the financing transactions on August 4, 2016 and December 6, 2016, we believe we currently have sufficient existing capital resources to fund our planned operations through at least the 2018 calendar year. We will need additional funding to complete development activities and required clinical trials for our other product candidates and development programs and, if those clinical trials are successful (which we cannot predict), to complete submission of required regulatory applications to the FDA.\nUntil the FDA approves bremelanotide for HSDD and marketing commences, if at all, we will not have any recurring revenue. Even if bremelanotide is approved and marketing commences, we cannot predict product sales or our resulting royalties, so we may not have any source of significant recurring revenue and may need to depend on financing or partnering to sustain our operations. We may raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements on our product candidates, or other sources. However, such financing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To obtain additional funding, we may need to enter into arrangements that require us to develop only certain of our product candidates or relinquish rights to certain technologies, product candidates and/or potential markets.\nIf we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds when needed, we may be required to curtail operations significantly, cease clinical trials and decrease staffing levels. We may seek to license, sell or otherwise dispose of our product candidates, technologies and contractual rights on the best possible terms available. Even if we are able to license, sell or otherwise dispose of our product candidates, technologies and contractual rights, it is likely to be on unfavorable terms and for less value than if we had the financial resources to develop or otherwise advance our product candidates, technologies and contractual rights ourselves.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to enter into one or more licensing or similar agreements for bremelanotide outside of North America and China;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for bremelanotide for HSDD and our other product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire;\n\u25cf\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our future product candidates, and conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of commercialization activities if any future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of manufacturing any future product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;\n\u25cf\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;\n\u25cf\nthe degree and rate of market acceptance of any future approved products;\n\u25cf\nthe emergence, approval, availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing products or treatments;\n\u25cf\nany product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n\u25cf\nthe expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u25cf\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, future approved products, if any.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to base an investment decision.\nOur operations are primarily focused on acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology, conducting preclinical and clinical studies and formulating and manufacturing on a small-scale basis our principal product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for stockholders to assess our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have not yet demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our current product candidates. The successful commercialization of our product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u25cf\ncontinuing to conduct preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nparticipating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u25cf\nformulating and manufacturing products, or having third parties formulate and manufacture products;\n\u25cf\npost-approval monitoring and surveillance of our products;\n\u25cf\nconducting sales and marketing activities, either alone or with a partner; and\n\u25cf\nobtaining additional capital.\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, to successfully commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval or to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to recover our investment in our development efforts.\nThe clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u25cf\ntimely completion of our clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors;\n\u25cf\nwhether we are required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional clinical trials beyond those planned to support the approval and commercialization of our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf\nacceptance of our proposed indications and primary endpoint assessments relating to the proposed indications of our product candidates by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\nour ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities, the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects experienced with our product candidates or future approved products, if any;\n\u25cf\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\nachieving and maintaining, and, where applicable, ensuring that our third-party contractors achieve and maintain, compliance with our contractual obligations and with all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates or any future product candidates or approved products, if any;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of third parties with whom we contract to manufacture clinical trial and commercial supplies of our product candidates or any future product candidates, remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with GMP;\n\u25cf\na continued acceptable safety profile and efficacy during clinical development and following approval of our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates in the United States and internationally, if approved for marketing, sale and distribution in such countries and territories, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf\nacceptance by physicians and patients of the benefits, safety and efficacy of our product candidates or any future product candidates, if approved, including relative to alternative and competing treatments;\n\u25cf\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to establish and enforce intellectual property rights in and to our product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or commercial-stage products that we believe can be successfully developed and commercialized.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our product candidates. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of our product candidates or any future product candidates to continue our business.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to existing shareholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe may seek the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interests will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a shareholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Strategy and Industry\nWe are substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of our product candidates, primarily our lead product candidate, bremelanotide for HSDD, but we and our licensees may never obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize bremelanotide for HSDD or any of our product candidates.\nTo date, we have invested most of our efforts and financial resources in the research and development of bremelanotide for HSDD, which is currently our lead product candidate. We licensed to AMAG all rights to bremelanotide in North America, but are contractually obligated to complete development and regulatory activities necessary to file an NDA for bremelanotide for HSDD in the United States, with AMAG reimbursing us for up to $25 million for reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses we incur. We licensed to Fosun rights to bremelanotide for China, but depending on the regulatory approval pathway utilized in China, approval in China may be contingent on approval of an NDA for bremelanotide for HSDD in the United States.\nOur near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our company and generate revenue, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of bremelanotide for HSDD, as well as any future product candidates. The clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\ntimely completion of, or need to conduct additional clinical trials and studies, including for bremelanotide for HSDD, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the accurate and satisfactory performance of third-party contractors;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA the safety and efficacy of bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates through clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nwhether we or our licensees are required by the FDA or other similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional clinical trials to support the approval of bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe acceptance of parameters for regulatory approval, including our proposed indication, primary endpoint assessment and primary endpoint measurement, relating to our lead indications of bremelanotide for HSDD;\n\u25cf\nthe success of our licensees in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of bremelanotide for HSDD, if approved;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates or approved products;\n\u25cf\nthe adequacy and regulatory compliance of the autoinjector device, supplied by an unaffiliated third party, to be used as part of the bremelanotide combination product;\n\u25cf\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\nour ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms to achieve our goals;\n\u25cf\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates or approved products;\n\u25cf\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our own or our future potential strategic collaborators\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to manufacture clinical trial supplies of bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates and to develop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current GMP;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of AMAG to successfully commercialize bremelanotide for HSDD;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully commercialize any future product candidates, if approved for marketing and sale, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims;\n\u25cf\nacceptance of bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates, if approved, as safe and effective by patients and the medical community; and\n\u25cf\na continued acceptable safety profile and efficacy of bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates following approval.\nIf we fail to satisfy any one of these prerequisites to our commercial success, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of bremelanotide for HSDD by AMAG and Fosun or through the sale of any future product candidate to continue our business. In addition to preventing us from executing our current business plan, any delays in our clinical trials, or inability to successfully commercialize our products could impair our reputation in the industry and the investment community, and could hinder our ability to fulfill our existing contractual commitments. As a result, our share price would likely decline significantly, and we would have difficulty raising necessary capital for future projects.\nWe do not control the development or commercialization of bremelanotide in North America, which is licensed to AMAG, and as a result we may not realize a significant portion of the potential value of the license arrangement with AMAG.\nAlthough we will conduct all development work to support an NDA for bremelanotide in HSDD, the license agreement with AMAG for bremelanotide in North America limits our control over development activities, including regulatory approvals, and we do not have any direct control over commercialization efforts. AMAG may abandon further development of bremelanotide in its licensed territory, including terminating the agreement, for any reason, including a change of priorities within AMAG or lack of success in ancillary clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. Because the potential value of the license arrangement with AMAG is contingent upon the successful development and commercialization of bremelanotide in the United States and other countries in the licensed territory, the ultimate value of this license will depend on the efforts of AMAG. If AMAG does not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval of bremelanotide in the United States for any reason, does not succeed in securing market acceptance of bremelanotide in the United States, or elects for any reason to discontinue development of bremelanotide, we will be unable to realize the potential value of this arrangement and would experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize bremelanotide.\nProduction and supply of bremelanotide depend on contract manufacturers over whom neither we nor AMAG have any control, and we may not have adequate supplies of bremelanotide.\nWe do not have the facilities to manufacture the bremelanotide active drug ingredient or the autoinjector pen component of the bremelanotide combination product, or to fill, assemble and package the bremelanotide combination product. AMAG, our exclusive licensee for North America for bremelanotide, has assumed responsibility for contract manufacturing. The contract manufacturers must perform these manufacturing activities in a manner that complies with FDA regulations. AMAG\u2019s ability to control third-party compliance with FDA requirements is limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection. The manufacturers of approved products and their manufacturing facilities will be subject to ongoing review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other authorities where applicable, and must comply with regulatory requirements, including FDA regulations concerning GMP. Failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with GMP, medical device quality system regulations, or other FDA requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA. Failure to conduct their activities in compliance with FDA regulations could delay bremelanotide development programs or negatively impact AMAG\u2019s ability to receive FDA approval of the bremelanotide potential products or continue marketing bremelanotide products if they are approved. Establishing relationships with new suppliers, who must be FDA-approved, is a time-consuming and costly process. If AMAG is not able to obtain adequate supplies of bremelanotide, it will be difficult for AMAG to develop bremelanotide and compete effectively.\nMost of our product candidates are still in the early stages of development, and all of our product candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval. If we are unable to successfully develop and test our product candidates, we will not be successful.\nOur product candidates are at various stages of research and development, will require regulatory approval, and may never be successfully developed or commercialized. Our product candidates will require significant further research, development and testing before we can seek regulatory approval to market and sell them. We must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in patients in order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. Preclinical studies in animals, using various doses and formulations, must be performed before we can begin human clinical trials. Even if we obtain favorable results in the preclinical studies, the results in humans may be different. Numerous small-scale human clinical trials may be necessary to obtain initial data on a product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy in humans before advancing to large scale human clinical trials. We face the risk that the results of our trials in later phases of clinical trials may be inconsistent with those obtained in earlier phases. Adverse or inconclusive results could delay the progress of our development programs and may prevent us from filing for regulatory approval of our product candidates. Additional factors that could inhibit the successful development of our product candidates include:\n\u25cf\nlack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials or the failure of our product candidates to meet specified endpoints;\n\u25cf\nfailure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n\u25cf\ninability to develop or obtain a supplier for an autoinjector device that meets the FDA\u2019s medical device requirements;\n\u25cf\ninsufficient data to support regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;\n\u25cf\ninability to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u25cf\nthe availability of sufficient capital to sustain operations and clinical trials.\nYou should evaluate us in light of these uncertainties, difficulties and expenses commonly experienced by early stage biopharmaceutical companies, as well as unanticipated problems and additional costs relating to:\n\u25cf\nproduct approval or clearance;\n\u25cf\nregulatory compliance;\n\u25cf\ngood manufacturing practices;\n\u25cf\nintellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nproduct introduction; and\n\u25cf\nmarketing and competition.\nIf clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged or delayed, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.\nWe may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis due to unexpected delays in our human clinical trials. Potential delaying events include:\n\u25cf\ndiscovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials resulting from numerous factors, including the prevalence of other companies\u2019 clinical trials for their product candidates for the same indication, or clinical trials for indications for which patients do not as commonly seek treatment;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in retaining subjects who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw at any time due to adverse side effects from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or for any other reason;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in obtaining IRB approval for studies to be conducted at each site;\n\u25cf\ndelays in manufacturing or obtaining, or inability to manufacture or obtain, sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ninadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or the product formulation or method of delivery;\n\u25cf\nchanges in applicable laws, regulations and regulatory policies;\n\u25cf\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), clinical trial sites and other third-party contractors;\n\u25cf\nfailure of our CROs or other third-party contractors to comply with contractual and regulatory requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u25cf\nfailure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees or any partner with which we may collaborate or their employees to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials or the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for drug, medical device and biologic products;\n\u25cf\ndelays in the scheduling and performance by the FDA of required inspections of us, our CROs, our suppliers, or our clinical trial sites, and violations of law or regulations by discovered in the course of FDA inspections;\n\u25cf\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions; or\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data.\nAny of these events or other delaying events, individually or in the aggregate, could delay the commercialization of our product candidates and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to secure and maintain research institutions to conduct our clinical trials.\nWe rely on research institutions to conduct our clinical trials, and we therefore have limited control over the timing and cost of clinical trials and our ability to recruit subjects. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable research institutions on acceptable terms, or if any such agreement is terminated, we may be unable to quickly replace the research institution with another qualified institution on acceptable terms. We may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research institutions to conduct our clinical trials.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operation will be materially adversely affected.\nRegulatory approval for the marketing and sale of any of our product candidates does not assure the product\u2019s commercial success. Any approved product will compete with other products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies. If any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA and do not achieve adequate market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. The degree of market acceptance of any such product will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of any such product;\n\u25cf\ncost-effectiveness relative to competing products and technologies;\n\u25cf\navailability of reimbursement for our products from third-party payers such as health insurers, HMOs and government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; and\n\u25cf\nadvantages over alternative treatment methods.\nThere is one FDA approved product for treatment of HSDD, flibanserin, which is sold under the trade name Addyi\u00ae, and started marketing in October 2015. The actual market size and market dynamics for HSDD are unknown, and there is significant uncertainty concerning the extent and scope of third-party reimbursement for products treating HSDD. While we believe that an on-demand drug for HSDD has competitive advantages compared to chronic or daily use hormones and other drugs, we may not be able to realize this perceived advantage in the market. Bremelanotide is administered by subcutaneous injection. While the single-use, disposable autoinjector pen format is designed to maximize market acceptability, bremelanotide as a subcutaneous injectable drug for HSDD may never achieve significant market acceptance. In addition, we believe reimbursement of bremelanotide from third-party payers such as health insurers, HMOs or other third-party payers of healthcare costs will be similar to reimbursement for ED drugs, and that the ultimate user may pay a substantial part of the cost of bremelanotide for HSDD. If the market opportunity for bremelanotide is smaller than we anticipate, it may also be difficult for us to find marketing partners and, as a result, we may be unable to generate revenue and business from bremelanotide. If bremelanotide for HSDD does not achieve adequate market acceptance at an acceptable price point, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the United States, we may never receive approval or commercialize our products outside of the United States.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setbacks in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our product candidates and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf side effects emerge that can be linked to our product candidates (either while they are in development or after they are approved and on the market), we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, change the labeling of any such products, or withdraw such products from the market, any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues.\nIf we identify side effects or other problems occur in future clinical trials, we may be required to terminate or delay clinical development of the product candidate. Furthermore, even if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, as greater numbers of patients use a drug following its approval, if the incidence of side effects increases or if other problems are observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical trials, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to reformulate such products or change the way the product is manufactured;\n\u25cf\nwe may become the target of lawsuits, including class action suits; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation in the market place may suffer resulting in a significant drop in the sales of such products.\nAny of these events could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing, commercializing and marketing any such product candidates or could harm or prevent sales of any approved products.\nThe number of subjects in our study pools in our clinical trials may be deemed by regulators to be too small, which could cause unanticipated delays or higher than anticipated costs.\nOur clinical trials have been conducted on a pool of subjects that is structured for such research. Nevertheless, there is the possibility that for statistical reasons, the pool of subjects may be determined by the FDA or another regulatory body to be too small to verify statistical significance. In such a case, the conclusions from the previous trials will need to be established with at least another set of clinical trials testing the relevant issue. Due to the need to find new subjects for any additional clinical trials and the limited pool from which such subjects can be selected, any such determination by the FDA could result in a delay in obtaining FDA approval or require additional financial expenditures.\nWe may not be able to keep up with the rapid technological change in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which could make any future approved products obsolete and reduce our revenue.\nBiotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our drug discovery process that we believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies. In addition, any future products that we develop, including our clinical product candidates, may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing those products, which may require that we raise additional funds to continue our operations.\nCompeting products and technologies may make our proposed products noncompetitive.\nFlibanserin, a daily-use oral drug sold under the trade name Addyi\u00ae, has been approved by the FDA for HSDD in premenopausal women. There are other products being developed for HSDD and other FSD indications, including a number of oral combination drugs, some of which incorporate testosterone, antidepressants or PDE-5 inhibitors. There is competition to develop drugs for treatment of HSDD and FSD in both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. Our bremelanotide drug product is intended to be administered by subcutaneous injection, and an as needed drug product for the same indication which utilizes another route of administration, such as a conventional oral drug product, may make subcutaneous bremelanotide noncompetitive.\nThere are several products approved for use in treatment of obesity and related indications, and a number of other products being developed for treatment of obesity, including products in clinical trials. There is intense competition to develop drugs for treatment of obesity and related indications.\nThere are a number of products approved for use in treating inflammatory diseases and indications, and other products are being developed, including products in clinical trials.\nWe are aware of one recombinant natriuretic peptide product for acutely decompensated congestive heart failure approved and marketed in the United States, and another recombinant natriuretic peptide product approved and marketed in Japan. Clinical trials on other natriuretic peptide products are being conducted in the United States. In addition, other products for treatment of heart failure are either currently being marketed or in development, including a combination drug which increases active levels of ANP.\nAs discussed above, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We are likely to encounter significant competition with respect to bremelanotide, other melanocortin receptor agonist compounds and PL-3994. Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do. Many of them also have significantly greater experience in research and development, marketing, distribution and sales than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in developing, marketing, distributing and selling products and underlying technologies more rapidly than we can. These competitive products or technologies may be more effective and useful or less costly than bremelanotide, other melanocortin receptor agonist compounds or PL-3994. In addition, academic institutions, hospitals, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research and may develop competing products or technologies on their own or through strategic alliances or collaborative arrangements.\nWe rely on third parties over whom we have no control to conduct preclinical studies, clinical trials and other research for our product candidates and their failure to timely perform their obligations could significantly harm our product development.\nWe have limited research and development staff and do not have dedicated research or development facilities. We rely on third parties and independent contractors, such as researchers at CROs and universities, in certain areas that are particularly relevant to our research and product development plans. We engage such researchers to conduct our preclinical studies, clinical trials and associated tests. These outside contractors are not our employees and may terminate their engagements with us at any time. In addition, we have limited control over the resources that these contractors devote to our programs and they may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. There is also competition for these relationships, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our contractors on acceptable terms. If our third-party contractors do not carry out their duties under their agreements with us, fail to meet expected deadlines or fail to comply with appropriate standards for preclinical or clinical research, our ability to develop our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, may be materially adversely affected.\nProduction and supply of our product candidates depend on contract manufacturers over whom we have no control, with the risk that we may not have adequate supplies of our product candidates or products.\nWe do not have the facilities to manufacture our early stage potential products such as PL-3994, PL-8177 and other melanocortin receptor agonist compounds for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Contract manufacturers must perform these manufacturing activities in a manner that complies with FDA regulations. Our ability to control third-party compliance with FDA requirements is limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection. The manufacturers of our potential products and their manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other authorities where applicable, and must comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, including FDA regulations concerning GMP. Failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with GMP, medical device QSR, or other FDA requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA. Failure to conduct their activities in compliance with FDA regulations could delay our development programs or negatively impact our ability to receive FDA approval of our potential products. Establishing relationships with new suppliers, who must be FDA-approved, is a time-consuming and costly process.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities within our organization or enter into and maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenue.\nWe do not currently have any experience in sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We will need to establish sales and marketing capabilities within our organization or establish and maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates. We do not have marketing partners for any of our products, including bremelanotide and PL-3994. If any of these products are approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we must either develop marketing, distribution and selling capacity and expertise, which will be costly and time consuming, or enter into agreements with other companies to provide these capabilities. We may not be able to enter into suitable agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. Engaging a third party to perform these services could delay the commercialization of any of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and our business would suffer. In addition, if we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we could market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.\nWe will need to hire additional employees in order to commercialize our product candidates in the future. Any inability to manage future growth could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates, increase our costs and adversely impact our ability to compete effectively.\nIn order to commercialize our product candidates, we will need to hire experienced sales and marketing personnel to sell and market those product candidates we decide to commercialize, and we will need to expand the number of our managerial, operational, financial and other employees to support commercialization. Competition exists for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field.\nFuture growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nOur ability to achieve revenues from the sale of our products in development will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers and other healthcare payers.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products in development will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which we or our marketing partners can obtain reimbursement for our products and also reimbursement at appropriate levels for the cost of our products. Obtaining reimbursement from governmental payers, insurance companies, HMOs and other third-party payers of healthcare costs is a time-consuming and expensive process. There is no guarantee that our products will ultimately be reimbursed. There is significant uncertainty concerning third-party reimbursement for the use of any pharmaceutical product incorporating new technology and third-party reimbursement might not be available for our proposed products once approved, or if obtained, might not be adequate.\nThere is significant uncertainty concerning the extent and scope of third-party reimbursement for products treating HSDD and other forms of FSD. Based on third-party reimbursement for approved products treating ED, we believe bremelanotide for HSDD will be classified as a Tier 3 drug, so that reimbursement will be limited for bremelanotide for treatment of premenopausal women with HSDD, assuming the product is approved by the FDA. If we are able to obtain reimbursement, continuing efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect our future revenues and ability to achieve profitability. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for diagnostic and therapeutic products and related services. Reimbursement from governmental payers is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, administrative rulings and other policy changes, all of which could materially decrease the range of products for which we are reimbursed or the rates of reimbursement by government payers. In addition, recent legislation reforming the healthcare system may result in lower prices or the actual inability of prospective customers to purchase our products in development. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Furthermore, even if reimbursement is available, it may not be available at price levels sufficient for us to realize a positive return on our investment, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our products in Europe, we may not be able to secure adequate pricing and reimbursement in Europe for us or any strategic partner to achieve profitability.\nEven if one or more of our products are approved in Europe, we may be unable to obtain appropriate pricing and reimbursement for such products. In most European markets, demand levels for healthcare in general and for pharmaceuticals in particular are principally regulated by national governments. Therefore, pricing and reimbursement for our products will have to be negotiated on a \u201cMember State by Member State\u201d basis according to national rules, as there does not exist a centralized European process. As each Member State has its own national rules governing pricing control and reimbursement policy for pharmaceuticals, there are likely to be uncertainties attaching to the review process, and the level of reimbursement that national governments are prepared to accept. In the current economic environment, governments and private payers or insurers are increasingly looking to contain healthcare costs, including costs on drug therapies. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing and reimbursement for our products in Europe, we or a potential strategic partner or collaborator may not be able to cover the costs necessary to manufacture, market and sell the product, limiting or preventing our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entails an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products or cease clinical trials. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with corporate collaborators. We currently carry $10 million liability insurance in the aggregate as to certain clinical trial risks, but we do not have and have not obtained quotations for commercial product liability insurance. We, or any corporate collaborators, may not in the future be able to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts, if at all. Even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We rely on industry accepted measures and technology to secure confidential and proprietary information maintained on our computer systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. While we do not believe that we have experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates which could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology, intellectual property, research and development or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we begin commercializing any of our products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase order or recommendation of, any item or services for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf\nHIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf\nHIPPA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf\nThe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n\u25cf\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations\nWe are highly dependent on our management team, senior staff professionals and third-party contractors and consultants, and the loss of their services could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our relatively small management team and staff as well as various contractors and consultants to provide critical services. Our ability to execute our clinical programs for bremelanotide and PL-3994 and our preclinical programs for MC1r and MC4r peptide drug candidates depends on our continued retention and motivation of our management and senior staff professionals, including executive officers and senior members of product development and management, including commercialization, who possess significant technical expertise and experience and oversee our development and commercialization programs. If we lose the services of existing key personnel, our development programs could be adversely affected if suitable replacement personnel are not recruited quickly. Our success also depends on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with contractors, consultants and scientific advisors.\nThere is competition for qualified personnel, contractors and consultants in the pharmaceutical industry, which makes it difficult to attract and retain the qualified personnel, contractors and consultants necessary for the development and growth of our business. Our failure to attract and retain such personnel, contractors and consultants could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we expect bremelanotide for the treatment of HSDD to be classified as a Tier 3 drug with reimbursement by third-party payers similar to approved products for treating ED, demand for this product will be tied to discretionary spending levels of our targeted patient population and particularly affected by unfavorable economic conditions.\nThe market for HSDD may be particularly vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions. We expect bremelanotide for the treatment of HSDD to have significant copay or deductible requirements and to be only partially reimbursed by third-party payers and, as a result, demand for this product may be tied to discretionary spending levels of our targeted patient population. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates, if approved, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which future economic climates and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nBoth before and after marketing approval, our product candidates are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and, if we fail to comply with these continuing requirements, we could be subject to a variety of sanctions and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.\nBoth before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion and record keeping related to the product candidates are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the products or manufacturing process;\n\u25cf\nwarning letters;\n\u25cf\ncivil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf\nfines;\n\u25cf\ninjunctions;\n\u25cf\nimposition of a Corporate Integrity Agreement requiring heightened monitoring of our compliance functions, overseen by outside monitors, and enhanced reporting requirements to, and oversight by, the FDA and other government agencies;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizures or detentions and related publicity requirements;\n\u25cf\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize us or any potential future collaborators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf\ntotal or partial suspension of production; and\n\u25cf\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new product candidates.\nChanges in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in the regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Even if the FDA approves a product candidate, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of such product, and may impose ongoing requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. The approval may also impose REMS on a product if the FDA believes there is a reason to monitor the safety of the drug in the marketplace. REMS may include requirements for additional training for health care professionals, safety communication efforts and limits on channels of distribution, among other things. The sponsor would be required to evaluate and monitor the various REMS activities and adjust them if need be. The FDA also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.\nFurthermore, the approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval varies among countries and can involve additional testing beyond that required by the FDA. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.\nIn addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained for preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we submit an application to the FDA for marketing approval of a product candidate, it may not result in marketing approval from the FDA.\nWe do not expect to receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates that are in development in the near future, if at all. The inability to obtain FDA approval or approval from comparable authorities in other countries for our product candidates would prevent us or any potential future collaborators from commercializing these product candidates in the United States or other countries.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of bremelanotide for HSDD even if the product is effective in treating HSDD.\nClinical drug development programs for our product candidates are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement and their outcome is inherently uncertain. Approval of bremelanotide for treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women requires a determination by the FDA that the product is both safe and effective. Our Phase 3 clinical trials for HSDD demonstrated what we believe to be an acceptable safety profile and statistically significant efficacy. However, the FDA may ultimately disagree with our safety analysis, definition of efficacy in HSDD, our clinical trial designs, or our interpretation of our clinical trial results. It is not possible to predict, with any assurance, whether the FDA will approve bremelanotide for any indications. The FDA may deny or delay approval of any application for bremelanotide if the FDA determines that the clinical data do not adequately establish the safety of the drug even if efficacy is established. If FDA approves bremelanotide, the approved labeling of the product may be limited or restricted in such ways as to inhibit or prevent the successful market acceptance and profitability of the product. Bremelanotide could take a significantly longer time to obtain approval than we expect and it may never gain approval. If regulatory approval of bremelanotide is delayed, limited or never obtained, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nThe regulatory approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and may prevent us from obtaining the approvals that we require.\nGovernment authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the advertising, labeling, storage, record-keeping, safety, efficacy, research, development, testing, manufacture, promotion, marketing and distribution of drug products. Drugs are subject to rigorous regulation in the United States by the FDA and similar regulatory bodies in other countries. The steps ordinarily required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States include:\n\u25cf\ncompletion of non-clinical tests including preclinical laboratory and formulation studies and animal testing and toxicology;\n\u25cf\nsubmission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin, and which may be placed on \u201cclinical hold\u201d by the FDA, meaning the trial may not commence, or must be suspended or terminated prior to completion;\n\u25cf\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled Phase 1, 2 and 3 human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication, and potentially post-approval or Phase 4 studies to further define the drug\u2019s efficacy and safety, generally or in specific patient populations;\n\u25cf\nsubmission to the FDA of an NDA that must be accompanied by a substantial \u201cuser fee\u201d payment;\n\u25cf\nFDA review and approval of the NDA before any commercial marketing or sale; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with post-approval commitments and requirements.\nSatisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements for new drugs typically takes a number of years and the actual time required for approval may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease to be treated by the drug. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, demonstrating compliance with applicable GMP requirements. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA generally has twelve months to review the application and respond to the applicant. Such response may be an approval, or may be a \u201ccomplete response letter\u201d outlining additional data or steps that must be completed prior to further FDA review of the NDA. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical trials is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, but the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of the advisory committee. The FDA may deny or delay approval of applications that do not meet applicable regulatory criteria or if the FDA determines that the clinical data do not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of the drug. Therefore, our proposed products could take a significantly longer time than we expect or may never gain approval. If regulatory approval is delayed or never obtained, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nSome of our products or product candidates, including bremelanotide, may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products or medical devices are regulated as \u201ccombination products\u201d in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. Our product candidates intended for use with such devices, or expanded indications that we may seek for our products used with such devices, may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving approval if the devices do not gain and/or maintain their own regulatory approvals or clearances. Where approval of the drug product and device is sought under a single application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay approval. In addition, because these drug delivery devices are provided by single source unaffiliated third-party companies, we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices, maintain their own regulatory compliance, and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or other regulatory clearance of the devices. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to maintain such approvals or clearances once they have been received. Failure of third-party companies to supply the devices, to successfully complete studies on the devices in a timely manner, or to obtain or maintain required approvals or clearances of the devices, and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements, could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and delays in product candidates reaching the market or in gaining approval or clearance for expanded labels for new indications.\nUpon approval, a product candidate may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved by the FDA. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the approved products in a specific subset of patients or a larger number of patients than were required for product approval and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-market studies. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to seek injunctions, levy fines and civil penalties, criminal prosecution, withdraw approvals and seize products or request recalls.\nIf regulatory approval of any of our product candidates is granted, it will be limited to certain disease states or conditions, patient populations, duration or frequency of use, and will be subject to other conditions as set forth in the FDA-approved labeling. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.\nOutside the United States, our ability to market our product candidates will also depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The foreign regulatory approval process generally includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Community (\u201cEC\u201d), registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product to more than one EC member state. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficiency has been presented, a marketing authorization will be granted. If we do not obtain, or experience difficulties in obtaining, such marketing authorizations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates and to produce, market and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress, and court decisions are issued, that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of bremelanotide for HSDD or any future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, court decisions, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted, issued or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrequire changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u25cf\nrequire recall, replacement or discontinuance of one or more of our products;\n\u25cf\nrequire additional recordkeeping;\n\u25cf\nlimit or restrict our ability to engage in certain types of marketing or promotional activities;\n\u25cf\nalter or eliminate the scope or terms of any currently available regulatory exclusivities; and\n\u25cf\nrestrict or eliminate our ability to settle any patent litigation we may bring against potential generic competitors.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in healthcare policy could adversely affect our business.\nU.S. and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (\u201cMMA\u201d), expanded Medicare coverage for drugs purchased by Medicare beneficiaries and introduced new reimbursement methodologies. In addition, this law provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. We do not know what impact the MMA and similar laws will have on the availability of coverage for and the price that we receive for any approved products. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare policies in setting their own reimbursement policies, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in similar reductions by private payers.\nThe Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (together the \u201cACA\u201d), was adopted in 2010. This law has resulted in an increase in the number of people who are covered by both public and private insurance and has changed the way health care is financed by both government health program and private insurers, with significant impacts on the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions that may impact our business and operations in ways that may negatively affect our potential revenues in the future. For example, the ACA imposes a non-deductible excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers that sell branded prescription drugs to U.S. government programs that we believe will increase the cost of any products that we develop. In addition, as part of the ACA\u2019s provisions closing a funding gap that currently exists in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d), we will be required to provide a 50% discount on any branded prescription drugs that we develop sold to beneficiaries who fall within the donut hole. We cannot predict all of the specific effects the ACA or any future healthcare reform legislation will have on our business, but they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nEfforts have been made to repeal, or repeal and replace, the ACA. It is not known whether the ACA will be repealed, amended, replaced or otherwise modified within the next several years. It is possible that any repeal, amendment or replacement of the ACA will decrease the number of people who are covered by both public and private insurance and change the way health care is financed by both government health programs and private insurers, which could significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe availability of government reimbursement for prescription drugs will be impacted by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which was signed into law on August 2, 2011. This law is expected to result in federal spending cuts totaling between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion over the next decade, over half of which will include cuts in Medicare and other health-related spending.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot predict:\n\u25cf\nthe degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents;\n\u25cf\nif and when patents will be issued;\n\u25cf\nwhether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications; and\n\u25cf\nwhether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings, which may be costly whether we win or lose.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u25cf\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf\nstop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u25cf\npay damages; or\n\u25cf\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings, which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our management resources.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property, including our patents or the patents of our licensors. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction against an infringer are not satisfied.\nAn adverse determination of any litigation or other proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference, derivation or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors or collaborators. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able, alone or with our licensors or collaborators, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or proceedings. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation or proceedings, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities may infringe or otherwise violate or be claimed to infringe or otherwise violate patents owned or controlled by other parties. There may also be patent applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued as patents, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference, derivation or post-grant proceedings declared or granted by the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign countries, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or future products. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States and in some cases may even force us to grant a compulsory license to competitors or other third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIn addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in domestic and foreign intellectual property laws.\nIf we are unable to keep our trade secrets confidential, our technologies and other proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us.\nIn addition to our reliance on patents, we attempt to protect our proprietary technologies and processes by relying on trade secret laws and agreements with our employees and other persons who have access to our proprietary information. These agreements and arrangements may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies and processes or gain access to our trade secrets or technology, either of which could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.\nRisks Related to Obligations in Our 2014 and 2015 Private Placements\nUnder agreements relating to our 2014 and 2015 private placements, we are required to allow purchasers in the 2014 and 2015 private placements to participate in certain future equity and debt financings, which may restrict our ability to raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all.\nFor four years after our 2014 and 2015 private placements, unless the FDA earlier approves bremelanotide for HSDD, the purchasers have the right of first negotiation on any subsequent equity or debt financing. If we do not agree to terms of a financing with the purchasers, depending on pricing of the financing, the purchasers have the right to purchase between 83.5% and all of the financing. We will require significant additional resources and capital for our product development programs. The right of first negotiation and right of participation granted to the purchasers in our 2014 and 2015 private placements may make it more difficult to raise additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. If we are able to obtain additional funding, such funding may not be available on acceptable terms\nUnder agreements relating to our 2014 and 2015 private placements, so long as any Series C 2014 and Series E 2015 warrants are outstanding, we are required to redeem such warrants at the option of the holders in the event of any takeover, change of control or other fundamental transaction which we permit.\nUnder the purchase agreements and forms of our Series C and Series E warrants for our 2014 and 2015 private placements, if we permit, make or allow a takeover, change of control or other fundamental transaction, including any transfer of all or substantially all of our properties or assets, then so long as any warrants remain outstanding we are required, as elected by such warrant holders, to pay such holders a warrant early termination price tied to the greater of the then market price of our common stock or the amount per share paid to any other person. The application of these provisions could adversely affect our financial position and have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or other fundamental transaction, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and could make any potential acquisition or change of control more costly.\nUnder agreements relating to our 2014 and 2015 private placements, so long as any Series C 2014 and Series E 2015 warrants are outstanding, we are required to oppose any takeover or change of control that does not provide specified rights to holders of such warrants.\nUnder the purchase agreements and forms of our Series C and Series E warrants for our 2014 and 2015 private placements, so long as any such warrants remain outstanding we are required to (i) not permit, (ii) take necessary action to prevent both the occurrence or consummation of, and (iii) not be a party to any fundamental transaction, change of control or similar event unless contractually-specified rights are provided with respect to payment of any such warrant early termination price tied to the greater of the then market price of our common stock or the amount per share paid to any other person.\nWe are also required, subject to the exercise by our board of its fiduciary duties, to take all reasonable efforts to adopt a poison pill or any other anti-takeover provision or method necessary to prevent the fundamental transaction, change of control or similar event. The application of these provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or other fundamental transaction, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and could make any potential acquisition or change of control more costly.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance and we expect it to remain volatile, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to sell stock at a profit.\nThe volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of their investment, to sell shares at a profit at any given time or to plan purchases and sales in advance. A variety of factors may affect the market price of our common stock. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\npublicity regarding actual or potential clinical results relating to products under development by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf\ndelay or failure in initiating, completing or analyzing preclinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory designs or results of these trials;\n\u25cf\ninterim decisions by regulatory agencies, including the FDA, as to clinical trial designs, acceptable safety profiles and the benefit/risk ratio of products under development;\n\u25cf\nachievement or rejection of regulatory approvals by our competitors or by us;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or by us;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning our collaborations;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf\neconomic or other crises and other external factors;\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our revenue and other results of operations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems or other actions that affect the effective reimbursement rates for treatment regimens containing our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock (or the perception that such sales could occur); and\n\u25cf\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe will not be able to control many of these factors, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance. If our revenues, if any, in any particular period do not meet expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures in that period, which could cause our operating results to suffer further. If our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may fall by a significant amount.\nFor the 12-month period ended June 30, 2017, the price of our stock has been volatile, ranging from a high of $0.90 per share to a low of $0.29 per share. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nAs a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d). We can provide no assurance that we will, at all times, in the future be able to report that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nCompanies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Section 404 requires management to establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, and annual reports on Form 10-K filed under the Exchange Act, must contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis will be a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to have effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall dramatically.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAs a smaller company, it may be difficult for us to attract or retain the interest of equity research analysts. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity of and market price of our common stock. We do not have any control of the equity research analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nHolders of our preferred stock may have interests different from our common stockholders.\nWe are permitted under our certificate of incorporation to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We can issue shares of our preferred stock in one or more series and can set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our common stockholders. 4,030 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding as of September 21, 2017. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, and such conversion could dilute the value of our common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The conversion price decreases if we sell common stock (or equivalents) for a price per share less than the conversion price or less than the market price of the common stock and is also subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, reclassification, stock dividend or stock split which results in an increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock outstanding. Upon (i) liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, (ii) sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (iii) any consolidation, merger, combination, reorganization or other transaction in which the Company is not the surviving entity or in which the shares of common stock constituting in excess of 50% of the voting power of the Company are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Company, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, pro rata and in preference to the holders of any other capital stock, an amount per share equal to $100 plus accrued but unpaid dividends, if any. Any preferred stock that we issue may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and intend to retain future earnings, if any, for the development and expansion of our business. Our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, consisting of 4,030 shares on September 21, 2017, provides that we may not pay a dividend or make any distribution to holders of any class of stock unless we first pay a special dividend or distribution of $100 per share to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the terms of existing or future agreements may limit our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents may make potential acquisitions more difficult and could result in the entrenchment of management.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents may make a change in control or efforts to remove management more difficult. Also, under Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock. To the extent that we sell or otherwise issue authorized but currently unissued shares, this could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nOur charter authorizes us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. If we exercise this right, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nIn addition, our equity incentive plans generally permit us to accelerate the vesting of options and other stock rights granted under these plans in the event of a change of control. If we accelerate the vesting of options or other stock rights, this action could make an acquisition more costly.\nThe application of these provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. Smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs of September 21, 2017 there were 57,174,292 shares of common stock underlying outstanding convertible preferred stock, options, restricted stock units and warrants. Stockholders may experience dilution from the conversion of preferred stock, exercise of outstanding options and warrants and vesting of restricted stock units.\nAs of September 21, 2017, holders of our outstanding dilutive securities had the right to acquire the following amounts of underlying common stock:\n\u25cf\n60,592 shares issuable on the conversion of immediately convertible Series A Convertible preferred stock, subject to adjustment, for no further consideration;\n\u25cf\n8,977,812 shares issuable on the exercise of stock options, at exercise prices ranging from $0.37 to $6.60 per share;\n\u25cf\n5,263,617 shares issuable under restricted stock units which vest on dates between December 8, 2017 and September 7, 2021, subject to the fulfillment of service conditions; and\n\u25cf\n42,872,271 shares issuable on the exercise of warrants at exercise prices ranging from $0.01 to $0.91 per share, of which 16,472,418 are prefunded warrants with an exercise price of $0.01.\nIf the holders convert, exercise or receive these securities, or similar dilutive securities we may issue in the future, stockholders may experience dilution in the net book value of their common stock. In addition, the sale or availability for sale of the underlying shares in the marketplace could depress our stock price. We have registered or agreed to register for resale substantially all of the underlying shares listed above. Holders of registered underlying shares could resell the shares immediately upon issuance, which could result in significant downward pressure on our stock price.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nOur common shares are listed on the NYSE MKT, a national securities exchange, under the symbol \u201cPTN\u201d. Although we currently meet the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing standards, which generally mandate that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders\u2019 equity, market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to meet the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing requirements. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, the NYSE MKT may take steps to de-list our common stock. If the NYSE MKT delists our securities for trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf\na determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nSuch a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we may take actions to restore our compliance with the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NYSE MKT minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing requirements.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Our common shares are considered to be covered securities because they are listed on the NYSE MKT. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE MKT, our common stock would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.", "PERMNO": 79702, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTN"}
