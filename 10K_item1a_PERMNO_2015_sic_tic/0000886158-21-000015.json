{"cik": "886158", "company": "BED BATH & BEYOND INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nMACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\nGeneral economic factors beyond our control, including the impact of COVID-19, and changes in the economic climate could adversely affect, and have materially adversely affected, our performance.\nGeneral economic factors that are beyond our control could impact our forecasts and actual performance. These factors include, but are not limited to, housing markets, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters such as pandemics, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, conditions affecting the retail environment for products sold by us and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences. Changes in the economic climate and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially adversely affected, and could continue to materially adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, national and local governments in regions in which we operate have enacted various measures, including travel restrictions or bans, restrictions on events and gatherings and various other \u201csocial distancing\u201d recommendations. In response to COVID-19, we temporarily closed all retail store locations as of March 23, 2020 (other than BABY and Harmon Face Values stores). On May 8, 2020, we announced a phased approach to re-open a number of stores, subject to state and local regulations, and nearly all of our stores have reopened (sometimes in a limited capacity) as of July 2020. Despite the gradual re-opening of stores, the extent, severity and overall duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its recent resurgence, and the temporary store closures have resulted in significant continuing uncertainty, and the overall impact of COVID-19 may continue to materially and adversely impact our business and could also result in the recording of additional non-cash impairment charges. In future periods, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by reduced store traffic and consumer spending due to, among other things, significant continued unemployment and economic downturn, as well as consumer anxiety regarding shopping in physical stores. We could also suffer reputational harm or other potential liability if we were to experience widespread transmission of COVID-19 at one or more of our stores or other facilities.\nThe impacts and potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic that could directly or indirectly materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity also include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Potential failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, commercial banks and other external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, or by travel restrictions and border closures;\n\u2022Negative impact on our employees. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel and work locations, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences and a furlough of the majority of store associates and a portion of corporate associates, nearly all of whom have returned as of the third quarter of fiscal 2020), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees;\n\u2022Potential impact on our ability to meet our obligations to business partners, including under our secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Facility\"), which contains a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, and under our current lease obligations. We have renegotiated and continue to renegotiate payment terms for goods, services and rent. Similar to other retailers, we have also withheld portions of and/or delayed payments to certain of our business partners as we negotiate revisions to our payment terms, in order to further maintain liquidity given the temporary store closures. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate payment terms with all such business partners, and the ultimate outcome of these activities, including the responses of all business partners, are not yet known;\n\u2022Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for our products, which have been and may continue to be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of consumers to shop at our stores or buy our\nproducts due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, unemployment or other financial hardship, and shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products; and\n\u2022Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock and availability and cost of credit, which could negatively affect our liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, and the extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economy and us will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, including the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and, in part, on the size and effectiveness of the compensating measures taken by governments. We are closely monitoring the potential effects and impact on our business, operations, financial condition and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage, though the extent is difficult to fully predict at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on our business, see \"Item 1 - Business - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\nWe operate in the highly competitive retail business where the use of emerging technologies as well as unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of competitors may adversely affect our performance.\nThe retail business is highly competitive. We compete for customers, employees, locations, merchandise, technology, services and other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional and national retailers. These competitors range from specialty retailers to department stores and discounters as well as online and multichannel retailers, some of which are larger than us with significantly greater financial resources. In recent years, competition has further intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity and deep price discounting.\nRapidly evolving technologies are also altering the manner in which we and our competitors communicate and transact with customers. Our execution of the elements of our transformation strategy is designed to adapt to these changes, in the context of competitors\u2019 actions, customers' adoption of new technology and related changes in customer behavior, and presents a specific risk in the event that we are unable to successfully execute our plans or adjust them over time as needed. Further, unanticipated changes in pricing and other practices of our competitors, including promotional activity (particularly during holiday periods), reduced thresholds for free shipping and rapid price fluctuation enabled by technology, may adversely affect our performance. If we are unable to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape and maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our merchandise, reduced sales and margins, inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and loss of market share. For more information on our strategy, see \"Item 1 - Business - Strategy.\"\nOur failure to anticipate and respond in a timely fashion to changes in consumer preferences and demographic factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends, customer demands and demographics in order to maintain and attract customers. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, shopping and spending patterns and other life interest decisions, including as a result of COVID-19, could lead to, among other things, excess inventories or a shortage of products and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must manage our inventory effectively and commensurately with customer demand. Often, we need to order merchandise, and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacturing of such merchandise, multiple seasons in advance of and frequently before customer trends and preferences are known. The extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing trends and preferences. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases. If we do not accurately predict our customers\u2019 preferences and demands for our products, our inventory levels will not be appropriate, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and revenues historically realized during the back to school and holiday seasons. We must carry a significant amount of inventory during this time, and if we are not able to sell the inventory, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. Similarly, if we do not adequately stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back to school and holiday seasons, and fail to meet customer demand, revenue and customer loyalty may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, our financial results during the holiday season may fluctuate significantly based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nSTRATEGY RISKS\nWe may face challenges in executing our omnichannel strategy and expanding our operations to ecommerce.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we began executing on elements of our new growth strategy, which we comprehensively communicated during our October 2020 Investor Day. Our ability to implement our strategic direction is based on a number of key assumptions regarding the future economic environment and our ability to meet certain ambitions, goals and targets, among other things. If any of these assumptions (including but not limited to our ability to meet certain ambitions, goals and targets) prove inaccurate in whole or in part, our ability to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of this strategy could be limited, including our ability to meet our stated financial objectives and retain key employees. Factors beyond our control, including but not limited to market and economic conditions, execution risk related to the implementation of our strategy and other challenges and risk factors discussed in this annual report, could limit our ability to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of this strategy. If we are unable to implement this strategy successfully in whole or in part or should the components of the strategy that are implemented fail to produce the expected benefits, our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, an important part of our strategy involves providing customers with a seamless omnichannel shopping experience. Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are increasingly using technology to compare and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our omnichannel strategy, and our ability to compete and meet customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology and omnichannel experiences. Consequently, our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance could be materially adversely affected. For more information on our strategy, see \"Item 1 - Business - Strategy.\"\nSuccessful execution of our omnichannel strategy is dependent, in part, on our ability to establish and profitably maintain the appropriate mix of digital and physical presence in the markets we serve.\nSuccessful execution of our omnichannel strategy depends, in part, on our ability to develop our digital capabilities in conjunction with optimizing our physical store operations and market coverage, while maintaining profitability. Our ability to develop these capabilities will depend on a number of factors, including our assessment and implementation of emerging technologies and our ability to manage the rapid increase in online orders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our ability to drive store traffic upon the expected return of in-person shopping. Our ability to optimize our store operations and market coverage requires active management of our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time, which to the extent it involves the relocation of existing stores or the opening of additional stores will depend on a number of factors, including our identification and availability of suitable locations; our success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms; and our timely development of new stores, including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays based on weather or other events. These factors could potentially increase the cost of doing business and the risk that our business practices could result in liabilities that may adversely affect our performance, despite the exercise of reasonable care.\nThere are risks associated with our store network optimization strategies, pursuant to which we plan to close approximately 200 mostly BBB stores by the end of fiscal 2021.\nAs part of our ongoing business transformation, our Board approved the planned closure of approximately 200 mostly BBB stores by the end of fiscal 2021 as part of our store network optimization program. In connection with this program, we expect to incur one-time costs, including contract termination costs, employee-related costs, professional fees and non-cash impairment charges, which cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. We may not be able to complete the planned store closures in the timeframe, on the terms or in the manner it expects. In addition, the announced program involves numerous risks, including, without limitation, the diversion of our attention from our businesses and operations. If these or other factors impair our ability to successfully implement the program, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the program, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. As of February 27, 2021, 144 of the BBB stores have been closed.\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.\nWe continually assess shareholder value and strategic fit of our existing businesses, and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired shareholder value or return on investment. Such transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including, but not limited to, not being able to achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits or obtain satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all. Even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business, the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share or adversely impact corporate overhead contribution/allocation associated with divested brands, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management or result in disputes with buyers. We may also be required to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities related to any businesses we have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies may have a material effect on our financial statements.\nIn addition, uncertainty about the effect of any potential divestiture on employees, business partners, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause business partners, suppliers, vendors and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. In addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of any potential divestiture, our business could be harmed. If we are unable to divest any such businesses, we may not be able to find another buyer on the same terms and will continue to be subject to the risks of operating such businesses. For more information on our strategy and recent divestitures, see \"Item 1 - Business.\"\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nA major disruption of our information technology systems could negatively impact results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by a major disruption of our information technology systems. We rely heavily on these systems to process transactions, manage inventory replenishment, summarize results and control distribution of products. Despite numerous safeguards and careful contingency planning, these systems are still subject to power outages, telecommunication failures, cybercrimes, cybersecurity attacks and other catastrophic events. Our information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from COVID-19, including, for example, the significant increase in remote working of our employees and the increase in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations. A major disruption of the systems and their backup mechanisms may cause us to incur significant costs to repair the systems, experience a critical loss of data and/or result in business interruptions.\nA breach of our data security systems or those of our third-party service providers could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial performance due to possible loss of consumer confidence, as well as potential government penalties and private litigation.\nWe process, transmit, store and maintain certain information about our customers and employees in the ordinary course of business. In connection with certain activities, including, without limitation credit card processing, website hosting, data encryption and software support, we utilize third party service providers, and we believe we take appropriate steps to require such providers to secure such information and to assess their ability to do so. We invest considerable resources in protecting this sensitive information but are still subject to a possible security event, including but not limited to cybercrimes or cybersecurity attacks which may not be detected for a period of time. A breach of our security systems or those of our third-party service providers resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information could negatively impact our reputation, results of operations and financial performance. Certain aspects of the business, particularly our websites, depend heavily on consumers entrusting personal financial information to be transmitted securely over public networks. A loss of consumer confidence from such a breach could result in lost future sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation. In addition, a breach or other type of cybercrime or cybersecurity attack could cause us to incur significant costs to restore the integrity of our data and systems, could require the devotion of significant management resources and could result in significant government penalties and private litigation.\nIn particular, in connection with COVID-19, there has been a spike in cybersecurity attacks as shelter in place orders and work from home measures have led businesses to increase reliance on virtual environments and communications systems, which have been subjected to increasing third-party vulnerabilities and security risks. Malicious hackers may attempt to gain access to our network or data centers; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. Although we monitor our networks and continue to enhance our\nsecurity protections, hackers are increasingly more sophisticated and aggressive, and our efforts may be inadequate to prevent all incidents of data breach or theft.\nIn October 2019, we discovered that a third party acquired e-mail and password information from a source outside of our systems that was used to access less than 1% of our online customer accounts. On October 29, 2019, we sent notifications to certain customers as required by applicable legal requirements. None of our online customers\u2019 payment cards were compromised as a result of this incident. Since becoming aware of this incident, we retained a leading security forensics firm and have implemented remedial measures.\nDamage to our reputation in any aspect of our operations could potentially impact our operating and financial results.\nOur reputation is based, in part, on perceptions of subjective qualities, so incidents involving us, our products or the retail industry in general that erode customer trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business. As we increase the number of items available to be shipped directly from a vendor to a customer for home delivery or in-home assembly, any deficiencies in the performance of these third party merchandise vendors and service providers could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation, despite our monitoring controls and procedures. In addition, challenges to our compliance with a variety of social, product, labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and lead to adverse publicity, especially in social media. The use of social media by us and consumers has also increased the risk that our reputation could be negatively impacted. The availability of information and opinion on social media is immediate, as is its impact. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinion, is virtually limitless. Information about or affecting us is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated.\nDamage to our brand and reputation could potentially impact our operating and financial results, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on managing costs of labor, merchandise and other expenses that are subject to factors beyond our control.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, labor organizing activities and changing demographics. Our ability to find qualified merchandise vendors and service providers and obtain access to products in a timely and efficient manner can be adversely affected by trade restrictions, political instability, financial instability of suppliers, suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, transportation costs, disruptions to our supply chain network serving our stores, distribution facilities and customers due to labor disturbances and other items, and other factors beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temporary store closures and employee furloughs.\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nDisruption of our supply chain capabilities due to trade restrictions, port-related issues such as closures, congestion or delays, political instability, weather, natural disaster, pandemics (including COVID-19), terrorism, product recalls, labor supply or stoppages, financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, it could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on the ability of our employees in all areas of the organization to execute our business plan and, ultimately, to satisfy our customers.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of the organization may be affected by a number of factors, including geographic relocation of employees, operations or facilities and the highly competitive markets in which we operate, including the markets for the types of skilled individuals needed to support our continued success.\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn particular, our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. If key employees terminate their employment, become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and our management team's attention may be diverted. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnusual weather patterns could adversely affect our performance.\nOur operating results could be negatively impacted by unusual weather patterns. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms, hurricanes, floods, tornados or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our performance.\nCAPITAL RISKS\nDisruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to access our cash and cash equivalents.\nWe may have amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. While we closely manage our cash and cash equivalents balances to minimize risk, if there were disruptions in the financial markets or continue to be disruptions in the financial markets due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits, and it may negatively impact the availability and cost of capital.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be subject to volatility, and this and other factors may affect elements of our capital allocation strategy such as share repurchases, future dividends and debt reduction.\nOur stock price has experienced volatility over time and this volatility may continue, in part due to factors such as those mentioned in this Item 1A. Stock volatility in itself may adversely affect shareholder confidence as well as employee morale and retention for those associates who receive equity grants as part of their compensation packages. The impact on employee morale and retention could adversely affect our business performance and financial results. Stock volatility and other factors may also affect elements of our capital allocation strategy, and our ability to use equity to fund acquisitions or raise capital.\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, since December 2004, our Board of Directors has authorized several share repurchase programs, and in April 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend program. Decisions regarding share repurchases and dividends are within the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will be influenced by a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, general business and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, the emergence of alternative investment or acquisition opportunities, changes in business strategy and other factors. Changes in, or the elimination of, our share repurchase programs or dividend could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our share repurchase program could change, and would be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our stock price. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we postponed our plans for share repurchases and suspended the payment of dividends and planned debt reductions. We recommenced share repurchase programs on October 28, 2020 and also entered into accelerated share repurchase programs on October 28, 2020 and January 7, 2021 (as amended on January 29, 2021), totaling $375.0 million. For more information on our dividends and share repurchase programs, see \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nOur business would be adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations.\nWe have incurred indebtedness under senior unsecured notes and have entered into the ABL Facility. Our ability to pay interest and principal when due, comply with debt covenants or repurchase the senior unsecured notes if a change of control occurs, will depend upon, among other things, sales and cash flow levels and other factors that affect our future financial and operating performance, including prevailing economic conditions and financial and business factors, many of which are beyond our control. Given the current economic environment, and the continuing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, we may be unable to maintain compliance with the springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL Facility in future periods, to the extent the covenant is applicable under the terms of the ABL Facility, which would result in an event of default under the ABL Facility and could, at the direction of the requisite lenders, result in the acceleration of the obligation to repay the outstanding amounts thereunder if not waived by the applicable lenders.\nIf we become unable in the future to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service requirements, we may be forced to take remedial actions such as restructuring or refinancing our debt; seeking additional debt or equity capital; reducing or delaying our business activities, or selling assets. There can be no assurance that any such measures would be successful.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nChanges in statutory, regulatory, and other legal requirements at a local, state or provincial and national level, or deemed noncompliance with such requirements, could potentially impact our operating and financial results.\nWe are subject to numerous statutory, regulatory and legal requirements at a local, state or provincial and national level, and this regulatory environment is subject to constant change. Our operating results could be negatively impacted by developments in these areas due to the costs of compliance in addition to possible government penalties and litigation in the event of deemed noncompliance. Changes in the law or the regulatory environment in the areas of customer, employee or product safety, environmental protection, privacy and information security, wage and hour laws, and international trade policy, among others, could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nChanges to accounting rules, regulations and tax laws, or new interpretations of existing accounting standards or tax laws could negatively impact our operating results and financial position.\nOur operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by changes to accounting rules and regulations or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. Our effective income tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting standards as well as changes in tax laws or the interpretations of these tax laws by courts and taxing authorities which could negatively impact our financial results. Such changes would include for example, the possible adoption by the United States of additional tariffs, or the disallowance of tax deductions, with respect to imported merchandise.\nNew, or developments in existing, litigation, claims or assessments could potentially impact our reputation, operating and financial results.\nWe are involved in litigation, claims and assessments incidental to our business, the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on our reputation, financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected by changes in our assumptions related to these matters. While outcomes of such actions vary, any such claim or assessment against us could negatively impact our reputation, operations and financial results.\nA failure of our suppliers to adhere to appropriate laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact our reputation.\nWe purchase substantially all of our merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources (who may manufacture overseas) and the balance from importers. We purchase a small amount of our merchandise directly from overseas sources. The failure of one of our domestic or foreign suppliers to adhere to labor, environmental, privacy, health and safety laws, regulations and standards could negatively impact our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 77659, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "BBBY"}
