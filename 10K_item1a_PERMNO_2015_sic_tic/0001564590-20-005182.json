{"cik": "1090012", "company": "DEVON ENERGY CORP/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the following risks should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted. As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Devon.\nVolatile Oil, Gas and NGL Prices Significantly Impact Our Business\nOur financial condition, results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities. Historically, market prices and our realized prices have been volatile. For example, over the last five years, NYMEX WTI oil and NYMEX Henry Hub prices ranged from highs of over $75 per Bbl and $4.80 per MMBtu, respectively, to lows of under $27 per Bbl and $1.70 per MMBtu, respectively. Such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nvolatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;\n\u2022\nconservation and environmental protection efforts;\n\u2022\nproduction levels of members of OPEC, Russia, the U.S. or other producing countries;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical risks, including political and civil unrest in the Middle East, Africa and South America;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters, public health crises and other catastrophic events, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and epidemics of infectious diseases;\n\u2022\nregional pricing differentials, including in the Delaware Basin and other areas of our operations;\n\u2022\ndiffering quality of production, including NGL content of gas produced;\n\u2022\nthe level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs and the level of global oil, gas and NGL inventories;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and production, including with respect to electric vehicles;\n\u2022\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;\n\u2022\nthe overall economic environment;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade relations and policies, including the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. or China; and\n\u2022\nother governmental regulations and taxes.\nEstimates of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves Are Uncertain and May Be Subject to Revision\nThe process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors, including additional development and appraisal activity, the viability of production under varying economic conditions, including commodity price declines, and variations in production levels and associated costs. Consequently, material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such revisions to proved reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties, as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability. Our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties\u201d of this report.\nDiscoveries or Acquisitions of Reserves Are Needed to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production\nThe production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Moreover, our current development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets, which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets. Therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities, such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells, utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.\nOur Operations Are Uncertain and Involve Substantial Costs and Risks\nOur operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling for oil, gas and NGLs can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. While both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. In addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, as well as the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and extreme temperatures;\n\u2022\nissues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022\nrestricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards or liabilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. Moreover, certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources. For example, we have from time to time experienced well-control events that have resulted in various remediation and clean-up costs and certain of the other impacts described above.\nIn addition, we rely on our employees, consultants and sub-contractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards. Any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals, whether through negligence, harassment, discrimination or other misconduct, could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business. For example, negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury, death or property damage, and sexual harassment or racial and gender discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm.\nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation, Which Can Change and Could Adversely Impact Our Business\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and NGLs, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations. If permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. In addition, we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders. For example, certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators, including corporate successors of former operators. These requirements may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions.\nIn addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. Regulatory and public policy developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies. Our operating and\nother compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. In addition, changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by, among other things, increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty. For example, changes in U.S. trade relations, particularly the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and China, may increase the cost of materials we or our vendors use, thereby increasing our operating expense. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing, environmental matters more generally, seismic activity and income taxes, as discussed below.\nHydraulic Fracturing - In recent years, various federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA has issued regulations under the federal Clean Air Act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and it finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA also released a report in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing, such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices, could result in impacts to water resources. The BLM previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017. Moreover, several states in which we operate have adopted, or stated intentions to adopt, laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, such as requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular.\nBeyond these regulatory efforts, various policy makers, regulatory agencies and political candidates at the federal, state and local levels have proposed implementing even further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including prohibiting the technology outright. For example, certain candidates running to be elected President of the United States in 2020 have pledged to impose a ban on hydraulic fracturing. It is possible that any such restrictions may particularly target industry activity on federal lands, which could adversely impact our operations in the Delaware and Powder River Basins, as well as other areas where we operate under federal leases. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 20% of our total leasehold resides on federal lands, and approximately 40% and 60% of our leasehold in the Delaware and Powder River Basins, respectively, resides on federal lands. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals, any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations.\nEnvironmental Laws Generally - In addition to regulatory efforts focused on hydraulic fracturing, we are subject to various other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Any such changes could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\nSeismic Activity - Earthquakes in northern and central Oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the oil and gas industry. Legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In addition, we are currently defending against certain third-party lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims, seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation.\nChanges to Tax Laws - We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions, and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits. Changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow.\nConcerns About Climate Change and Related Regulatory, Social and Market Actions May Adversely Affect Our Business\nContinuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives, including international agreements, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases. For example, both the EPA and the BLM have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, for the oil and gas industry. Following the change in presidential administrations, however, the agencies have attempted to revise or rescind their previously issued methane standards. Litigation concerning these methane regulations and subsequent attempts to revise or rescind them is ongoing. Nevertheless, several states where we operate, including Wyoming and New Mexico, have already imposed, or stated intentions to impose, laws or regulations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. With respect to more comprehensive regulation, policy makers and political candidates have made, or expressed support for, a variety of proposals, such as the development of cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs, as well as the more sweeping \u201cgreen new deal\u201d resolutions introduced in Congress in early 2019. As generally proposed, a cap-and-trade program would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances, while a carbon tax could impose taxes based on emissions from our operations and downstream uses of our products. The \u201cgreen new deal\u201d resolutions call for a 10-year national mobilization effort to, among other things, transition 100% of power demand in the U.S. to zero-emission sources and overhaul transportation systems in the U.S. to remove greenhouse gas emissions as much as is technologically feasible.\nIn addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives resulting from the changing perception of climate change present risks for our business. For example, in an effort to promote a lower-carbon economy, there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing the development and adoption of alternative energy sources and technologies, including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. These initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. Moreover, certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have begun restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change. Such restrictions in capital could decrease the value of our business and make it more difficult to fund our operations. Finally, governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought, and may continue to bring, claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change. These and the other regulatory, social and market risks relating to climate change described above could result in unexpected costs, increase our operating expense and reduce the demand for our products, which in turn could lower the value of our reserves and have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur Hedging Activities Limit Participation in Commodity Price Increases and Involve Other Risks\nWe enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and NGL price volatility. To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts. Moreover, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other legislation and regulation, hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking, some of which is ongoing, existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements.\nThe Credit Risk of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Us\nWe enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk. For example, we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements, our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies. Disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.\nIn addition, we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade, joint interest billing and other receivables. We sell our oil, gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers, and, as an operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective share of costs. We also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us or our predecessors to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets, including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells. Certain of these counterparties or their successors may experience insolvency, liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) owed to, and assumed from, us, particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment. Any such default may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities, which could adversely impact our financial results and condition.\nOur Debt May Limit Our Liquidity and Financial Flexibility, and Any Downgrade of Our Credit Rating Could Adversely Impact Us\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $4.3 billion. Our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to debt service payments, thereby limiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including low commodity price environments; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing due to higher costs and more restrictive covenants.\nIn addition, we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the U.S. with respect to our debt. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include, among others, debt levels, planned asset sales and purchases, liquidity, forecasted production growth and commodity prices. We are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements. Any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit, require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt.\nCyber Attacks May Adversely Impact Our Operations\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, and we anticipate expanding the use of technology in our operations, including through artificial intelligence, process automation and data analytics. Concurrent with this growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyber attack related activities, which have frequently targeted our industry. Cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating sensitive information, intellectual property or financial assets, corrupting data or causing operational disruptions as well as to prevent users from accessing systems or information and demand payment in order to regain access. These attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders. Techniques used in these attacks often range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. Cyber attacks may also be performed in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks. In addition, our vendors, midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks, which, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. Although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date, if we were successfully attacked, we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences, including litigation risks. Moreover, as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities.\nWe Have Limited Control Over Properties Operated by Others\nCertain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. We have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays, curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMidstream Capacity Constraints and Interruptions Impact Commodity Sales\nWe rely on midstream facilities and systems owned and operated by others to process our gas production and to transport our oil, gas and NGL production to downstream markets. All or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants, pipelines or gathering systems. Such access could be lost due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions and natural disasters, accidents, field labor issues or strikes. Additionally, the midstream operators may be subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct, maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production. Such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability.\nInsurance Does Not Cover All Risks\nAs discussed above, our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, gas and NGLs. To mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards, we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages, loss of well control, business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental. We also maintain workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability insurance. However, our insurance coverage does not provide 100% reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards. Additionally, we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks, including pollution events that are considered gradual, war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.\nCompetition for Assets, Materials, People and Capital Can Be Significant\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties. Typically, during times of rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. During these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget. Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic long-term positions and relationships, including with respect to midstream take-away capacity. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations.\nOur Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Investors Attempting to Effect Change\nStockholder activism has been increasing in our industry, and investors may from time to time attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by stockholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our board of directors and employees from core business operations, requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs, interfering with our ability to successfully execute on strategic transactions and plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business. Such perceived uncertainty may, in turn, make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock.\nOur Acquisition and Divestiture Activities Involve Substantial Risks\nOur business depends, in part, on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses. If we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions, they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmistaken estimates or assumptions about reserves, potential drilling locations, revenues and costs, including synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or business; and\n\u2022\nunknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity. These transactions also have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. Moreover, volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing.", "PERMNO": 87137, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DVN"}
