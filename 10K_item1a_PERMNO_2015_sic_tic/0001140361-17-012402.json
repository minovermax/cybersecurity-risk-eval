{"cik": "876343", "company": "BIOTIME INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described below. You should consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, our business prospects, and financial condition, and the value of an investment in our business. There may be other factors that are not mentioned here or of which we are not presently aware that could also affect our business operations and prospects. Those of our subsidiaries and other affiliates within the BioTime Family of Companies that are developing therapeutic products derived from pluripotent stem cells will face substantially the same kind of risks that affect our business, as well as the risks related to our industry generally.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and we do not know if we will attain profitability\nOur total operating losses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $59 million, $65.8 million, and $50.7 million respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $196 million, as of December 31, 2016. We primarily finance our operations through the sale of equity securities, research grants, licensing fees, royalties on product sales by our licensees, and subscription fees and advertising revenue from database products. Ultimately, our ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to earn a profit depends upon our success in developing and marketing or licensing our products, diagnostic tests, and technology. As a developer of therapeutic products derived from pluripotent stem cells, Asterias will face substantially the same kind of risks that affect our business, as well as the risks related to our industry generally.\nWe will spend a substantial amount of our capital on research and development but we might not succeed in developing products and technologies that are useful in medicine\n\u25cf\nMany of our experimental products and technologies have not been applied in human medicine and have only been used in laboratory studies in vitro or in animals. These new products and technologies might not prove to be safe and efficacious in the human medical applications for which they were developed.\n\u25cf\nThe experimentation we are doing is costly, time consuming, and uncertain as to its results. We incurred research and development expenses amounting to $36.1 million, $42.6 million, and $37.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\n\u25cf\nIf we are successful in developing a new technology or product, refinement of the new technology or product and definition of the practical applications and limitations of the technology or product may take years and require the expenditure of large sums of money. We may not have the financial resources to fund clinical trials on our own and we may have to enter into licensing or collaborative arrangements with other companies or we may discontinue one or more of the research or product development programs. Any such arrangements may be dilutive to our ownership or economic interest in the products.\nSales of the products we may develop will be adversely impacted by the availability of competing products\n\u25cf\nSales of Hextend\u00ae have already been adversely impacted by the availability of other products that are commonly used in surgery and trauma care and sell at low prices.\n\u25cf\nOcata, which was recently acquired by a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma, Inc. for $379 million, is conducting clinical trials of a pluripotent stem cell product designed to treat AMD. If the Ocata product is proven to be safe and effective, it may reach the market ahead of OpRegen\u00ae Moreover, Ocata was recently issued a patent pertaining to the manufacture of RPE products that could adversely impact the rights of Cell Cure to manufacture OpRegen\u00ae.\n\u25cf\nPhysicians and hospitals may be reluctant to try a new product due to the high degree of risk associated with the application of new technologies and products in the field of human medicine.\n\u25cf\nThere also is a risk that our competitors may succeed at developing safer or more effective products that could render our products and technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses\n\u25cf\nWe and the other members of the BioTime Family of Companies, including Asterias and OncoCyte, plan to continue to incur substantial research and product development expenses and will need to raise additional capital to pay operating expenses.\n\u25cf\nThe ability of BioTime, Asterias and OncoCyte to raise additional equity or debt capital will depend, not only on progress made in developing new products and technologies, but also on access to capital and conditions in the capital markets. There is no assurance that we or Asterias and OncoCyte will be able to raise capital at times and in amounts needed to finance product development, clinical trials, and general operations. Even if capital is available, it may not be available on terms that we or our shareholders would consider favorable.\n\u25cf\nSales of additional equity securities by us or our subsidiaries could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders.\nAny cell-based products that receive regulatory approval may be difficult and expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale\n\u25cf\npluripotent stem derived therapeutic cells have only been produced on a small scale and not in quantities and at levels of purity and viability that will be needed for wide scale commercialization. If we are successful in developing products that consist of pluripotent stem cells or other cells or products derived from pluripotent stem or other cells, we will need to develop processes and technology for the commercial production of those products.\n\u25cf\npluripotent stem cell or other cell based products are likely to be more expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale than most other drugs on the market today. The high cost of manufacturing a product will require that we charge our customers a high price for the product in order to cover our costs and earn a profit. If the price of our products is too high, hospitals and physicians may be reluctant to purchase our products. We may not be able to sell our products in sufficient volumes to recover our costs or to earn a profit.\nWe will have certain obligations and may incur liabilities arising from clinical trials, and we do not yet know the scope of any resulting expenses that might arise\nWe face the risk of incurring liabilities to clinical trial patients if they incur any injuries as a result of their participation in the clinical trials. We will also be obligated to obtain information and prepare reports about the health of the clinical trial patients. We are not aware of any claims by patients alleging injuries suffered as a result of any of our clinical trials, but if any claims are made and if liability can be established, the amount of any liability that we or our subsidiaries may incur, could exceed any insurance coverage that we or our subsidiaries may obtain, and the amount of the liability could be material to our financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend\nBioTime stem cell research programs, and to a lesser extent, the programs of BioTime\u2019s subsidiaries, are directed primarily by our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Dr. Michael West and Adi Mohanty. BioTime\u2019s subsidiaries are directed by their respective management teams. The loss of the services of Dr. West, Mr. Mohanty or other members of senior management of BioTime or of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we make strategic acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and might never realize the anticipated benefits\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we might attempt to acquire approved products, additional drug candidates, technologies, or businesses that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. If we pursue any transaction of that sort, the process of negotiating the acquisition and integrating an acquired product, drug candidate, technology, or business might result in operating difficulties and expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. Moreover, we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Our growth and entry into new products, technologies and markets will place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Operating our business through subsidiaries, some of which are located in foreign countries, also adds to the complexity of our internal control over financial reporting and adds to the risk of a system failure, an undetected improper use or expenditure of funds or other resources by a subsidiary, or a failure to properly report a transaction or financial results of a subsidiary. We allocate certain expenses among BioTime itself and one or more of our subsidiaries, which creates a risk that the allocations we make may not accurately reflect the benefit of an expenditure or use of financial or other resources by BioTime as the parent company and the subsidiaries among which the allocations are made. An inaccurate allocation may impact our consolidated financial results, particularly in the case of subsidiaries that we do not wholly own since our financial statements include adjustments to reflect the minority ownership interests in our subsidiaries held by others.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of computer system failures\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe will face certain risks arising from regulatory, legal, and economic factors that affect our business and the business of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical development companies. Because we are a small company with limited revenues and limited capital resources, we may be less able to bear the financial impact of these risks than is the case with larger companies possessing substantial income and available capital.\nIf we do not receive regulatory approvals we will not be permitted to sell our therapeutic and medical device products\nThe therapeutic and medical device products that we and our subsidiaries develop cannot be sold until the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities approve the products for medical use. The need to obtain regulatory approval to market a new product means that:\n\u25cf\nWe will have to conduct expensive and time-consuming clinical trials of new products. The full cost of conducting and completing clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of a new product cannot be presently determined, but could exceed our current financial resources.\n\u25cf\nClinical trials and the regulatory approval process for a pharmaceutical or cell-based product can take several years to complete. As a result, we will incur the expense and delay inherent in seeking FDA and foreign regulatory approval of new products, even if the results of clinical trials are favorable.\n\u25cf\nData obtained from preclinical and clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations and regulatory changes that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory agency approvals.\n\u00b7\nBecause the therapeutic products we are developing with pluripotent stem cell technology involve the application of new technologies and approaches to medicine, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject those products to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologicals derived from other technologies.\n\u25cf\nA product that is approved may be subject to restrictions on use.\n\u25cf\nThe FDA can recall or withdraw approval of a product, if it deems necessary.\n\u25cf\nWe will face similar regulatory issues in foreign countries.\nClinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future product candidates\nClinical trial failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndelays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining institutional review board (IRB) and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nslower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u25cf\nnegative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen side effects, possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\napproval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u25cf\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u25cf\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u25cf\nunavailability of clinical trial supplies.\nGovernment-imposed bans or restrictions and religious, moral, and ethical concerns about the use of hES cells could prevent us from developing and successfully marketing stem cell products\nGovernment-imposed bans or restrictions on the use of embryos or hES cells in research and development in the United States and abroad could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for our products. During March 2009, President Obama lifted certain restrictions on federal funding of research involving the use of hES cells, and in accordance with President Obama\u2019s Executive Order, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has adopted new guidelines for determining the eligibility of hES cell lines for use in federally funded research. The central focus of the proposed guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. The hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.\nCalifornia law requires that stem cell research be conducted under the oversight of a stem cell review oversight committee (SCRO). Many kinds of stem cell research, including the derivation of new hES cell lines, may only be conducted in California with the prior written approval of the SCRO. A SCRO could prohibit or impose restrictions on the research that we plan to do.\nThe use of hES cells may give rise to religious, moral, and ethical issues. These considerations could lead to more restrictive government regulations or could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for our products.\nIf we are unable to obtain and enforce patents and to protect our trade secrets, others could use our technology to compete with us, which could limit opportunities for us to generate revenues by licensing our technology and selling products\n\u25cf\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secrets in the United States and in other countries. If we are unsuccessful at obtaining and enforcing patents, our competitors could use our technology and create products that compete with our products, without paying license fees or royalties to us.\n\u25cf\nThe preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications can be costly and time consuming. Our limited financial resources may not permit us to pursue patent protection of all of our technology and products in all key markets.\n\u25cf\nEven if we are able to obtain issued patents covering our technology or products, we may have to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses to enforce our patent rights to protect our technology and products from infringing uses. We may not have the financial resources to finance the litigation required to preserve our patent and trade secret rights.\n\u25cf\nLitigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be lost if the outcome of a proceeding is unfavorable to us.\nThere is no certainty that our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products and processes in the U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products and processes, or that the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. If we cannot prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect. Furthermore, we can provide no assurance that our products will not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties.\nIn Europe, there is uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for patent protection. The European Patent Convention prohibits the granting of European patents for inventions that concern \u201cuses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.\u201d A recent decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreted parthenogenetically produced hES cells as patentable subject matter. Consequently, the European Patent Office now recognizes that human pluripotent stem cells (including human ES cells) can be created without a destructive use of human embryos as of June 5, 2003, and patent applications relating to hES cell subject matter with a filing and priority date after this date are no longer automatically excluded from patentability under Article 53 (a) EPC and Rule 28(c) EPC.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends\nOur business depends on several critical technologies that are based in part on technology licensed from third parties. Those third-party license agreements impose obligations on us, including payment obligations and obligations to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents or technology. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation, our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products, and our ability to raise any capital that we might then need, could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, we would not be able to continue to use the licensed technology in our business.\nThe price and sale of our products and diagnostic tests may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation\nSuccess in selling our pharmaceutical and cell-based products, medical devices, and diagnostic tests may depend in part on the extent to which health insurance companies, HMOs, and government health administration authorities such as Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the cost of the products, tests, and related treatment. Until we introduce a new product or diagnostic test into the medical marketplace, we will not know with certainty whether adequate health insurance, HMO, and government coverage will be available to permit the product or test to be sold at a price high enough for us to generate a profit. In some foreign countries, pricing or profitability of health care products is subject to government control, which may result in low prices for our products. In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls, and new proposals are likely to be made in the future.\nThe ACA and future changes to that law may adversely affect our business\nAs a result of the adoption of the ACA, in the United States, substantial changes have been made to the system for paying for healthcare in the United States. The changes contemplated by the ACA are subject to rule-making and implementation timelines that extend for several years, as well as initiatives in Congress to amend or repeal the law, and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future. Certain provisions related to cost-savings and reimbursement measures could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business\nOur activities, and the activities of the BioTime Family of Companies, our collaborators, distributors and other third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. Our interactions in the U.S. or abroad with physicians and other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products are also subject to government regulation designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the sale and use of the products and place greater restrictions on the marketing practices of health care companies. Health care companies such as ours are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers from anti-corruption enforcement officials. In addition, health care companies such as ours have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations may be heightened as we continue to operate globally.\nRegulations governing the health care industry are subject to change, with possibly retroactive effect, including:\n\u00b7\nnew laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with wage and hour laws and other employment practices, method of delivery, payment for health care products and services, compliance with health information and data privacy and security laws and regulations, tracking and reporting payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions, product serialization and labeling requirements and used product take-back requirements;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;\n\u00b7\nrequirements that provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and quality data, such as the EMA\u2019s clinical transparency policy, which could impact our ability to protect trade secrets and competitively-sensitive information contained in approval applications or could be misinterpreted leading to reputational damage, misperception or legal action which could harm our business; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products.\nViolations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions against us, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third-party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nAsterias could lose its CIRM grant if Asterias fails to meet the clinical trial milestones that are a condition to CIRM\u2019s obligation to provide funding\nAsterias depends on its grant from CIRM as a source of financing for the costs of conducting its Phase I/IIa clinical trial and process development of AST-OPC1. Under the terms of the CIRM grant, Asterias must meet certain efficacy and progress milestones pertaining to the clinical trial. If Asterias fails to meet any of the milestones within the specified time frame, CIRM may discontinue providing grant funds to Asterias, which could force Asterias to postpone, delay, or discontinue the clinical trial and development work for the product.\nWe may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our product candidates and to provide the regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business\nWe may enter into various kinds of collaborative research and development and product marketing agreements to develop and commercialize our products. The expected future milestone payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our products, but there are risks associated with entering into collaboration arrangements.\nThere is a risk that we could become dependent upon one or more collaborative arrangements. A collaborative arrangement upon which we might depend might be terminated by our collaboration partner or a partner might determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of our products. A collaboration partner also may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing products and drug delivery approaches or technologies.\nThere is a risk that a collaboration partner might fail to perform its obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing its obligations. In addition, a collaboration partner may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent it from having available funds to contribute to the collaboration. If a collaboration partner fails to conduct its product development, commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if it terminates or materially modifies its agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such development and commercialization on our own.\nWe may need to rely on marketing partners or contract sales companies\nEven if we are able to develop our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals, we may choose to partner on one or more products for marketing, selling or distributing our products. If we do not partner for commercial services, we and our subsidiaries will be dependent on our ability to build our own marketing and distribution capability for our new products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we will need to find collaborative marketing partners or sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of our products.\nIf we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. As a result, our gross profit from product sales may be lower than it would be if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force. There can be no assurance we will able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates\nWe will need to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, data management companies, contract clinical research associates, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct any clinical trials that we may undertake for our products. We may also rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of product candidates. If we outsource clinical trials we may be unable to directly control the timing, conduct and expense of our clinical trials. If we enlist third parties to conduct clinical trials and they fail to successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to OncoCyte\u2019s Business Operations\nOncoCyte has determined that the initial diagnostic tests that it plans to develop and commercialize will be LDTs that will be performed at a diagnostic laboratory that OncoCyte plans to operate. The decision to develop and commercialize LDTs will give rise to certain risks related to the operation of the business of operating a diagnostic laboratory and performing LDTs, including the following risks.\nOncoCyte will need to obtain regulatory approval of its diagnostic laboratory facilities\nOncoCyte will need to receive certification for its planned diagnostic laboratory under the CLIA. In addition to meeting federal regulatory requirements, each state has its own laboratory certification and inspection requirements for a CLIA laboratory that must be met in order to sell diagnostic tests in the state. CLIA licensed laboratories can lose their licenses if problems arise during periodic regulatory inspections.\nThe FDA may impose additional regulations for laboratory developed tests such as the ones OncoCyte is developing\nThe FDA issued two draft guidance documents and a discussion paper that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs such as those OncoCyte is developing. If the FDA implements the new regulatory measures set forth in these documents:\n\u00b7\nOncoCyte may be required to obtain pre-market clearance or approval before selling its diagnostic tests;\n\u00b7\nAs a result of required FDA pre-market review, OncoCyte\u2019s tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u00b7\nFDA labeling requirements may limit OncoCyte\u2019s claims about its diagnostic tests, which may have a negative effect on orders from physicians;\n\u00b7\nThe regulatory approval process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and making a 510(k) submission, or filing a pre-market approval application with the FDA; and,\n\u00b7\nIf regulatory actions affect any of the reagents OncoCyte obtain from suppliers and use in conducting its tests, its business could be adversely affected in the form of increased costs of testing or delays, limits or prohibitions on the purchase of reagents necessary to perform its testing.\nOncoCyte will depend on Medicare and a limited number of private payers for a significant portion of its revenues, and its revenues could decline if these payers fail to provide timely and adequate payment for its diagnostic tests\nOncoCyte expects that a substantial portion of the patients for whom it will perform diagnostic tests will have Medicare as their primary medical insurance. Even if OncoCyte\u2019s planned tests are otherwise successful, reimbursement for the Medicare-covered portions of its planned tests might not, without Medicare reimbursement, produce sufficient revenues to enable it to reach profitability and achieve its other commercial objectives. It generally takes two to three years to obtain Medicare coverage and other third party reimbursement approvals for a new LDT and there can be no assurance OncoCyte will obtain such approvals for any of the cancer diagnostics that it is developing. Until a new cancer diagnostic test is accepted by third party payers for reimbursement, OncoCyte will have to market the test to physicians on a patient pay basis. In the absence of reimbursement by Medicare, patients who would be candidates for the use of OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests and who rely on Medicare coverage may decline to use those tests, and physicians may be reluctant to prescribe the tests, due to the cost of the test to the patients. Because of this patient cost factor, revenues from any new cancer test that OncoCyte markets will experience slow growth until the test is approved for reimbursement in an amount commensurate with the cost to the patient.\nMedicare and other third-party payers may change their coverage policies or cancel future contracts with OncoCyte at any time; review and adjust the rate of reimbursement; or stop paying for OncoCyte\u2019s tests altogether, which would reduce OncoCyte\u2019s total revenues. Payers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization, and delivery of health care services, and have undertaken measures to reduce payment rates for and decrease utilization of clinical laboratory testing. Because of the cost-trimming trends, any third-party payers that will cover and provide reimbursement for diagnostic tests may suspend, revoke or discontinue coverage at any time, or may reduce the reimbursement rates payable to OncoCyte. Any such action could have a negative impact on OncoCyte\u2019s revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in healthcare laws and policies may have a material adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nThe ACA substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA\u2019s key changes, the ACA reduced payment rates under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and established an Independent Payment Advisory Board to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if spending exceeds a target growth rate. Such provisions may negatively impact payment rates for OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests. The new U.S. presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority. On March 6, 2017, the American Health Care Act (\u201cAHCA\u201d) was introduced as the new administration\u2019s proposed replacement of ACA. The timing and method of repeal of ACA and adoption of the AHCA remains uncertain, but impending changes will likely impact the number of patient lives covered, the quality of the insurance, Medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protections provide.\nThe Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d) significantly altered the payment methodology under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule that determines Medicare coverage for laboratory tests. Under PAMA, clinical laboratories are required to report test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test and beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period.\nCongress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance payment requirement on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, which would require OncoCyte to bill patients for these amounts. In the event that Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for OncoCyte\u2019s tests could often exceed the amount actually received from the patient.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, Medicare payment for any new advanced diagnostic test will be based on the list price or charge. After the test is commercially available for three quarters, the laboratory will be required to report payment and volume information and that data will be used to set payment for the test for the following year.\n\u00b7\nIf data shows that the list price was greater than 130% of the payment using established methodology (a weighted median), CMS will recoup the difference from the laboratory through a payment claw back.\n\u00b7\nPayment will be updated annually based on the weighted median of commercial payer reimbursement.\nWe cannot predict whether future health care initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect OncoCyte. The expansion of government\u2019s role in the U.S. health care industry as a result of the ACA, and changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by Medicare and other payers for diagnostic tests may have a materially adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause of certain Medicare billing policies, OncoCyte may not receive complete reimbursement for tests provided to Medicare patients\nMedicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test or assay is approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither the supplier nor any other party, such as a diagnostic laboratory, may receive reimbursement from Medicare for the service. Regional policies are directed by Medicare\u2019s regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d). Reimbursement for diagnostic testing may be negatively impacted by California MAC policies.\nLong payment cycles of Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors, or other payment delays, could hurt OncoCyte\u2019s cash flows and increase its need for working capital\nMedicare and Medicaid have complex billing and documentation requirements that OncoCyte will have to satisfy in order to receive payment. Failure to comply with these requirements and other laws applicable to billing may result in, among other things, non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s revenues and earnings. Similarly, the failure of private health insurers or other private third-party payers to properly process OncoCyte\u2019s payment claims in a timely manner could delay its receipt of payment for its diagnostic tests and services, which may have a material adverse effect on its cash flows.\nPrivate health insurance company policies may deny coverage or limit the amount they will reimburse OncoCyte for the performance of its diagnostic tests\nPatients who are not covered by Medicare will generally rely on health insurance provided by private health insurance companies. If OncoCyte is considered a \u201cnon-contracted provider\u201d by a third-party payer, that payer may not reimburse patients for diagnostic tests performed by OncoCyte or doctors within the payer\u2019s network of covered physicians may not use its services to perform diagnostic tests for their patients. As a result, OncoCyte may need to enter into contracts with health insurance companies or other private payers to provide diagnostic tests to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement which may be lower than the rates OncoCyte might otherwise collect.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Common Shares\nOwnership of our common shares will entail certain risks associated with the volatility of prices for our common shares and the fact that we do not pay dividends on our common shares.\nOur net income or loss will be impacted by changes in the market value of Asterias and OncoCyte common stock\nBecause we use the equity method of accounting for the common stock of Asterias and OncoCyte that we hold at fair value, we will recognize gain or loss to the extent that the market value of Asterias and OncoCyte common stock changes from calendar quarter to calendar quarter, regardless of whether we sell any of those shares.\nBecause we are engaged in the development of pharmaceutical and stem cell therapy products and cancer diagnostic tests, the price of our common shares may rise and fall rapidly\n\u25cf\nThe market price of our common shares, like that of the shares of many biotechnology companies, has been highly volatile.\n\u25cf\nThe price of our common shares may rise rapidly in response to certain events, such as the commencement of clinical trials of an experimental new therapy or diagnostic test, even though the outcome of those trials and the likelihood of ultimate FDA approval of a therapeutic product remain uncertain.\n\u25cf\nSimilarly, prices of our common shares may fall rapidly in response to certain events such as unfavorable results of clinical trials or a delay or failure to obtain FDA approval.\n\u25cf\nThe failure of our earnings to meet analysts\u2019 expectations could result in a significant rapid decline in the market price of our common shares.\nCurrent economic and stock market conditions may adversely affect the price of our common shares\nThe stock market has been experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the equity securities without regard to the operating performance of the issuing companies. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nBecause we do not pay dividends, our common shares may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn dividend income\nWe do not pay cash dividends on our common shares. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that any earnings generated in our business will be used to finance the growth of our business and will not be paid out as dividends to holders of our common shares. This means that our common shares may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn income from their investments.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common shares and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common shares\nThe trading market for our common shares will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and our common shares. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common shares. If securities analysts do not cover our common shares, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of those shares. If securities analysts do cover our common shares, they could issue reports or recommendations that are unfavorable to the price of our common shares, and they could downgrade a previously favorable report or recommendation, and in either case our share prices could decline as a result of the report. If one or more of these analysts does not initiate coverage, ceases to cover our common shares or fails to publish regular reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share prices or trading volume to decline.\nInvestors in our common shares may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional common shares and preferred shares by us and our subsidiaries\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 152,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 150,000,000 common shares and 2,000,000 \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares. As of December 31, 2016, there were 103,396,245 common shares outstanding of which 619,706 were held by our subsidiaries, 6,958,458 common shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans; 100,000 common shares reserved for issuance upon the lapse of RSUs under our employee stock option plan; and 9,394,862 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of common share purchase warrants, including the publicly traded warrants.\nThe operation of some of our subsidiaries has been financed in part through the sale of capital stock in those subsidiaries to private investors. Sales of additional subsidiary shares could reduce our ownership interest in the subsidiaries, and correspondingly dilute our shareholder\u2019s ownership interests in our consolidated enterprise. Our subsidiaries also have their own stock option plans and the exercise of subsidiary stock options or the sale of restricted stock under those plans would also reduce our ownership interest in the subsidiaries, with a resulting dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our shareholders in our consolidated enterprise.\nWe and our subsidiaries may issue additional common shares or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common shares in order to raise additional capital, or in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, or in connection with future acquisitions of licenses to technology or rights to acquire products, or in connection with future business acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional common shares or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares.\nWe may also issue preferred shares having rights, preferences, and privileges senior to the rights of our common shares with respect to dividends, rights to share in distributions of our assets if we liquidate our company, or voting rights. Any preferred shares may also be convertible into common shares on terms that would be dilutive to holders of common shares. Our subsidiaries may also issue their own preferred shares with a similar dilutive impact on our ownership of the subsidiaries.\nThe market price of our common shares could be impacted by prices at which we sell shares in our subsidiaries\nThe operation of some our subsidiaries has been financed in part through the sale of capital stock in those subsidiaries, and our subsidiaries may sell shares of their capital stock in the future for financing purposes. The prices at which our subsidiaries may sell shares of their capital stock could impact the value of our company as a whole and could impact the price at which our common shares trade in the market. A sale of capital stock of one of our subsidiaries at a price that the market perceives as low could adversely impact the market price of our common shares. Even if our subsidiaries sell their capital stock at prices that reflect arm\u2019s length negotiation with investors, there is no assurance that those prices will reflect a true fair market value or that the ascribed value of the subsidiaries based on those share prices will be fully reflected in the market value of our common shares.\nThe implementation of a new FASB accounting standard could increase the risk that our future consolidated financial statements could be qualified by going concern uncertainty\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU No. 2014-15 defines management\u2019s responsibility to assess an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for us for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter. In connection with preparing consolidated financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, ASU No. 2014-15 requires that an entity\u2019s management evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). As a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2014-15, we will be required to have more cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investments on hand on the date we issue or file our consolidated financial statements than had been the case during prior years in order to avoid a going concern qualification in our auditor\u2019s report and in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. If our consolidated financial statements were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty or if we are unable to alleviate substantial doubt as part of our going concern assessment, or both, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nAsterias and OncoCyte will also be impacted by ASU No. 2014-15 in much the same manner as us. If the financial statements of Asterias, or OncoCyte, or both, were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty, the market price of their common stock could decline, resulting in a loss or decline in value of the Asterias shares we own, the OncoCyte shares we own, or both, as equity method investments at fair value.", "PERMNO": 77393, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "LCTX"}
