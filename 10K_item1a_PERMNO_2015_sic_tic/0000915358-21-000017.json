RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry or financial position or our future financial performance. While the Company believes it has identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting its business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect its business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have adversely affected the Company\u2019s results of operations and its financial condition, and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, especially beginning in mid-March, and such impact continued in fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and both public and private measures taken to contain it have negatively affected the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, all of which may continue or worsen.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations have been and may be further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in several ways, including, the following:\n- interruptions, availability or delays in global shipping to transport our products\n- further slowdown or stoppage in the supply chain\n- further disruptions to our operations, including additional facility closures and restrictions\non our operations\n- limitations on employee resources and availability, including sickness and government\nrestrictions\n- greater difficulty in generating sales or collecting customer receivables\n- an increase in the cost of or obtaining debt or equity financing or the Company\u2019s ability to fund\noperations or investment opportunities\n- changes to the carrying value of our intangible assets and\n- an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility that could negatively impact\nthe Company\u2019s stock price\nThe Company has and will continue to take actions to manage its expenses and to conserve its financial resources. The Company\u2019s future strategies, prospects, and plans for growth may also be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak within the U.S., China, Mexico, Vietnam and Taiwan, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, the Company may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to its business as a result of the pandemic\u2019s global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19, or a similar health epidemic or pandemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company does not yet know the full extent of the impacts on its business, its operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. While it continues to monitor the business metrics that it has historically used to predict its financial performance, it is uncertain as to whether these metrics will continue to function as they have in the past.\nThe availability of raw components or an increase in their price may affect the Company\u2019s operations and profits.\nThe Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company\u2019s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer\u2019s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater buying power from suppliers. The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers, but the Company frequently places cancellable scheduled purchase orders with suppliers that extend out as far as one year. The current component market place remains volatile. The Company\u2019s orders for components are always based on the changing needs of its customers. Many components are on allocation. Currently there is not enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand for raw components. In some cases shipment to the Company\u2019s customers have been delayed. Component shortages are expected to continue during fiscal year 2022.\nWagz\u2019s repayment of the Convertible Debt and Secured Promissory Note issued to the Company is not certain.\nAs of April 30, 2021, Wagz is indebted to SigmaTron under the terms of a Convertible Secured Promissory Note in the maximum principal amount of $4,052,478 dated May 29, 2020; a Convertible Secured Promissory Note, in the maximum principal amount of $1,588,328 dated January 27, 2021; and a Convertible Secured Promissory Note in the maximum principal amount of $1,249,966 (together with any additional convertible debt issued by Wagz to the Company, the \u201cConvertible Debt\u201d); and a Secured Promissory Note in the maximum principal amount of $308,329 dated April 30, 2021. It is anticipated that the Company will convert the Convertible Debt into Wagz common stock in the Company\u2019s anticipated acquisition of Wagz. However, the consummation of the acquisition is subject to numerous conditions (see Item 1. CAUTIONARY NOTE; Recent Developments), which, if not satisfied, could prevent the acquisition. The Notes are due on the earliest to occur of (a) December 31, 2021 or, if the Closing does not occur due to the Company\u2019s termination of the Agreement, that date which is twelve (12) months after the date of such SigmaTron Termination, (b) upon the closing of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets or common stock of Wagz (other than the Closing), or (c) an Event of Default. If Wagz is unable to pay the Convertible Debt or Secured Promissory Note, and the Company forecloses its security interest in the Wagz collateral, there is no assurance that the Company will recover sufficient value from the Wagz collateral to pay the Convertible Debt in full. On July 19, 2021 the definitive agreement was signed.\nThe Company may not be able to provide the working capital that Wagz will need to fund operations until its cashflow is sufficient.\nThe Company is Wagz\u2019s primary source of working capital to finance its operations. As of April 30, 2021, Wagz is already indebted to the Company a total of $6,890,772 in Convertible Debt and $308,329 in a Secured Promissory Note and it is expected that Wagz will need additional working capital before its cashflow will sustain its operations. It is not certain how much more working capital that Wagz will need. It is also not certain that the Company will be able to provide all of the working capital that Wagz will need. Among other conditions, the Company\u2019s primary secured lender has limited the Company\u2019s advances to Wagz to $5,000,000 made after January 29, 2021, of which $1,475,000 has been made from February 1, 2021 through April 30, 2021. As of May 1, 2021 through July 20, 2021 an additional $1,537,000 was advanced to Wagz. If Wagz does not have sufficient working capital, it may not be able to bring its products to market and may be forced to liquidate, without paying the Convertible Debt or the Secured Promissory Note in full. If Wagz is unable to pay the Convertible Debt and the Secured Promissory Note in full, and the Company forecloses its security interest in the Wagz collateral, there is no assurance that the Company will recover sufficient value from the Wagz collateral to pay the Convertible Debt and the Secured Promissory Note in full.\nThe Company experiences variable operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, including on a quarterly basis. Consequently, results of operations in any period should not be\nconsidered indicative of the results for any future period, and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Some of these factors include:\n- changes in sales mix to customers\n- changes in availability and rising component costs\n- volume of customer orders relative to capacity\n- market demand and acceptance of our customers\u2019 products\n- price erosion within the EMS marketplace\n- capital equipment requirements needed to remain technologically competitive\n- volatility in the U.S. and international economic and financial markets\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is volatile.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock historically has experienced significant volatility due to fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings, other factors relating to the Company\u2019s operations, the market\u2019s changing expectations for the Company\u2019s growth, overall equity market conditions and other factors unrelated to the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, the limited float of the Company\u2019s common stock and the limited number of market makers also affect the volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. Such fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.\nOur customers have competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, pricing pressure and decreasing demand from their customers, which could adversely affect their business and the Company\u2019s business.\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our customers\u2019 products could negatively impact our customers and the Company. These factors include:\n- increased competition among our customers and their competitors\n- the inability of our customers to develop and market their products\n- recessionary periods in our customers\u2019 markets\n- the potential that our customers\u2019 products become obsolete\n- our customers\u2019 inability to react to rapidly changing technology\nAny such factor or a combination of factors could negatively impact our customers\u2019 need for or ability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf any of the Company\u2019s customers have financial difficulties, the Company could encounter delays or defaults in the payment of amounts owed for accounts receivable and inventory obligations. This could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is concentrated.\nSales to the Company\u2019s five largest customers accounted for 57.8% and 51.4% of net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, and April 30, 2020, respectively. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, two customers accounted for 17.9% and 16.2% of net sales of the Company, and 3.8% and 5.6%, respectively, of accounts receivable. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, two customers accounted for 16.7% and 14.1% of net sales of the Company, and 3.6% and 5.0%, respectively, of accounts receivable. Significant reductions in sales to any of the Company\u2019s major customers or the loss of a major customer could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company cannot replace cancelled or reduced orders, sales will decline, which could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will retain any or all of its largest customers. This risk may be further complicated by pricing pressures and intense competition prevalent in our industry.\nThe Company faces intense industry competition and downward pricing pressures.\nThe EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater experience, as well as greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than the Company. Competition from existing or potential new competitors may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The introduction of lower priced competitive products, significant price reductions by the Company\u2019s competitors or significant pricing pressures from its customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to its continued operations.\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cLender\u201d), pursuant to which Lender has agreed to provide the Company with a secured credit facility maturing on January 29,2026, of which (a) up to $50,000,000 is available on a revolving loan basis, and (b) an aggregate of $6,500,000 was borrowed pursuant to two term loans (the \u201cFacility\u201d). The Facility is secured by substantially all of SigmaTron\u2019 assets including mortgages on its two Illinois properties.\nThe Facility allows the Company to choose among interest rates at which it may borrow funds for revolving loans: \u201cCBFR Loans,\u201d the interest on which is based on (A) the \u201cREVLIBOR30 Rate\u201d (as defined in the Agreement) unless the REVLIBOR30 Rate is not available, in which case the interest is generally the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the \u201cPrime Rate\u201d in the U.S., plus (B) an applicable margin of 2.0% (effectively 2.25% per annum at April 30, 2021); or \u201cEurodollar Loans,\u201d the interest on which is based on (X) an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Agreement) for any interest period multiplied by the Standard Reserve Rate (as defined in the Agreement) plus (Y) an applicable margin of 2.0%. Under the revolving portion of the Facility, the Company may borrow up to the lesser of (i) $50,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the inventory borrowing base. The Facility is collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company. Under the Agreement, a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (\u201cFCCR\u201d) financial covenant of 1.10x is applicable only during an FCCR trigger period which occurs when (i) an event of default (as defined in the Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, and Lender has elected to impose a FCCR trigger period upon notice to the Company or (ii) availability falls below the greater of (a) 10% of the revolving commitment and (b) the outstanding principal amount of the term loans.\nOn April 23, 2020, the Company received a PPP Loan from U.S. Bank, as lender, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, as administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) in the amount of $6,282,973 (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d). The PPP Loan matures on April 23, 2022. The Company was notified of the forgiveness of the PPP Loan by the SBA on July 9, 2021 and it covers all principal and accrued interest. The accounting for the forgiveness will be reflected in the Company\u2019s first quarter financial statements for fiscal year 2022.\nOn March 15, 2019, the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank. On January 26, 2021, the agreement was amended. Under the agreement SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. can borrow up to 9,000,000 Renminbi, approximately $1,380,000 as of April 30, 2021, and the facility is collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.\u2019s manufacturing building. Interest is payable monthly and the facility bears a fixed interest rate of 3.85% per annum. The term of the facility extends to January 6, 2022. There was $824,159 outstanding under the facility at April 30, 2021 compared to an outstanding balance of $304,658 at April 30, 2020.\nThe Company may not be entitled to forgiveness of its recently received Paycheck Protection Program Loan (\u201cPPP Loan\u201d), and its application for the PPP Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible.\nOn April 23, 2020 the Company received proceeds of $6,282,973 from a loan under the PPP of the CARES Act, which it has used to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan matures on April 23, 2022 if not forgiven and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Due to the size of the PPP Loan, it is subject to review by the lender and the SBA, which introduces an additional layer of uncertainty.\nUnder the CARES Act, small businesses may apply for a PPP Loan if they employ no more than 500 employees, or are a business in an industry that has an employee-based size standard established by the SBA that is greater than 500 employees. The Company operates under NAICS Code 334418 where the maximum employee headcount for a small business is 750. In establishing eligibility for a PPP Loan, the Company has considered its U.S. resident headcount based on the SBA rules in place at the time of its application, which the Company believes places the Company within the eligibility parameters.\nUnder the CARES Act, forgiveness of a PPP Loan is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the 24-week period beginning on the date of loan approval. The Company may be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal of its PPP Loan that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and it cannot provide any assurance that it will be eligible for loan forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. If the PPP Loan is not forgiven, the Company will be required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize by April 23, 2022 any principal amount outstanding on the PPP Loan. The Company was notified of the forgiveness of the PPP Loan by the SBA on July 9, 2021 and it covers all principal and accrued interest. The accounting for the forgiveness will be reflected in the Company\u2019s first quarter financial statements for fiscal year 2022.\nEven though the PPP Loan has been forgiven, it remains subject to audit by the SBA. In order to apply for the PPP Loan, the Company was required to certify, that the current economic uncertainty, including, among other factors, the short term customer demand reduction, made the PPP Loan request necessary to support its ongoing operations. The Company made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, the continued employment of its entire U.S. workforce, certain obvious \u201cwork-from-home\u201d limitations associated with the nature of its business, and its ability to meet fixed cost obligations, in light of customer concerns. Furthermore, the Company considered its classification as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules and its need for additional funding to continue operations, and its lack of ability to currently access alternative forms of capital in the current market environment to fund working capital requirements. Based on this analysis, the Company believes that it satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that the receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the CARES Act. If, despite the Company\u2019s actions and certification that it satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, it is later determined that it violated applicable laws or was otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, it may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties and interest, which could also result in adverse publicity and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. If these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse market conditions could reduce our future sales and earnings per share.\nUncertainty over the erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns about volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, declining asset values, inflation, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations has slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in many countries, including in the United States, Europe and certain countries in Asia over the past several years. The economic recovery of recent years is fragile and recessionary conditions have returned. Any of these potential negative economic conditions may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products and adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales. Consequently, the Company\u2019s past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of the Company\u2019s future operating results, earnings and cash flows.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum and other raw materials utilized by the Company. Changes in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more of the U.S.\u2019 trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for the Company to import our products from those countries. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in a lower margin on products sold.\nChina and the European Union have imposed tariffs on U.S. products in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs. Additional tariffs could be imposed by China and the European Union in response to proposed increased tariffs on products imported from China and the European Union. There is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by other countries. The resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of steel, aluminum and other raw materials utilized by the Company imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the proposed business combination between SigmaTron and Wagz (the \u201cWagz acquisition\u201d), including anticipated revenue and cost synergies; costs associated with achieving synergies or integrating Wagz may exceed its expectations; and there is no assurance that the acquisition will close.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the Wagz acquisition, including anticipated revenue and cost synergies. There can be no assurance that the Wagz acquisition will be beneficial to the Company. Moreover, the Company may not be able to integrate the assets acquired in the Wagz acquisition or achieve our expected cost synergies without increases in costs or as a result of other difficulties. Although Wagz will be a stand-alone operation of SigmaTron, the integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve operational synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the Wagz acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses. Any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with the integration of Wagz could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the market price of its common stock.\nThe overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. In addition, even if the operations of the Company\u2019s business and Wagz\u2019s business are integrated successfully, the Company may not realize the full benefits of the Wagz acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that it expects. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nThere is no assurance that the acquisition of Wagz will be consummated, and in addition to related risks disclosed above relating to Wagz\u2019s repayment of certain Convertible Debt and Secured Promissory Note, failure to close the transaction may create other expenses and other detrimental business consequences to the Company.\nAn adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company pays interest on outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate. An adverse change in the Company\u2019s interest rates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely affect interest rates which may have an adverse impact on the Company.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in financial and other derivatives contracts that are currently indexed to United States dollar LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to financial and other derivative contracts exposed to LIBOR. Uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR. The interest rate for the Company\u2019s secured credit facility is calculated using LIBOR. At this time, due to a lack of consensus existing as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the Company\u2019s liquidity. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist or a new method of calculating LIBOR is adopted, the Company\u2019s lender may, on notice to the Company, select an interest rate to replace LIBOR in accordance with the Agreement, and there is a risk that the replacement rate will be less favorable to the Company than the rates based on LIBOR. In addition, these changes may have an adverse impact on the value of or interest earned on any LIBOR-based marketable securities, loans and derivatives that are included in the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the security of the Company\u2019s Information Technology systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, the Company\u2019s reputation may be severely harmed and it may be exposed to liability.\nThe Company\u2019s system stores confidential information which includes its financial information, its customers\u2019 proprietary email distribution lists, product information, supplier information, and other critical data. Any accidental or willful security breach or other unauthorized access could expose the Company to liability for the loss of such information, adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity, which could severely damage the Company\u2019s reputation. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee action or error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in its software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of the Company\u2019s customer data, its relationships with its customers may be severely damaged, and the Company could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company and its third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify customers of data security breaches involving their data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause the Company\u2019s customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of its data security measures. Any security breach whether actual or perceived, could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, could cause it to lose customers and may negatively impact its ability to acquire new customers.\nWith the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct business, a company is susceptible to operational, information security and related risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyberattacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through \u201chacking\u201d or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption (e.g., ransomware attacks). Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended\nusers). Cyber incidents affecting the Company or its service providers have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, interference with the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business in the ordinary course, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, additional compliance costs and, in extreme cases, have caused companies to cease doing business. Cyber events also can affect counterparties or entities with which the Company does business, governmental and other regulatory authorities, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, among others. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the Company has established risk management systems to prevent such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such systems including the possibility that the Company has not prepared for certain risks that have not been or are not possible to have been identified. Further, the Company may be able to influence, but cannot control, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by its service providers or any other third parties whose operations may affect the Company. The Company could be negatively impacted as a result.\nMost of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 production schedules are volatile, which makes it difficult to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities and manage inventory levels.\nThe volume and timing of sales to the Company\u2019s customers may vary due to:\n- component availability\n- customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory\n- variation in demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products\n- design changes, or\n- acquisitions of or consolidation among customers\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers production schedules are volatile. The Company\u2019s inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels. The Company could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of its customers. Orders from the Company\u2019s customers could be cancelled or delivery schedules could be deferred as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 demand, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations in any given period.\nAdverse changes in the economy or political conditions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for its customers\u2019 products. The uncertainty in the U.S. and international economic and political environments could result in a decline in demand for our customers\u2019 products in any industry. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws or trade policies affecting our customers could result in decreasing gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company and its customers may be unable to keep current with the industry\u2019s technological changes.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing product development. The future success of the Company\u2019s business will depend in large part upon our customers\u2019 ability to maintain and enhance their technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nThere is a risk of fluctuation of various currencies integral to the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company purchases some of its material components and funds some of its operations in foreign currencies. From time to time the currencies fluctuate against the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and performance. The impact of currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of $285,389\ncompared to net foreign currency losses of approximately $286,000 in the prior year. These fluctuations are expected to continue and could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company did not, and is not expected to, utilize derivatives or hedge foreign currencies to reduce the risk of such fluctuations.\nThe Company has foreign operations that may pose additional risks.\nThe Company has substantial manufacturing operations in multiple countries. Therefore, the Company\u2019s foreign businesses and results of operations are dependent upon numerous related factors, including the stability of the foreign economies, the political climate, relations with the United States, prevailing worker wages, the legal authority of the Company to operate and expand its business in a foreign country, the ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified personnel and operating management in Mexico, China and Vietnam, and the Company\u2019s ability to manage disruptions resulting from foreign government lockdowns and other actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company obtains many of its materials and components through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company\u2019s access to these materials and components is dependent on the continued viability of its Asian suppliers.\nApproximately 39% of the total assets of the Company are located in foreign jurisdictions outside the United States as of April 30, 2021, 21% and 15% of the total assets were located in Mexico and China, respectively, and 3% in other foreign locations. As of April 30, 2020, approximately 37% of the total assets were located in foreign jurisdictions, 17% were located in each of China and Mexico, and 3% in other foreign locations.\nThe Company depends on management and skilled personnel.\nThe Company depends significantly on its President/CEO/Chairman of the Board and other executive officers. The Company\u2019s employees generally are not bound by employment agreements and the Company cannot assure that it will retain its executive officers or skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, despite significant competition, continued growth and expansion of the Company\u2019s EMS business will require that the Company attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel. The Company\u2019s future growth depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and skilled, experienced employees. The Company\u2019s future growth also depends on its ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees. A failure to obtain or retain the number of skilled employees necessary to support the Company\u2019s efforts, a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of skilled, experienced employees could jeopardize its ability to meet its growth targets.\nFavorable labor relations are important to the Company.\nThe Company currently has labor union contracts with its employees constituting approximately 49% and 46% of its workforce for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although the Company believes its labor relations are good, any labor disruptions, whether union-related or otherwise, could significantly impair the Company\u2019s business, substantially increase the Company\u2019s costs or otherwise have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations could subject the Company to liability.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process. To date, the cost to the Company of such compliance has not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, the Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by the\nCompany and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by the Company to comply with present or future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production which could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nConflict minerals regulations may cause the Company to incur additional expenses and could increase the cost of components contained in its products and adversely affect its inventory supply chain.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) thereunder, require the Company to determine and report annually whether any conflict minerals contained in our products originated from the DRC or an adjoining country. The Dodd-Frank Act and these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain conflict minerals at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of conflict minerals, since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict-free conflict minerals. Our customers may require that our products contain only conflict-free conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement. Additionally, the Company may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders if our products are not conflict-free. The Company could incur significant costs in the event we are unable to manufacture products that contain only conflict-free conflict minerals or to the extent that we are required to make changes to products, processes, or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures.\nCustomer relationships with start-up companies present more risk.\nA small portion of the Company\u2019s current customer base is comprised of start-up companies. Customer relationships with start-up companies may present heightened risk due to the lack of product history. Slow market acceptance of their products could result in demand fluctuations causing inventory levels to rise. Further, the current economic environment could make it difficult for such emerging companies to obtain additional funding. This may result in additional credit risk including, but not limited to, the collection of trade account receivables and payment for their inventory. If the Company does not have adequate allowances recorded, the results of operations may be negatively affected.\nChanges in securities laws and regulations may increase costs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and listing requirements subsequently adopted by NASDAQ in response to Sarbanes-Oxley, have required changes in corporate governance practices, internal control policies and securities disclosure and compliance practices of public companies. More recently the Dodd-Frank Act requires changes to our corporate governance, compliance practices and securities disclosures. Compliance following the implementation of these rules has increased our legal, financial and accounting costs. The Company expects increased costs related to these new regulations to continue, including, but not limited to, legal, financial and accounting costs. These developments may result in the Company having difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified members of the board or qualified officers. Further, the costs associated with the compliance with and implementation of procedures under these laws and related rules could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nInadequate internal control over financial reporting could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock.\nIf the Company identifies and reports a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, stockholders and the Company\u2019s lenders could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements. This could have a material adverse impact on the value of the Company\u2019s stock and the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nDisclosure and internal controls may not detect all errors or fraud.\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance that the procedures will meet the control objectives. Controls are limited in their effectiveness by human error, including faulty judgments in decision-making. Further, controls can be circumvented by collusion of two or\nmore people or by management override of controls. Therefore, the Company\u2019s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot conclude with certainty that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.\nAny litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nIn the past, the Company has been notified of claims relating to various matters including contractual matters, product liability, labor issues or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of any such claim, the Company may be required to spend a significant amount of money and resources, even where the claim is without merit or covered by insurance. Accordingly, the resolution of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 80274, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "SGMA"}
