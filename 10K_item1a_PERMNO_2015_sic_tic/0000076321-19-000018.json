You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K, including Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. While these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider, they are not the only risks or uncertainties facing us or which may adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Chapter 11 Proceedings\nOn December 12, 2018, Parker Drilling and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions commencing the Chapter 11 Cases under the Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring may have a material adverse impact on the trading price and ultimately are expected to result in the cancellation and discharge of our securities, including our common stock. The Plan governs distributions to and the recoveries of holders of our securities.\nIn 2018, we engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic and refinancing alternatives to restructure our indebtedness in private transactions. These restructuring efforts led to the execution of the RSA and commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court on December 12, 2018.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our senior management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, our customers and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nOther significant risks include or relate to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases, including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession;\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate the Plan;\n\u2022\nthe effects of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and the interest of various constituents, including our stockholders;\n\u2022\nincreased advisory costs to execute our reorganization;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, customers, employees and other third parties as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nBankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of all other pending litigation and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022\nthe length of time that we will operate with Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings;\n\u2022\nthird-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with our ability to consummate the Plan; and\n\u2022\nthe potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our liquidity and results of operations.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nDelays in the Chapter 11 Cases may increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThe RSA contemplates the consummation of the Plan through an orderly prearranged plan of reorganization, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate the Plan. A prolonged Chapter 11 proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees, among other parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement the Plan (or any other plan of reorganization). If we are unable to consummate the Plan, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.\nIn addition, the occurrence of the Effective Date is subject to certain conditions and requirements in addition to those described above that may not be satisfied.\nWe believe it is likely that our common stock will substantially decrease in value as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our current common stock in our capital structure. Our existing common stock has substantially decreased in value during the Chapter 11 Cases. We do not foresee a market for our existing common stock after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, any trading in our common stock during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of our common stock.\nThe RSA is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nThere are certain material conditions we must satisfy under the RSA, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the Chapter 11 Cases, which include the consummation of the Plan. Our ability to timely complete such milestones is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe Plan may not become effective.\nWhile the Plan has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (some of which are beyond our control). There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied and, therefore, that the Plan will become effective and that the Debtors will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by the Plan. If the Effective Date is delayed, the Debtors may not have sufficient cash available to operate their businesses. In that case, the Debtors may need new or additional post-petition financing, which may increase the cost of consummating the Plan. There is no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Plan. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan or any other Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may continue to face a number of risks, such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our services and increasing expenses. Some of these risks become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, we cannot guarantee that any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through a plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our access to additional financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, even with the creditor support for the restructuring under the RSA, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, we cannot give any assurance of our ability to continue as a going concern, even though the Plan has been confirmed.\nOur shares of common stock are not listed for trading on a national securities exchange.\nOur common stock currently trades on OTC Pink and is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange. We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on OTC Pink, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on OTC Pink, whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for our common stock will continue on OTC Pink in the future.\nInvestments in securities trading on OTC Pink are generally less liquid than investments in securities trading on a national securities exchange. In addition, the trading of our common stock on OTC Pink could have other negative implications, including\nthe potential loss of confidence in us by suppliers, customers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our common stock. This could further depress the trading price of our common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any public market for our common stock will exist in the future or that we will be able to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in the Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, which may be volatile.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to our historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to the Plan. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting may be different from historical trends.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Court provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to consummation of a plan of reorganization. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to December 12, 2018 or before consummation of the Plan (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Plan and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Plan. Any claims not ultimately discharged pursuant to the Plan could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nWe may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience employee attrition, and our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe volatility of prices for oil and natural gas has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOil and natural gas prices and market expectations regarding potential changes in these prices are volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices and expectations of future prices could have an impact on our customers\u2019 long-term exploration and development activities, which in turn could materially affect our business and financial performance. Furthermore, higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result immediately in increased drilling activity because our customers\u2019 expectations of future oil and natural gas prices typically drive demand for our drilling services. The oil and natural gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A prolonged downturn in the oil and\nnatural gas industry could result in a further reduction in demand for oilfield services and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The average price of oil during 2018 was well below the average prices in 2014. Oil and natural gas prices and demand for our services also depend upon numerous factors which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding future energy prices;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development, and production technology;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and prices;\n\u2022\nthe level of production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nthe adoption or repeal of laws and government regulations, both in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nthe imposition or lifting of economic sanctions against certain regions, persons, and other entities;\n\u2022\nthe number of ongoing and recently completed rig construction projects which may create overcapacity;\n\u2022\nlocal and worldwide military, political, and economic events, including events in the oil producing regions of Africa, the Middle East, Russia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nexpansion or contraction of worldwide economic activity, which affects levels of consumer and industrial demand;\n\u2022\nthe rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policies;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nincreased demand for alternative energy sources and electric vehicles, including government initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources and the growing public sentiment around alternatives to oil and gas; and\n\u2022\nthe policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves.\nDemand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and natural gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and natural gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDemand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures for the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas reserves by the major, independent, and national oil and natural gas E&P companies and large integrated service companies that comprise our customer base. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines in oil and natural gas prices have and may continue to result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, any of which could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Historically, when drilling activity and spending decline, utilization and dayrates also decline and drilling may be reduced or discontinued, resulting in an oversupply of drilling rigs. Sustained low oil prices have in turn caused a significant decline in the demand for drilling services over the last several years. The rig utilization rate of our International & Alaska Drilling segment has risen to 37.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 36.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017. Furthermore, operators implemented significant reductions in capital spending in their budgets, including the cancellation or deferral of existing programs, and are expected to continue to operate under reduced budgets for the foreseeable future.\nWe have a significant amount of funded debt. Our debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may have significant consequences for our future prospects, including limiting our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had:\n\u2022\n$585.0 million principal amount of debt;\n\u2022\n$26.9 million of operating lease commitments; and\n\u2022\n$10.0 million borrowed under the DIP Facility.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur negative cash flows from one or more segments of our operating activities. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be influenced by the demand for our drilling services, the utilization of our rigs, the dayrates that we receive for our rigs, demand for our rental tools, oil and natural gas prices, general economic conditions, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may have to take one or more of the following actions:\n\u2022\ndelay spending on capital projects, including maintenance projects and the acquisition or construction of additional rigs, rental tools, and other assets;\n\u2022\nissue additional equity;\n\u2022\nsell assets; or\n\u2022\nrestructure or refinance our debt.\nAs of December 12, 2018, the Company was in default under certain of its debt instruments. The Company\u2019s filing of the Chapter 11 Cases described above accelerated the Company\u2019s obligations under its Senior Notes. All of the Company\u2019s outstanding obligations under its 2015 Secured Credit Agreement were paid prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was terminated substantially concurrently with such filing. Additionally, events of default under the indentures governing the Company\u2019s Senior Notes have occurred and are continuing, including as a result of cross-defaults between such indentures.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness, including limiting our liquidity and our ability to pursue other business opportunities.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to certain limitations, including under the DIP Facility, the First Lien Exit Facility and the Second Lien Exit Facility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase. Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nFurther, under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market or industry conditions. The Debtors are subject to various covenants and events of default under the DIP Facility. In general, certain of these covenants limit the Debtors\u2019 ability, subject to certain exceptions, to take certain actions, including:\n\u2022\nselling assets outside the ordinary course of business\u037e\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging, amalgamating, liquidating, dividing, winding up, dissolving or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of its assets\u037e\n\u2022\ngranting liens; and\n\u2022\nfinancing its investments.\nIf the Debtors fail to comply with these covenants or an event of default occurs under the DIP Facility, our liquidity, financial condition or operations may be materially impacted.\nOur current operations and future growth may require significant additional capital, and the amount and terms of our indebtedness could impair our ability to fund our capital requirements. The DIP Facility may be insufficient to fund our cash requirements through emergence from bankruptcy.\nOur business requires substantial capital. We may require additional capital in the event of growth opportunities, unanticipated maintenance requirements, or significant departures from our current business plan.\nAdditional financing may not be available on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in the DIP Facility. Failure to obtain additional financing, should the need for it develop, could impair our ability to fund capital expenditure requirements and meet debt service requirements and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, for the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, we will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund the plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and our reorganization.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the plan of reorganization are not completed and the effective date of the plan of reorganization does not occur prior to the maturity of the DIP Facility, we may need to refinance the DIP Facility. We may not be able to obtain some or all of any such financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may be unable to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, whether at maturity or as a result of acceleration.\nWe may not be able to repay our debt as it comes due, or to refinance our debt on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in the DIP Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes. Failure to repay or to timely refinance any portion of our debt could result in a default under the terms of all our debt instruments and permit the acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding.\nWhile we intend to take appropriate mitigating actions to refinance our indebtedness prior to maturity or otherwise extend the maturity dates, and to cure any potential defaults, there is no assurance that any particular actions with respect to refinancing existing indebtedness, extending the maturity of existing indebtedness or curing potential defaults in our existing and future debt agreements will be sufficient.\nOur backlog of contracted revenues may not be fully realized and may reduce significantly in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur expected revenues under existing contracts (\u201ccontracted revenues\u201d) may not be fully realized due to a number of factors, including rig or equipment downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause downtime or a suspension of operations, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nbreakdowns of our equipment or the equipment of others necessary for continuation of operations;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, including labor strikes;\n\u2022\nshortages of material and skilled labor;\n\u2022\nsevere weather or harsh operating conditions;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases or any government response to such occurrence or threat;\n\u2022\nthe early termination of contracts; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure events.\nLiquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate, cancel, or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons. Some of our contracts permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), generally exercisable upon advance notice to us and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us. There can be no assurance that our customers will be able or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us.\nSignificant declines in oil prices, the perceived risk of low oil prices for an extended period, and the resulting downward pressure on utilization may cause some customers to consider early termination of select contracts despite having to pay early termination fees in some cases. In addition, customers may request to re-negotiate the terms of existing contracts. Furthermore, as our existing contracts roll off, we may be unable to secure replacement contracts for our rigs, equipment or services. We have been in discussions with some of our customers regarding these issues. Therefore, revenues recorded in future periods could differ materially from our current contracted revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCertain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with little or no notice.\nIn periods of extended market weakness similar to the current environment, our customers may not be able to honor the terms of existing contracts, may terminate contracts even where there may be onerous termination fees, or may seek to renegotiate contract dayrates and terms in light of depressed market conditions. Certain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with relatively little or no notice. Significant declines in oil prices, the perceived risk of low oil prices for an extended period, and the resulting downward pressure on utilization may cause some customers to consider early termination of select contracts despite having to pay early termination fees in some cases. When drilling market conditions are depressed, a customer may no longer need a rig or rental tools currently under contract or may be able to obtain comparable equipment at lower dayrates. Further, due to government actions, a customer may no longer be able to operate in, or it may not be economical to operate in, certain regions. As a result, customers may leverage their termination rights in an effort to renegotiate contract terms.\nOur customers may also seek to terminate contracts for cause, such as the loss of or major damage to the drilling unit or other events that cause the suspension of drilling operations beyond a specified period of time. If we experience operational problems or if our equipment fails to function properly and cannot be repaired promptly, our customers will not be able to engage in drilling operations and may have the right to terminate the contracts. If equipment is not timely delivered to a customer or does not pass acceptance testing, a customer may in certain circumstances have the right to terminate the contract. The payment of a termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Early termination of a contract may result in a rig or other equipment being idle for an extended period of time. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness. The cancellation or renegotiation of a number of our contracts could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.\nService contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in service contracts with non-governmental customers.\nWe currently provide services and own rigs and other equipment that may be used in connection with projects involving national oil companies. In the future, we may expand our international operations and enter into additional, significant contracts or subcontracts relating to projects with national oil companies. The terms of these contracts may require us to resolve disputes in jurisdictions with less robust legal systems and may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, environmental, operational, and other risks than we assume in other contracts. These contracts may also expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs or amount of equipment and services contracted to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks. Risks that accompany contracts relating to projects with national oil companies could ultimately have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few major customers. The loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us.\nA substantial percentage of our revenues are generated from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us. In 2018, our largest customer, ENL, accounted for approximately 25.7 percent of our consolidated revenues. Our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers terminate their contracts with us, fail to renew our existing contracts, or do not award new contracts to us.\nA slowdown in economic activity may result in lower demand for our drilling and drilling-related services and rental tools business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA slowdown in economic activity in the United States or abroad could lead to uncertainty in corporate credit availability and capital market access and could reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Concerns about global economic conditions have had a significant adverse impact on domestic and international financial markets and commodity prices, including oil and natural gas. Likewise, economic conditions in the United States or abroad could impact our vendors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to meet obligations to provide materials and services in general. All of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe contract drilling and the rental tools businesses are highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nThe contract drilling and rental tools markets are highly competitive and many of our competitors in both the contract drilling and rental tools businesses may possess greater financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors also are incorporated\nin countries that may provide them with significant tax advantages that are not available to us as a U.S. company and which may impair our ability to compete with them for many projects.\nContract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Many drilling and workover rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, provided market conditions warrant, which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area. Many competitors construct rigs during periods of high energy prices and, consequently, the number of rigs available in some of the markets in which we operate can exceed the demand for rigs for extended periods of time, resulting in intense price competition. Most drilling contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. Historically, the drilling service industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high demand, limited equipment supply and high dayrates often followed by periods of low demand, excess equipment supply and low dayrates. Periods of low demand and excess equipment supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in equipment being idle for long periods of time. During periods of decreased demand we typically experience significant reductions in dayrates and utilization. The Company, or its competition, may move rigs or other equipment from one geographic location to another location; the cost of which may be substantial. If we experience further reductions in dayrates or if we cannot keep our equipment utilized, our financial performance will be adversely impacted. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.\nRig upgrade, refurbishment and construction projects are subject to risks and uncertainties, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe regularly make significant expenditures in connection with upgrading and refurbishing our rig fleet. These activities include planned upgrades to maintain quality standards, routine maintenance and repairs, changes made at the request of customers, and changes made to comply with environmental or other regulations. Rig upgrade, refurbishment, and construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including the following:\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering problems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated change orders;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nunexpectedly long delivery times for manufactured rig components;\n\u2022\nunanticipated repairs to correct defects in construction not covered by warranty;\n\u2022\nfailure or delay of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;\n\u2022\nunforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor or raw materials, particularly steel;\n\u2022\ndisputes with customers, shipyards or suppliers;\n\u2022\nlatent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nfinancial or other difficulties with current customers at shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues associated with downtime to remedy malfunctioning equipment not covered by warranty;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues and payments of liquidated damages for downtime to perform repairs associated with defects, unanticipated equipment refurbishment and delays in commencement of operations; and\n\u2022\nlack of ability to obtain the required permits or approvals, including import/export documentation.\nAny one of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Delays in the delivery of rigs being constructed or undergoing upgrade, refurbishment, or repair may, in many cases, delay commencement of a drilling contract resulting in a loss of revenues to us, and may also cause our customer to renegotiate the drilling contract for the rig or terminate or shorten the term of the contract under applicable late delivery clauses, if any. If one of these contracts is terminated,\nwe may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, actual expenditures for required upgrades or to refurbish or construct rigs could exceed our planned capital expenditures, impairing our ability to service our debt obligations.\nOur international operations are subject to governmental regulation and other risks.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations. In 2018, we derived approximately 56.8 percent of our revenues from operations in countries other than the United States. Our international operations are subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability, war, terrorism, and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\neconomic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government against other countries, groups, or individuals, or economic sanctions imposed by other governments against the U.S. or businesses incorporated in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, and nationalization of our assets;\n\u2022\nforeign laws and governmental regulation, including inconsistencies and unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, and changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nincreases in governmental royalties;\n\u2022\nimport-export quotas or trade barriers;\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining skilled and experienced workers, some of whom are represented by foreign labor unions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ndamage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnapping;\n\u2022\npiracy of vessels transporting our people or equipment;\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in foreign monetary and tax policies;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by government officials for improper payments or other forms of corruption;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u2022\nrepudiation, nullification, modification, or renegotiation of contracts; and\n\u2022\nother forms of governmental regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe currently have operations in 20 countries. Our operations are subject to interruption, suspension, and possible expropriation due to terrorism, war, civil disturbances, political and capital instability, and similar events, and we have previously suffered loss of revenues and damage to equipment due to political violence. Civil and political disturbances in international locations may affect our operations. We may not be able to obtain insurance policies covering risks associated with these types of events, especially political violence coverage, and such policies may only be available with premiums that are not commercially reasonable.\nOur international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of countries with political, regulatory and judicial systems and regimes that may differ significantly from those in the U.S. Our ability to compete in international contract drilling and rental tool markets may be adversely affected by foreign governmental regulations and/or policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which nationals of those foreign countries have substantial ownership interests or by regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Furthermore, our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to us.\nIn addition, tax and other laws and regulations in some foreign countries are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional, and national authorities, which can result in disputes between us and governing authorities. The ultimate outcome of these disputes is never certain, and it is possible that the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nA portion of the workers we employ in our international operations are members of labor unions or otherwise subject to collective bargaining. We may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled and experienced workers for wages and other benefits that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nWe may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received or expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not take protective measures against exposure to a foreign currency. We may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange, or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Given the international scope of our operations, we are exposed to risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation. We attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation where possible by obtaining contracts payable in U.S. dollars or freely convertible foreign currency. In addition, some parties with which we do business could require that all or a portion of our revenues be paid in local currencies. Foreign currency fluctuations, therefore, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the export and re-export of certain goods, services, and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons, and entities. For example, over the past several years the U.S. Government has imposed additional sanctions against Russia\u2019s oil and gas industry and certain Russian companies and individuals. Our ability to engage in certain future projects in Russia or involving certain Russian customers is dependent upon whether or not our involvement in such projects is restricted under U.S. or EU sanctions laws and the extent to which any of our prospective operations in Russia or with certain Russian customers may be subject to those laws. The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control, and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments, unscheduled operational downtime and other operational disruptions. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments, and loss of import and export privileges. Reputational damage can also result from any failure to comply with such obligations.\nOur acquisitions, dispositions, and investments may not result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments, or joint ventures. These transactions are intended to result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the offering of new products or services, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk. These transactions may also affect our consolidated results of operations.\nThese transactions also involve risks, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nany acquisitions would result in an increase in income or earnings per share;\n\u2022\nany acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u2022\nthe due diligence prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, or that we will appropriately quantify the exposure from known risks;\n\u2022\nany disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash flow;\n\u2022\nuse of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses;\n\u2022\nany dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not divert management resources; or\n\u2022\nany dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, could result in fines, criminal penalties, negative commercial consequences and an adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing improper benefits\nfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. However, we operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption. If we are found to be liable for violations of these laws either due to our own acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others (including our joint ventures partners, our agents or other third-party representatives), we could suffer from commercial, civil, and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel could affect our operations.\nWe require skilled, trained, and experienced personnel to provide our customers with the highest quality technical services and support for our drilling operations. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience we require. Competition for skilled labor and other labor required for our operations intensifies as the number of rigs activated or added to worldwide fleets or under construction increases, creating upward pressure on wages. In periods of high utilization, we have found it more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. A shortage in the available labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. Increases in our operating costs could adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, the shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel could negatively affect the quality, safety, and timeliness of our operations. For a description of how the Restructuring could affect our ability to attract and retain personnel, see Risks Related to Our Chapter 11 Proceedings - We may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks associated with our business.\nWe ordinarily maintain insurance against certain losses and liabilities arising from our operations. However, we do not insure against all operational risks in the course of our business. Due to the high cost, high self-insured retention, and limited coverage insurance for windstorms in the GOM we have elected not to purchase windstorm insurance for our inland barges in the GOM. Although we have retained the risk for physical loss or damage for these rigs arising from a named windstorm, we have procured insurance coverage for removal of a wreck caused by a windstorm. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial position, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to hazards customary for drilling operations, which could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately indemnified or insured.\nSubstantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure, and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather, and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations, or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations, and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards. Typically, we are indemnified by our customers for injuries and property damage resulting from these types of events (except for injury to our employees and subcontractors and property damage to ours and our subcontractors\u2019 equipment). However, we could be exposed to significant loss if adequate indemnity provisions or insurance are not in place, if indemnity provisions are unenforceable or otherwise invalid, or if our customers are unable or unwilling to satisfy any indemnity obligations. We may not be able to insure against these risks or to obtain indemnification to adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards and risks described above. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or for which we are not indemnified, or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks. For example, pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Even if such insurance is available, insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future, making the cost of such insurance prohibitive. For a description of our indemnification obligations and insurance, see Item 1. Business - Insurance and Indemnification.\nCertain areas in and near the GOM are subject to hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. When operating in and near the GOM, our drilling rigs and rental tools may be located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage or total loss by these storms. In addition, damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas to our rigs, our shore bases, and our corporate infrastructure could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the effects of the damage can be repaired. In addition, our rigs in arctic regions can be affected by seasonal weather so severe that conditions are deemed too unsafe for operations.\nGovernment regulations may reduce our business opportunities and increase our operating costs.\nGovernment regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee privacy and safety, environmental protection, pollution control, and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, including species protections, prohibit access to some locations and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs, and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations, such as those related to climate change, emissions, and hydraulic fracturing, may discourage our customers\u2019 activities, reducing demand for our products and services. We may be liable for damages resulting from pollution and, under United States regulations, must establish financial responsibility in order to drill offshore. See Item 1. Business - Environmental Considerations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.\nSome scientific studies have suggested that emissions of greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Such studies have resulted in increased local, state, regional, national, and international attention and actions relating to issues of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, particularly emissions from fossil fuels. For example, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the UNFCCC. The U.S. was among 195 nations that participated in the creation of an international accord in December 2015, the Paris Agreement, with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016 and, as of late 2017, had been ratified by 174 of the 197 parties to the UNFCC. However, on August 4, 2017, the United States formally communicated to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from participation in the Paris Agreement, which entails a four-year process. The EPA has also taken action under the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, a number of states have either proposed or implemented restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. International accords such as the Paris Agreement may result in additional regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions. Other developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include but are not limited to the Kyoto Protocol; the European Union Emission Trading System; the United Kingdom\u2019s Carbon Reduction Commitment; and, in the U.S., the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, and various state programs. These regulations could also adversely affect market demand or pricing for our services, by affecting the price of, or reducing the demand for, fossil fuels or providing competitive advantages to competing fuels and energy sources.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business. In addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate-change legislation or regulations, our business also could be negatively affected by climate-change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns. An increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our rigs, impact our ability to conduct our operations and/or result in a disruption of our customers\u2019 operations.\nWe are regularly involved in litigation, some of which may be material.\nWe are regularly involved in litigation, claims, and disputes incidental to our business, which at times may involve claims for significant monetary amounts, some of which would not be covered by insurance. We undertake all reasonable steps to defend ourselves in such lawsuits. Nevertheless, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and any resolution which is adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of the material legal proceedings affecting us.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the demand for rental tools.\nHydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells whereby water, other liquids, sand, and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate natural gas and, oil production. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating, or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly and indirectly. Many state governments require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process and, due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. We do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities. However, these and other developments could cause operational delays or increased costs in exploration and production, which could adversely affect the demand for our rental tools.\nOur operations are subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur operations are becoming increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services. We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage (which may include personal identification information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders), processing, and transmissions, as well as in our interactions with customers and suppliers. Digital technologies are subject to the risk of cyber-attacks, security breaches and other cyber incidents, which could include, among other things, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things: loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data\u037e interruption of our business operations\u037e and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, and other third parties, and may result in claims against us, including liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information. In addition, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to various factors and events, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe other risk factors described in this Form 10-K, including changes in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\na shortfall in rig utilization, operating revenues, or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of the financial performance of us or our competitors or the financial performance of companies in the oilfield service industry generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in actual or market expectations with respect to the amounts of exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the economy and in energy-related industries;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the securities markets;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, terrorism, or war; and\n\u2022\nthe outcome of pending and future legal proceedings, investigations, tax assessments, and other claims.\nFor a description of how the Restructuring could affect the price of our common stock, see \u201cRisks Related to Our Chapter 11 Proceedings\u201d.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and the terms of our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock may be limited by the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our indebtedness. The future payment of dividends on our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K contains certain statements that may be deemed to be \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).
