Risk Factors\nShareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained herein. You should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nBusiness Risks\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if our business assumptions do not prove to be accurate or if adverse changes occur in our business environment, including the following areas:\nEconomic downturn could negatively impact our business, and in a continued downturn with a negative effect on the price of oil and natural gas, our customers may seek to cancel, renegotiate or defer work under our service contracts.\nOur operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions and the condition of the oil and gas industry. Certain economic data indicates that the global economy faces an uncertain outlook. The consequences of a prolonged period of little or no economic growth will likely result in a lower level of activity and increased uncertainty regarding the direction of oil and gas prices and capital markets, which will likely contribute to decreased offshore exploration and drilling. A lower level of offshore exploration and drilling activity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services. In addition, a general decline in economic conditions and demand for energy would also result in lower oil and gas prices, which may also adversely affect demand for and revenues from our services. Likewise, a lower level of offshore activity by oil and gas operators could lead to a surplus of available vessels and therefore downward pressure on the rates we can charge in the market for our services. The extent of the impact of these factors on our results of operations and cash flows depends on the length and severity of the decreased demand for our services and lower oil and gas prices.\nIn the short term, our customers could react to negative market conditions, and may seek to renegotiate their contracts with us or cancel earlier work and shift it to later years, or to cancel their contracts with us even if cancellation involves their paying a cancellation fee. Continued market deterioration could also jeopardize the ability to perform certain counterparty obligations, including those of our insurers, customers and financial institutions. Although we assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties, prolonged business decline or disruptions as a result of economic slow-down or lower oil and gas prices could lead to changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity and increase our exposure to credit risk and bad debts, and in particular, our robotics business unit tends to do business with smaller customers who may not be capitalized to the same extent as larger operators which may lead to more frequent collection issues. In such events, our financial results could be adversely affected and we could incur losses and our liquidity could be negatively impacted.\nOur business is adversely affected by low oil and gas prices in a cyclical oil and gas industry.\nConditions in the oil and gas industry are subject to factors beyond our control. Our services are substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas industry, and in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures for offshore exploration, development, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures generally depends on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, including, but not limited to:\nA sustained period of low drilling and production activity or low oil and gas prices will likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur current backlog for our services may not be ultimately realized, and our contracts may be terminated early.\nAs of December 31, 2014, backlog for our services supported by written agreements or contracts totaled $2.3 billion, of which $591.6 million is expected to be performed in 2015. Although historically our service contracts were of relatively short duration, over the last several years we have been entering into longer term contracts, specifically the BP contract in the Gulf of Mexico and more recently, the Petrobras contract for offshore Brazil. As a consequence, we incur capital costs which we expect to recover over the term of the contracts, we charter vessels over the terms of and for the purpose of performing contracts, and/or we forego other contracting opportunities for the term of these contracts. We may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control. In addition, our customers may seek to cancel, terminate, suspend or renegotiate our contracts in the event of our customers\u2019 diminished demand for our services due to market conditions, some of which contracts provide for a cancellation fee that is substantially less than the expected rates from the contracts. For example, we had two contracts canceled during the second half of 2014, which reduced our backlog for both 2014 and 2015. In addition, some of our customers could experience liquidity issues or could otherwise be unable or unwilling to perform under the contract, which could lead a customer to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate a contract. Our inability or the inability of our customers to perform under our or their contractual obligations, or the early cancellation or termination of our contracts by our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nVessel upgrade, repair and construction projects are subject to risks, including delays, cost overruns, and failure to secure drilling contracts.\nWe are constructing two newbuild semi-submersible well intervention vessels, the Q5000 and the Q7000. We also construct additional ROVs and trenchers from time to time. We may also commence the construction of additional vessels for our fleet in the future without first obtaining service contracts covering any such vessels. Our failure to secure service contracts for vessels or other assets under construction could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDepending on available opportunities, we may construct additional vessels for our fleet in the future. In addition, we incur significant upgrade, refurbishment and repair expenditures on our fleet from time to time. Some of these expenditures are unplanned. These projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:\nDelays in the delivery of vessels being constructed or undergoing upgrades, refurbishment or repair may result in delay in contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue and cash flow to us, and may cause our customers to seek to terminate or shorten the terms of their contract, and/or seek delay damages, under applicable late delivery clauses, if any. For example, the contracts for our chartered vessels in Brazil have significant penalty provisions for late delivery to Petrobras of the vessels which escalate with further delay, and if the vessels are late in delivery to Petrobras beyond a certain date, the contracts also may be terminated. In the event of termination of these and other contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if the contract with Petrobras were to be canceled, we would still be responsible for the charter costs of the two monohull vessels we have contracted to perform this work in Brazil.\nThe estimated capital expenditures for vessels, upgrades, refurbishments and construction projects could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures. Moreover, our vessels undergoing upgrades, refurbishment and repair may not earn a day rate during the period they are out of service. Additionally, as vessels age, they are more likely to be subject to higher maintenance and repair activities and thus suffer lower levels of utilization. Any significant period of unplanned maintenance and repairs related to our vessels could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nTime chartering of our ROV support vessels requires us to make payments regardless of utilization and revenue generation, which could adversely affect our operations.\nMost of our ROV support vessels are under long-term time charter contracts. Should we not have work for those vessels, we are still required to make time charter payments, and making those payments absent revenue generation could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur contracting business typically declines in winter, and bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico or North Sea can adversely affect our operations.\nMarine operations conducted in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea are seasonal and depend, in part, on weather conditions. Historically, we have enjoyed our highest vessel utilization rates during the summer and fall when weather conditions are favorable for offshore exploration, development and construction activities. We typically have experienced our lowest utilization rates in the first quarter. As is common in the industry, we may bear the risk of delays caused by some adverse weather conditions. Accordingly, our results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.\nCertain areas in and near the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea experience unfavorable weather conditions including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis. Substantially all of our facilities and assets offshore and along the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea are susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could potentially cause us to curtail service operations for significant periods of time until damage can be assessed and repaired. Moreover, even if we do not experience direct damage from any of these storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations because customers may curtail their development activities due to damage to their platforms, pipelines and other related facilities.\nThe operation of marine vessels is risky, and we do not have insurance coverage for all risks.\nMarine construction involves a high degree of operational risk. Hazards, such as vessels sinking, grounding, colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions, are inherent in marine operations. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. Damage arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful liability claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts and limitations for wind storm damages. The current insurance on our vessels is in amounts approximating replacement value. In the event of property loss due to a catastrophic marine disaster, mechanical failure, collision or other event, insurance may not cover a substantial loss of revenue, increased costs and other liabilities, and therefore, the loss of any of our large vessels could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us.\nConsistent with standard industry practice, we typically obtain contractual indemnification from our customers whereby they agree to protect and indemnify us for liabilities resulting from various hazards associated with the drilling industry. We can provide no assurance, however, that our customers will be willing or financially able to meet these indemnification obligations. Also, we may choose not to enforce these indemnities because of business reasons.\nEnhanced regulations for deepwater drilling offshore may reduce the need for our services.\nExploration and development activities and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, under enhanced safety standards, in order for an operator to conduct deepwater drilling, it is required to comply with existing and newly developed regulations and standards. The BSEE conducts many inspections of deepwater drilling operations for compliance with its regulations, including but not limited to the testing of blowout preventers, before drilling may commence. Operators also need to comply with the Safety and Environmental Management System (SEMS Rule) within the deadlines specified by the regulation, and ensure that their contractors have SEMS compliant safety and environmental policies. Additionally, each operator must demonstrate that it has containment resources that are available promptly in the event of a deepwater blowout, regardless of the company or operator involved. It is expected that the BOEM and BSEE will continue to issue further regulations regarding deepwater offshore drilling. Our contracting services business, a significant portion of which is in the Gulf of Mexico, provides development services to newly drilled wells, and therefore relies heavily on the industry\u2019s drilling of new oil and gas wells. If the issuance of permits is significantly delayed, or if demand for our services is decreased or delayed because other oil and gas operations are delayed or reduced due to increased costs, demand for our services in the Gulf of Mexico may also decline. Moreover, if our vessels are not redeployed to other locations where we can provide our services at a profitable rate, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially affected.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty the substance or effect of any new or additional regulations in the United States or in other areas around the world including the increase in costs or delays associated with such regulations. If the United States or other countries where we operate enact stricter restrictions on offshore drilling or further regulate offshore drilling and increase costs for our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.\nGovernment Regulation, including recent legislative initiatives, may affect our business operations.\nNumerous federal and state regulations affect our operations. Current regulations are constantly reviewed by the various agencies at the same time that new regulations are being considered and implemented, and could include regulations pertaining to contracting service operators such as ourselves. The regulatory burden upon the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. Potential legislation and/or regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business. Exploration and development activities and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of national (including federal, state and local) and international laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous domestic and foreign governmental agencies issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws that are often complex and costly to comply with and that carry substantial administrative, civil and possibly criminal penalties for failure to comply. Under these laws and regulations, we may be liable for remediation or removal costs, damages and other costs associated with releases of hazardous materials, including oil into the environment, and such liability may be imposed on us even if the acts that resulted in the releases were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.\nA variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives have been introduced in the domestic and international regions in which we operate that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. For example, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and almost one-half of the states already have taken legal measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nIn 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA that greenhouse gases are an \u201cair pollutant\u201d under the federal Clean Air Act and thus subject to future regulation. In December 2009, the EPA issued an \u201cendangerment and cause or contribute finding\u201d for greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act, which allowed the EPA to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Since 2009, the EPA has issued regulations that, among other things, require a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that impose greenhouse gas emission limitations in Clean Air Act permits for certain stationary sources. The EPA has received petitions to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from marine vessels, but we are currently unaware of any rulemaking projects initiated pursuant to the petitions.\nAdditionally, in October 2009, the EPA published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas sources in the United States on an annual basis, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA expanded its greenhouse reporting rule to include onshore petroleum natural gas production, offshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission, underground natural gas storage, liquefied natural gas storage, liquefied natural gas import and export, and natural gas distribution facilities. Under these rules, reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis.\nThese regulatory developments and legislative initiatives may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations, or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and thus there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future. Such environmental liability could substantially reduce our net income and could have a significant impact on our financial ability to carry out our operations.\nThe application of the Jones Act (which regulates the kind of vessels that can carry goods between ports of the US) to offshore oil and gas work in the US is interpreted in large part by letter rulings of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (\u201cCBP\u201d). The cumulative effect of these letter rulings has been to establish a framework for offshore operators to understand when an operation can be carried out by a foreign flag vessel and when it must be carried out by a coastwise qualified US flag vessel. In early 2010, CBP and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), initiated a proposed rulemaking that would have been subject to public comment following publication in the Federal Register. The proposed rulemaking would have largely reversed the holdings of years of letter rulings from the CBP regarding the application of the Jones Act to offshore oil and gas work. The agencies subsequently withdrew the proposed rulemaking before it was published in the Federal Register. If DHS or CBP re-proposes a change to the application of the Jones Act similar to that originally proposed by CBP, and such proposal is adopted, or if CBP issues one or more letter rulings that interprets the Jones Act as being more restrictive to the operation of foreign flag vessels, such a development could potentially lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in instances where we would be required to hire coastwise qualified vessels that we currently do not own, in order to transport certain merchandise to projects on the OCS. This could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and make it more difficult to perform our offshore services in the US.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or foreign anti-bribery legislation could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and the Brazilian Clean Company Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Although we have programs in place covering compliance with anti-bribery legislation, any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and cause certain reputational damage. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets.\nOur operations outside of the United States subject us to additional risks.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations, including, without limitation:\nIn addition, laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect our international operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe oilfield services business in which we operate is highly competitive. Several of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. If other companies relocate or acquire vessels for operations in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Asia Pacific or West Africa regions, levels of competition may increase and our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in a few countries, the national oil companies have formed subsidiaries to provide oilfield services for them, competing with services provided by us. To the extent this practice expands, our business could be adversely impacted.\nLack of access to the credit market could negatively impact our ability to operate our business and to execute our strategy.\nAccess to financing may be limited and uncertain, especially in times of economic weakness. If capital and credit markets are limited, we may incur increased costs associated with any additional financing we may require for future operations. Additionally, if capital and credit markets are limited, this could potentially result in our customers curtailing their capital and operating expenditure programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our vessels and a reduction in fees and/or utilization. In addition, certain of our customers could experience an inability to pay suppliers, including us, in the event they are unable to access capital markets as needed to fund their operations. Likewise, our suppliers may be unable to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations, each of which could adversely affect our operations. Continued lower levels of economic activity and weakness in the credit markets could also adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic objectives and dispose of non-core business assets.\nOur forward-looking statements assume that our lenders, insurers and other financial institutions will be able to fulfill their obligations under our various credit agreements, insurance policies and contracts. If any of our significant financial institutions were unable to perform under such agreements, and if we were unable to find suitable replacements at a reasonable cost, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nOur indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $551.4 million of consolidated indebtedness outstanding. The level of indebtedness may have an adverse effect on our future operations, including:\nA prolonged period of weak economic activity may make it increasingly difficult to comply with our covenants and other restrictions in agreements governing our debt. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by the economic conditions and other events beyond our control. If we fail to comply with these covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to an event of default, the possible acceleration of our repayment of outstanding debt and the exercise of certain remedies by the lenders, including foreclosure against our collateral.\nOur consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk.\nThe reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies. Those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. For instance, we conduct much of our North Sea operations using the British pound, which has recently experienced a sharp decline in its value against the U.S. dollar. Substantial fluctuations in exchange rates could have a significant impact on our results.\nThe loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur industry has lost a significant number of experienced professionals over the years due to its cyclical nature, which is attributable, among other reasons, to the volatility in oil and gas prices. Our continued success depends on the active participation of our key employees. The loss of our key people could adversely affect our operations.\nThe delivery of our services also requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. As a result, our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force, in particular for our expanded well intervention fleet, including meeting any applicable local content requirements that apply when we work in international waters. The demand for skilled workers in our industry is high, and the supply is limited. In addition, although our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the marine services industry has in the past been targeted by maritime labor unions in an effort to organize Gulf of Mexico employees. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of our Gulf of Mexico employees could result in a reduction of our labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth strategy, our results of operations could be harmed.\nOur current strategy is to expand our well intervention and robotics businesses. We must plan and manage our growth effectively to achieve increased revenue and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to effectively manage current and future growth, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In the past, our growth has placed significant demands on our personnel, management and other resources. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, management and legal compliance information systems to keep pace with the planned expansion of our services.\nCybersecurity breaches or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to operate and record aspects of our business. Although we take measures to protect against cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to our confidential and proprietary information, our security measures may not be able to detect or prevent every attempted breach. Similar to other companies, we may be subject to cybersecurity breaches caused by, among other things, illegal hacking, computer viruses, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. A breach could result in an interruption in our operations, unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, violation of privacy or other laws, and exposure to litigation. Any such breach could materially harm our business and operating results.\nCertain provisions of our corporate documents and Minnesota law may discourage a third party from making a takeover proposal.\nOur Articles of Incorporation give our Board of Directors the authority, without any action by our shareholders, to fix the rights and preferences on up to 4,994,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, including dividend, liquidation and voting rights. In addition, our by-laws divide the Board of Directors into three classes. We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. We also have employment arrangements with all of our executive officers that require cash payments in the event of a \u201cchange of control.\u201d Any or all of the provisions or factors described above may discourage a takeover proposal or tender offer not approved by management and the Board of Directors and could result in shareholders who may wish to participate in such a proposal or tender offer receiving less for their shares than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt.\nOther Risks\nOther risk factors could cause actual results to be different from the results we expect. The market price for our common stock, as well as other companies in the oil and gas industry, has been historically volatile, which could restrict our access to capital markets in the future. Other risks and uncertainties may be detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.\nMany of these risks are beyond our control. In addition, future trends for pricing, margins, revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict in the industries we serve and under current market, economic and political conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and, except as required by applicable law, we do not assume any responsibility to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 85168, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "HLX"}
