Before you invest you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report. Any of the risks and uncertainties set forth herein could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the trading price or value of our securities. Additional risks not currently known to us or which we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect us. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred a net loss of $14.1 million and $9.8 million, respectively, and used cash in operations of $11.7 million and $21.0 million, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $118.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Our losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with our design, manufacturing and development activities, research and development activities, building our commercial infrastructure, stock-based compensation, legal, advertising, marketing and investor relations, and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. While we have received a medical device license from Health Canada to market the PoNS device in Canada, and even if we are successful in obtaining marketing authorization from the FDA in order to launch our PoNS device in the United States or additional foreign regulatory authorities to launch outside of the United States, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to research and develop and seek regulatory marketing authorization for our product candidate.\nWe are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources, lack of significant revenue and the risk that we will not achieve our growth objective. If sales revenue from any product candidate that receives marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory body is insufficient, if we are unable to develop and commercialize any of our potential product candidates, or if our product development is delayed, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe will require additional financing to carry out our plan of operations and if we are unable to obtain such financing, our business may fail.\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2020, we have generated over $2.0 million in revenue from the commercial sales of products or services. Because we have generated limited revenues from commercialization, our operations to date have been principally financed through public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible debt and exercises of options and warrants. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations, including but not limited to the recruitment of patients for treatment in Canada, manufacturing of a commercially viable version of the PoNS device and demonstration of effectiveness sufficient to generate commercial orders by customers for our product. Moreover, because we expect that the revenue opportunity in the United States is significantly greater than in Canada, we believe our ability to generate significant revenue in the future will be dependent upon the receipt of FDA marketing authorization of the PoNS device.\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through at least 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. While we had $3.3 million of cash as of December 31, 2020 and received net proceeds of $10.9 million in the aggregate from the exercise of outstanding warrants and the issuance and sale of common stock and warrants in a public offering subsequent to December 31, 2020, we do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish all of the above conditions necessary for us to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability, and we will require additional financing to fund our operations beyond the beginning of the first quarter of 2022. There is no guarantee that such funding will be available at all or in sufficient amounts to satisfy our required expenditures.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing as needed, we may be forced to reduce the scope of our operations and planned capital expenditures or sell certain assets, including intellectual property, and we may be forced to cease or wind down operations, seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or liquidate and dissolve our company, which would have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock.\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities or through debt financings or licensing arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidate on terms unfavorable to us.\nOur operations to date have principally been financed by public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible debt and exercises of options and warrants and, since inception, we have raised $118.9 million in gross proceeds from equity financings. Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidate, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidate, or otherwise grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for our product candidate or our preclinical product candidates, or grant rights to develop and market potential future product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization goals and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements. We may be unable to continue to operate without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future.\nIn connection with our management\u2019s assessment, our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. Future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2022. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect our expenses to increase over time in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we: invest in marketing and distribution capabilities in support of potentially commercializing our PoNS device in the U.S., if approved; make improvements to our manufacturing process and product design; launch the TBI-002 trial or conduct other trials of the PoNS device; pursue further regulatory approvals; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and add additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and investors will likely lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product Candidate\nWe currently only have one product candidate, which is still in development, and we have not obtained authorization from the FDA to commercially distribute the device in the United States, a CE Mark for commercial distribution in Europe or from the TGA for commercial distribution in Australia, and we may never obtain such authorizations.\nWe currently have no products authorized for commercial distribution in either the United States, Europe or Australia, or in any other country outside of Canada. We are developing the PoNS device for use in the neuromodulation market, but we cannot begin marketing and selling the device in the United States, Europe or Australia until we obtain applicable authorizations from the FDA, European Union (Notified Body) or Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, respectively. While we have submitted applications for regulatory marketing authorization in the United States and Australia, the process of obtaining regulatory authorization is expensive and time-consuming and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of a product. Changes in regulatory policy, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the authorization of a product candidate or rejection of a regulatory application altogether.\nIn April 2019, the FDA declined our request for de novo classification of the PoNS device for use to improve balance in patients with mmTBI. In reaching its conclusion, the FDA noted that it did not have sufficient information to discern the relative independent\ncontributions of the PoNS device and physical therapy to establish sufficient evidence of effectiveness based on our clinical trials. In October 2019, we had a pre-submission meeting where the FDA provided feedback needed to help complete the design of a new clinical trial intended to address the FDA\u2019s request for a trial that demonstrates the benefit of the PoNS Treatment compared to physical therapy alone. In January 2020, we received the FDA\u2019s feedback on the minutes from the October 2019 pre-submission meeting. In its feedback, the FDA provided post-meeting notes with specific recommendations regarding the trial design that were not discussed in the October 2019 pre-submission meeting. Based on the receipt of the FDA\u2019s final minutes from the pre-submission meeting, we finalized our clinical protocol for a new trial, TBI-002, intended to support a request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device. The launch of the TBI-002 trial has been temporarily suspended, and we are evaluating our options for funding and timing to commence the trial or potentially look at other indications.\nIn March 2020, we announced that based on the quality of the data included in our MS submission package to Health Canada and the significant unmet needs of those afflicted with MS, we are prioritizing the MS indication as the pathway to pursue our first U.S. clearance of the PoNS device. On May 7, 2020, we received Breakthrough Designation for the PoNS device as a potential treatment for gait deficit due to symptoms of MS, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program. On August 4, 2020, we submitted our request to the FDA for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device for the treatment of gait deficit due to symptoms from MS, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients over 18 years of age.\nOn October 19, 2020, we announced that we received a request for additional information from the FDA related to our request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device, which includes requests for additional analysis of clinical data and proposes certain labeling modifications. On January 11, 2021, we announced that we submitted our formal response to the FDA\u2019s request for additional information.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the de novo review process and may refuse to accept our application or may decide that our data are insufficient to grant the de novo request and require additional pre-clinical, clinical, or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Any marketing authorization from the FDA we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-market commitments that render the product candidate not commercially viable. If our attempts to obtain marketing authorization are unsuccessful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are able to complete development of the PoNS device and obtain marketing authorization of the PoNS device for the treatment of gait deficit in patients with MS in the United States, Europe or Australia, we plan to develop the PoNS device for other indications, or symptoms caused by neurological disorders. We would be required to commit our own resources to fund development of any other indications and each would require separate FDA clearance or other marketing authorization. The costs of such development efforts and FDA clearance or other marketing authorization could be substantial and would likely require additional funding, and each such indication would be subject to the same foregoing risks and uncertainties for FDA clearance/authorization.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to materially and adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic conditions. The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has significantly increased economic uncertainty. Authorities implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and business shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic initially led to the closure of PoNS authorized clinic locations across Canada from March until June 2020. Patients who completed their initial training in the clinics prior to the closures have been able to continue working independently in the at-home portion of the treatment, with remote check-ins with their certified therapists. While all clinics have re-opened, they are all currently operating at reduced capacity within provincial guidelines, which limited operations to 50% capacity during the second half of 2020. Some patients have begun to return to these clinics for treatment, but patients have been and may continue to be less willing to return to the clinics due to COVID-19, impacting our commercial activities and our customer engagement efforts. We have expanded our services to include remote training and treatment, but the long-term viability of these remote programs is still being assessed. In addition, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases across Canada in the fourth quarter of 2020 has led to further restrictions on clinic activities. Additionally, while we do not currently have any clinical trials underway, we are running clinical experience programs in Canada and have experienced delays in the programs as trial participant attendance has generally decreased as a result of the pandemic, and clinics and clinical research sites have experienced delays and difficulties in recruiting and re-hiring clinical site staff, leading to further delays in the development and approval of the Company\u2019s product candidate. As noted above, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our expectation was that we would move forward with the launch of our TBI-002 trial and we had estimated that enrollment would begin in April 2020 with the completion of the trial and submission to the FDA in the second quarter of 2021. However, the launch of the TBI-002 trial has been\ntemporarily suspended and we are evaluating our options for funding and timing to commence the trial or potentially looking at other indications.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks may cause delays in or the suspension of our business partners manufacturing operations, our research and product development activities, our regulatory workstreams, our research and development activities and other important commercial functions. We are also dependent upon our suppliers for the manufacture of our PoNS device, and in the second quarter of 2020, two of our business partners diverted resources towards other activities related to COVID-19, resulting in delays in the development and manufacturing of our product. Such diversion of suppliers\u2019 resources may occur again in the future, and the pandemic could limit our suppliers\u2019 ability to travel or ship materials or force temporary closure of facilities that we rely upon. Disruptions in business operations or governmental operations due to COVID-19 may delay the timing for the submission and approval of the Company\u2019s marketing applications with regulatory agencies. Further, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could affect our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we may experience additional disruptions that could severely impact our business and planned clinical trials including:\n\u2022\nDiversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct on clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nInterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitation on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others;\n\u2022\nDelays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\nChanges in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the way in which clinical trials are conducted and may result in unexpected costs;\n\u2022\nDelays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; and\n\u2022\nDelay in the timing of our interactions with the FDA due to absenteeism by federal employees or the diversion of their efforts and attention to approval of other therapeutics or other activities related to COVID-19.\nIn addition to the risks specifically described above, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and precipitated the other risks described herein, and may continue to do so. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company does not know yet the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on its business, operations or the global economy as a whole.\nOur PoNS technology is a novel form of neurostimulation therapy, and the medical community tends not to adopt new therapies very rapidly. If physicians elect not to prescribe the PoNS Treatment, or if we cannot train physical therapists in the supervision of the use of the PoNS Treatment, we will be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nOur deployment strategy in the United States depends on physicians prescribing the PoNS Treatment to patients with relevant neurological disorders and physical therapists being trained in the supervision of patients\u2019 use of our treatment. Novel technologies are usually more slowly adopted by the medical community, as the medical community tends to be very conservative. Physicians may elect not to use our products for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nlack or perceived lack of evidence supporting the beneficial characteristics of our technology;\n\u2022\nlimited long-term data on the use of PoNS technology for therapy;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 perception that there are insufficient advantages of our product relative to currently available products or compared to supervised therapeutic exercise alone;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively train physical therapists in the supervision of patients\u2019 use of the therapy;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop our commercial infrastructure to successfully launch;\n\u2022\nhospitals may choose not to purchase our product;\n\u2022\ngroup purchasing organizations may choose not to contract for our product, thus limiting availability of our products to hospital purchasers;\n\u2022\nlack of coverage or adequate payment from managed care plans and other third-party payers for our product;\n\u2022\nMedicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers may limit or not permit reimbursement for our product; and\n\u2022\nthe development or improvement of competitive products.\nIf the medical community is slow to adopt, or declines to adopt our PoNS device for neurostimulation therapy, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, if any, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere is limited market awareness of our product, and the neuromodulation market is new and uncertain.\nThere is currently limited market awareness of our product. In order to succeed, we must, among other things, increase market awareness of our PoNS Treatment and implement a sales and marketing strategy. If we fail in any of these endeavors or experience delays in pursuing them, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated. In addition, if the neuromodulation market fails to become more integrated in neurological therapy, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and our competitors may develop devices or products that are more advanced or more effective than ours are which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully market the PoNS device.\nThe neurostimulation market involves rapidly developing technology. Our competitors in the industry are predominantly large companies with longer operating histories, with significantly easier access to capital and other resources and an established product pipeline than us. The combined clinical research and product development done by the industry, including by us and all of our competitors, is foundational, and neurostimulation has slowly become integrated into neurological therapy. This foundation has allowed new and innovative neurostimulation companies to enter the market. New developments occur rapidly, and we anticipate that we will face increasing competition as new companies enter our market.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to establish ourselves in the neurostimulation market, or, if established, that we will be able to maintain our market position, if any. Our commercial opportunity may be reduced if our competitors develop new or improved products that are more convenient, more effective or less expensive than our product candidate is. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory marketing authorization for their products more rapidly or earlier than we may obtain marketing authorization for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render the PoNS device uneconomical or obsolete.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe are, and will continue to be, dependent in significant part on outside scientists and third-party research institutions for our research and development in order to be able to commercialize our product candidate.\nWe currently have a limited number of employees and resources available to perform the research and development necessary to commercialize our PoNS Treatment and potential future product candidates. We therefore rely, and will continue to rely, on third-party research institutions, collaborators and consultants for this capability.\nWe depend on third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our product and the loss of our third-party manufacturer and distributor could harm our business.\nWe depend on our third-party contract manufacturing partner to manufacture and supply our PoNS device for clinical and commercial purposes, and this contract manufacturer manufactured the units for our engineering and device verification testing and is building the launch quantities for commercialization. Additionally, we depend on a different third-party distribution partner to warehouse and ship our products to customers. Our reliance on a third-party manufacturer and a distribution provider to supply us with our PoNS device and to provide such other distribution services exposes us to risks that could delay our sales or result in higher costs or lost product revenues. In addition, our manufacturers could encounter difficulties, including, but not limited to, those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in securing long-lead time components, achieving volume production, quality control and quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, which could result in their inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our commercially available product to meet market demand. Our third-party manufacturer or distributor may also fail to follow and remain in compliance with the FDA-mandated Quality System Regulations, or QSR, compliance which is required for all medical devices, or fail to document their compliance to QSRs, either of which could lead to significant delays in the availability of materials for our product and/or FDA enforcement actions against them and/or us.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our product that meet our specifications and quality standards, it will be difficult for us to compete effectively. While we have supply and quality agreements in place with our manufacturer, they may change the terms of our future orders or choose not to supply us with products in the future. Furthermore, if such manufacturer fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to purchase our product from other third-party manufacturers, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms or in sufficient time, if at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer or the reverification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to produce and distribute our product in a timely manner.\nIn order to be successful, we must expand our product lines beyond our PoNS Treatment for gait deficit due to symptoms from MS or balance deficit due to mmTBI, but we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion and at expected costs, or at all.\nIn order to be successful, we will need to expand our product lines beyond our PoNS Treatment for gait deficit due to symptoms from MS or balance deficit due to mmTBI. To succeed in our commercialization efforts, we must effectively continue product development and testing, obtain regulatory authorizations, and enhance our sales, marketing and market access and reimbursement capabilities. There is no assurance that we will succeed in developing a future product candidate or in bringing any of our current or potential future product candidates to market outside of Canada. If we fail in bringing our product candidates to market, or experience delays in doing so, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated.\nThe development of additional products is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new, state of the art products, and products based on new technologies. These risks include: (a) delays in product development or manufacturing; (b) unplanned expenditures for product development or manufacturing; (c) failure of new products to have the desired effect or an acceptable accuracy and/or safety profile; (d) emergence of superior or equivalent products; (e) failure by any potential collaborative partners to successfully develop products; and (f) the dependence on third parties for the manufacture, development and sale of our products. Because of these risks, our research and development efforts or those of potential collaborative partners may not result in any commercially viable products. If a significant portion of these development efforts is not successfully completed, or any products are not commercially successful, we are less likely to generate significant revenues, or become profitable. The failure to perform such activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf our intellectual property protection is inadequate, competitors may gain access to our technology and undermine our competitive position.\nWe regard our intended and future intellectual property as important to our success, and we intend to rely on patent law to protect our proprietary rights. Despite our precautions, unauthorized third parties may copy certain portions of our devices or products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may seek additional patents in the future. We do not know if any future patent application will be issued with the scope of the claims, we seek, if at all or whether any patents we receive will be challenged or invalidated. Thus, we cannot assure you that any intellectual property rights that we may receive can be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent, as do the laws of the United States. Our means of protecting any proprietary rights we may receive in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop a similar technology. Any failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including intellectual property litigation, such as patent infringement claims, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe, as well as certain of our directors and officers, may be subject to claims or lawsuits. These lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, our commercial success will also depend, in part, on not infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that the technologies and products used or developed by us will not infringe such rights. If such infringement occurs and we are not able to obtain a license from the relevant third party, we will not be able to continue the development, manufacture, use, or sale of any such infringing technology or product. There can be no assurance that necessary licenses to third-party technology will be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms. In some cases, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties. Any potential litigation could result in substantial costs to, and diversion of, our resources and could have a material and adverse impact on us.\nAn adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to cease using the subject technology or require us to license the subject technology from the third party, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere are risks to our intellectual property based on our international business operations.\nWe may face risks to our technology and intellectual property as a result of our conducting business outside of the United States, including as a result of our strategic arrangement with A&B (and subsequent transfer of assets to CMS and CMS Medical Hong Kong Limited), and particularly in jurisdictions that do not have comparable levels of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and customer information and records. While these risks are common to many companies, conducting business in certain foreign jurisdictions, housing technology, data and intellectual property abroad, or licensing technology to joint ventures with foreign partners may have more significant exposure. Pursuant to our agreement with A&B, we transferred ownership of certain of our Asian patents, patent applications, and product support material for the PoNS device from us to A&B and granted to A&B, among other things, an exclusive license to market, promote, distribute and sell the PoNS device solely within specified Asian territories. Subsequently. A&B partnered with other companies in other foreign jurisdictions in connection with the development and manufacturing of the PoNS device, which may expose us to material risks of theft of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets or other sensitive information. For example, our product or components may be reverse engineered by other business partners or other parties, which could result in our patents being infringed or our know-how or trade secrets stolen. The risk can be by direct intrusion wherein technology and intellectual property is stolen or compromised through cyber intrusions or physical theft through corporate espionage, including with the assistance of insiders, or via more indirect routes.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nBefore we can market and sell our products, we will be required to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. These authorizations will take significant time and require significant research, development, and clinical study expenditures, and ultimately may not succeed.\nBefore we begin to label and market the PoNS Treatment for use in the United States, we are required to obtain marketing authorization via a de novo classification and clearance request for our product or approval of pre-market approval application from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. We will also be required to comply with costly and more often time-consuming regulatory requirements by foreign regulatory authorities, including Europe and Australia, if we want to sell our products outside of the United States, other than Canada, where the PoNS Treatment is authorized for sale as a class II, non-implantable, medical device for treatment of gait deficit due to symptoms from MS and balance deficit due to mmTBI in conjunction with supervised therapeutic exercise. The process of obtaining regulatory authorizations or approvals, including completion of the de novo classification process, to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully obtain pre-market reviews on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn April 2019, the FDA declined our request for de novo classification of the PoNS device for use to improve balance in patients with mmTBI. In reaching its conclusion, the FDA noted that it did not have sufficient information to discern the relative independent contributions of the PoNS device and physical therapy to establish sufficient evidence of effectiveness based on our clinical trials. In October 2019, we had a pre-submission meeting where the FDA provided feedback needed to help complete the design of a new clinical trial intended to address the FDA\u2019s request for a trial that demonstrates the benefit of the PoNS Treatment compared to physical therapy alone. In January 2020, we received the FDA\u2019s feedback on the minutes from the October 2019 pre-submission meeting. In its feedback, the FDA provided post-meeting notes with specific recommendations regarding the trial design that were not discussed in the October 2019 pre-submission meeting. Based on the receipt of the FDA\u2019s final minutes from the pre-submission meeting, we finalized our clinical protocol for a new trial, TBI-002, intended to support a request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device. The launch of the TBI-002 trial has been temporarily suspended, and we are evaluating our options for funding and timing to commence the trial or potentially look at other indications.\nIn March 2020, we announced that based on the quality of the data included in our MS submission package to Health Canada and the significant unmet needs of those afflicted with MS, we are prioritizing the MS indication as the pathway to pursue our first U.S. clearance of the PoNS device. On May 7, 2020, we received Breakthrough Designation for the PoNS device as a potential treatment for gait deficit due to symptoms of MS, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program. On August 4, 2020, we submitted our request to the FDA for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device for the treatment of gait deficit due to symptoms from MS, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients over 18 years of age.\nOn October 19, 2020, we announced that we received a request for additional information from the FDA related to our request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device, which includes requests for additional analysis of clinical data and proposes certain labeling modifications. On January 11, 2021, we announced that we submitted our formal response to the FDA\u2019s request for additional information.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the de novo review process and may refuse to accept our application or may decide that our data are insufficient to grant the de novo request and require additional pre-clinical, clinical, or other studies. In addition, varying\ninterpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nIf the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for the PoNS device for MS or any other indication we may pursue, introducing the product could be delayed or canceled, which would cause our launch to be delayed or cancelled. In addition, the FDA may determine that the PoNS device requires the more costly, lengthy and uncertain pre-market approval process. For example, if the FDA disagrees with our determination that the de novo classification procedures are the appropriate path to obtain marketing authorization for the PoNS device, the FDA may require us to submit a PMA application, which is generally more costly and more burdensome and can take several years from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nMoreover, in addition to continuing our pursuit of an indication for mmTBI with the FDA, we are currently considering the development of the PoNS device for other potential indications, including stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, baby boomers balance, and neurological wellness, as well as expanding the label of our current indications. At this time, we do not know what pathways the FDA or other regulatory authorities will require us to utilize for these additional indications. We may be required to pursue marketing authorization via more rigorous pathways, such as a PMA application in the United States, which may require more development work than we are currently planning. This would delay the potential marketing authorization for such indications, potentially make marketing authorization more difficult to obtain, and increase our costs.\nObtaining FDA marketing authorization will be costly, may result in time-consuming delays and will subject us to ongoing compliance costs and regulatory risk for non-compliance.\nObtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo classification and clearance, or PMA approval for medical devices can be expensive and uncertain, generally takes from several months to several years, and generally requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result in FDA authorization. Even if we were to obtain regulatory authorization, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive, in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny authorization of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our product candidate is safe and effective for its intended users;\n\u2022\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support authorization, where required; and\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its authorization policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay marketing authorization of our products under development. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our product candidate could prevent us from generating revenue from our product candidate and adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nEven if granted, a 510(k) clearance, de novo classification and clearance, or pre-market approval for any future product would likely place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or sold, and FDA will continue to place considerable restrictions on our products and operations. For example, the manufacture of medical devices must comply with FDA\u2019s QSR. In addition, manufacturers must register their manufacturing facilities, list the products with FDA, and comply with requirements relating to labeling, marketing, complaint handling, adverse event and medical device reporting, reporting of corrections and removals, and import and export. FDA monitors compliance with the QSR and these other requirements through periodic inspections. If our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or if we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, the regulatory authority could take enforcement action, including any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications of repair, replacement, refunds, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying requests for marketing authorization of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing marketing authorizations that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusing to provide Certificates for Foreign Government;\n\u2022\nrefusing to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022\npursuing criminal prosecution.\nAdditionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our product candidate and dissuade our customers from using our product candidate, if and when it is authorized for marketing.\nWe may be required to conduct clinical trials to support a future de novo submission or PMA application for the PoNS device and we expect to be required to conduct clinical trials to support regulatory marketing authorization for future product candidates.\nIn order to commercialize our product candidate in the United States, we may be required by the FDA to submit an application for premarket approval, or PMA, for review and approval by the FDA. A PMA application must be submitted to the FDA if our device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process, down classified via the de novo process, or is not exempt from premarket review by the FDA. In April 2019, the FDA declined our request for de novo classification and clearance for mmTBI. Following a pre-submission meeting with the FDA, we finalized our clinical protocol for a new trial, TBI-002, intended to support a request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device. The launch of the TBI-002 trial has been temporarily suspended, and we are evaluating our options for funding and timing to commence the trial or potentially look at other indications.\nIn March 2020, we announced that based on the quality of the data included in our MS submission package to Health Canada and the significant unmet needs of those afflicted with MS, we are prioritizing the MS indication as the pathway to pursue our first U.S. clearance of the PoNS device. On May 7, 2020, we received Breakthrough Designation for the PoNS device as a potential treatment for gait deficit due to symptoms of MS, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program. On August 4, 2020, we submitted our request to the FDA for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device for the treatment of gait deficit due to symptoms from MS, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients over 18 years of age.\nOn October 19, 2020, we announced that we received a request for additional information from the FDA related to our request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device, which includes requests for additional analysis of clinical data and proposes certain labeling modifications. On January 11, 2021, we announced that we submitted our formal response to the FDA\u2019s request for additional information.\nWe could also be required to submit a PMA application for potential future product candidates. If we are required by the FDA to submit a PMA application, the FDA will also require us to conduct clinical trials. We will receive marketing authorization from the FDA to commercialize products requiring a clinical trial only if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, through well designed and properly conducted clinical trials, that our product candidate is safe, effective, and otherwise meet the appropriate standards required for marketing authorization for specified indications.\nWe have and may continue to encounter substantial delays in planned clinical trials, or our planned clinical trials for other indications using the PoNS device may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PoNS device to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nAs described above, following the FDA\u2019s denial of our request for de novo classification and clearance for mmTBI in April 2019, in January 2020 we finalized our clinical protocol for TBI-002 intended to support a request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device for mmTBI. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our expectation was that we would move forward with the revised protocol and estimated that enrollment would begin in April 2020 with the completion of the trial and submission to the FDA in the second quarter of 2021. However, the launch of the TBI-002 trial has been temporarily suspended, and we are evaluating our options for funding and timing to commence the trial or potentially look at other indications.\nWhile we currently have no ongoing clinical trials, we expect that we will need to conduct further clinical trials, including the TBI-002 trial if we continue to pursue de novo classification and clearance for mmTBI in the United States. Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain as to outcome and are subject to substantial and unanticipated delays. Before we may begin clinical trials, if a clinical trial is determined to present a significant risk, we may be required to submit and obtain approval for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, that describes, among other things, the manufacture of, and controls for, the device and a complete investigational plan. Clinical trials generally involve a substantial number of patients in a multi-year study. Because we do not have the infrastructure necessary to conduct clinical trials, we will have to hire one or more contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct trials on our behalf. CRO contract negotiations may be costly and time consuming and we will rely heavily on the CRO to ensure that our trials are conducted in accordance with regulatory and industry standards. We may encounter problems with our clinical trials and any of those problems could cause us or the FDA to suspend those trials or delay the analysis of the data derived from them. Moreover, any failure to abide by the applicable regulatory requirements by us, our CROs, and/or clinical trial sites may result in regulatory enforcement action against such third parties or us.\nWe cannot guarantee that clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trial can occur at any stage of testing. Delays, including, but not limited to those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, can be costly and could negatively affect our ability to complete a clinical trial and may allow our competitors to bring products to market\nbefore we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize the PoNS device. If we are unable to complete such planned clinical trials, or are unsuccessful in doing so, we may be unable to advance the PoNS device to regulatory authorization and commercialization, which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be substantially dependent on third parties to conduct our clinical trials.\nSince we may conduct clinical trials to obtain FDA marketing authorization, we will need to rely heavily on third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and as a result will have limited control over the clinical investigators and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. These third parties and we are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional nonclinical or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications or may subject them or us to regulatory enforcement actions. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials may be required to be conducted with a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory marketing authorization process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting our clinical trials are not and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical, and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory marketing authorization of or successfully commercialize our product candidate. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidate would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nIf any of our relationships terminate with these third-party CROs, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially affect our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our products.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants.\nIf we are unable to secure contracts with WC and third-party administrators or rehabilitation clinics who treat patients with gait deficit due to symptoms from MS or balance issues associated with mmTBI, this could have a negative impact on our intended sales and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOne of our commercialization strategies includes leveraging WC payers to drive early reimbursements and entice Medicaid and commercial payers through third party administrators and rehabilitation clinics. Should we fail in securing such contracts it could have a material adverse effect on our intended sales projections, which would affect our financial conditions and operating results. In addition, until we are successful in engaging WC payers, Medicaid and other third party commercial payers to cover the cost of the PoNS device for their insured customers, we expect our initial sales of the PoNS device will be via cash paid by patients. As a result, we may not be able to sell our PoNS device in commercially reasonable quantities depending on the cost of the device to cash payers.\nIf we are unable to obtain a reimbursement code from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services so that the PoNS device is covered under Medicare and Medicaid, this could have a negative impact on our intended sales and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe plan to submit an application to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a reimbursement code so that the PoNS device is covered under Medicare and Medicaid. However, there can be no assurance that our application will be successful, or that we will be able to obtain a reimbursement code in a timely manner. In the event that we do not obtain a reimbursement code for the PoNS device, our customers may be unable to obtain reimbursement for their purchases under private or government-sponsored insurance plans, which could have a negative impact on our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, Medicare and its administrative contractors as well as other insurers must find that the PoNS device meets their medical necessity requirements for the treatment of patients with mmTBI or they will not pay for the treatment. In addition, there is a risk that the payment amount for the PoNS device is either too low or too high to incentivize customer adoption.\nIf hospitals and other healthcare providers are unable to obtain coverage or adequate reimbursement for procedures performed with our products, our product will not likely be widely used.\nIn the United States, the commercial success of our existing product and any future products will depend, in part, on the extent to which governmental payers at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for procedures utilizing our products. On January 12, 2021, the CMS stated that it is finalizing a new Medicare coverage pathway, Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology, or \u201cMCIT,\u201d for FDA-designated breakthrough medical devices. The MCIT rule will provide national Medicare coverage as early as the same day as FDA market authorization for breakthrough devices and coverage would last for four years. Manufacturers will be able to opt-in to MCIT and choose a start date for coverage anytime within two years from the date of FDA market authorization. Hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase our product for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payers to pay for all or part of the costs and fees associated with our products as part of a \u201cbundled\u201d rate for the associated procedures. The existence of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products and the procedures performed with them by government and private payers is critical to market acceptance of our existing and future products. Neither hospitals nor physicians are likely to use our product and any future products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement for the procedures utilizing our products.\nMany private payers currently base their reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the CMS, which administers the Medicare program. Others may adopt different coverage or reimbursement policies for procedures performed with our products, while some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, have reimbursement policies that vary from state to state, some of which may not pay for the procedures performed with our products in an adequate amount, if at all. A Medicare national or local coverage decision denying coverage for one or more of our products could result in private and other third-party payers also denying coverage for our products. Third-party payers also may deny reimbursement for our products if they determine that a product used in a procedure was not medically necessary, was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payer, or was used for an unapproved use. Unfavorable coverage or reimbursement decisions by government programs or private payers underscore the uncertainty that our product face in the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany hospitals and clinics in the United States belong to group purchasing organizations, which typically incentivize their hospital members to make a relatively large proportion of purchases from a limited number of vendors of similar products that have contracted to offer discounted prices. Accordingly, the commercial success of our products may also depend to some extent on our ability to either negotiate favorable purchase contracts with key group purchasing organizations and/or persuade hospitals and clinics to purchase our product \u201coff contract.\u201d\nThe healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private payers seek to control healthcare costs by paying service providers lower rates. While we believe that hospitals will be able to obtain coverage for procedures using our products, the level of payment available to them for such procedures may change over time. State and federal\nhealthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, closely regulate provider payment levels and have sought to contain, and sometimes reduce, payment levels. Private payers frequently follow government payment policies and are likewise interested in controlling increases in the cost of medical care. In addition, some payers are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments to healthcare providers based on the achievement of documented quality-of-care metrics, cost efficiencies, or patient outcomes. These programs are intended to provide incentives to providers to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources. Because of these programs, and related payer efforts to reduce payment levels, hospitals and other providers are seeking ways to reduce their costs, including the amounts they pay to medical device manufacturers. We may not be able to sell our product profitably if third-party payers deny or discontinue coverage or reduce their levels of payment below that which we project, or if our production costs increase at a greater rate than payment levels. Adverse changes in payment rates by payers to hospitals could adversely affect our ability to market, sell our products, and negatively affect our financial performance.\nIn international markets, medical device regulatory requirements and healthcare payment systems vary significantly from country to country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. We cannot assure you that our products will be considered cost-effective by international third-party payers, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payers\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our product profitably. Any failure to receive regulatory or reimbursement approvals would negatively affect market acceptance of our products in any international markets in which those approvals are being sought.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe do not have a product available for sale in the United States. If, however, we achieve this goal, the availability of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers would mean that many healthcare laws would place limitations and requirements on the manner in which we conduct our business, including our sales and promotional activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities. In some instances, our interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities that occurred prior to commercialization (e.g., the granting of stock options) could have implications at a later date. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others: (i) the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us if we provide coding and billing advice to customers, or under theories of \u201cimplied certification\u201d where the government and qui tam relators may allege that device companies are liable where a product that was paid for by the government in whole or in part was promoted \u201coff-label,\u201d lacked necessary marketing authorization, or failed to comply with good manufacturing practices or other laws; (iii) transparency laws and related reporting and/or disclosures such as the Sunshine Act; and/or (iv) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nOur communications regarding product candidates, even while in development, are subject to extensive government scrutiny. We may be subject to governmental, regulatory and other legal proceedings relative to advertising, promotion, and marketing, and communications with study subjects and healthcare professionals, which could have a significant negative effect on our business.\nWe are subject to governmental oversight and associated civil and criminal enforcement relating to medical device advertising, promotion, and marketing, and such enforcement is evolving and intensifying. Communications regarding our products in development and regarding our clinical trials may subject us to enforcement if they do not comply with applicable laws. In the United States, we are potentially subject to enforcement from the FDA, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. Other parties, including private plaintiffs, also are commonly bringing suit against pharmaceutical and medical device companies. We may be subject to liability based on the actions of individual employees and third-party contractors carrying out activities on our behalf.\nEven after marketing authorization for our product is obtained, we are subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA and equivalent foreign competent authorities. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct post-market studies. These studies can be very expensive and time-consuming to conduct. Failure to complete such studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of clearance or approval and the recall or withdrawal of the product, which could prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States.\nThe FDA has broad enforcement powers, and any regulatory enforcement actions or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some healthcare professionals from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our products.\nWe are also required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, installation and servicing of our marketed products.\nThe FDA enforces these requirements via periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. In addition, in the future, regulatory authorities and/or customers may require specific packaging of sterile products, which could increase our costs and the price of our products.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the product from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nAfter commercialization, a recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of a governmental authority, or a foreign competent authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities such as the competent authorities of the European Economic Area countries or Health Canada have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiencies in our products are found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nThe FDA requires that certain classifications of voluntary recalls of devices be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. Any recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nAny future failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refund, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo clearance, PMA approval, NDA, or BLA of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing clearances or approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nU.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after marketing authorization is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. For example, the recent change in administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration took several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict whether or how these executive actions will be implemented, or whether they will be rescinded or replaced under the current Biden administration. The policies and priorities of a new administration are unknown and could materially impact the regulation governing our products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nAny changes in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current, planned and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval or the failure to receive clearance or approval for any new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing clearance that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nIf our expenses are greater than anticipated, then we will have fewer funds with which to pursue our plan of operations and our financing requirements will be greater than anticipated.\nWe may find that the costs of carrying out our plan of operations are greater than we anticipate. We expect our expenses to increase over time in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we: invest in marketing and distribution capabilities in support of potentially commercializing our PoNS device in the U.S., if approved; make improvements to our manufacturing process and product design; launch the TBI-002 trial or conduct other trials of the PoNS device; pursue further regulatory approvals; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and add additional personnel. Increased operating costs may cause the amount of financing that we require to increase. Investors may be more reluctant to provide additional financing if we cannot demonstrate that we can control our operating costs. There is no assurance that additional financing required as a result of our operating costs being greater than anticipated will be available to us. If we do not control our operating expenses, then we will have fewer funds with which to carry out our plan of operations with the result that our business may fail.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code substantial changes in a corporation\u2019s ownership may limit the amount of net operating losses, or NOLs, that can be utilized annually in the future to offset the corporation\u2019s (and the corporation\u2019s affiliates\u2019) U.S. federal and state taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within any three-year period. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the corporation that underwent the ownership change, immediately before the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect any limitation in future years (including by way of exercising of warrants).\nWe may undertake a study to analyze and determine if any historical ownership changes of us or our subsidiary HMI have occurred to determine if there are any permanent limitations on our ability to utilize NOLs in the future. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred, the limitations on the use of our NOLs could increase our U.S. federal and state tax liability and reduce the amount of\ncash available for distribution to shareholders or otherwise adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or warrants.\nWe may not be able to build an effective distribution network for our product.\nWe currently have very few employees and we may either build internal capabilities or rely on distributors to sell our product. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in building an internal team or entering into and maintaining productive arrangements with an adequate number of distributors that are sufficiently committed to selling our products. The establishment of a distribution network is expensive and time consuming. As we launch new products and increase our marketing effort with respect to existing products, we will need to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled resources with significant technical knowledge. In addition, the commissions we pay for product sales could increase over time, which would result in higher sales and marketing expenses. Furthermore, if we were to rely on distributors, the current and potential distributors may market and sell the products of our competitors. Even if the distributors market and sell our product, our competitors may be able, by offering higher commission payments or other incentives, to persuade these distributors to reduce or terminate their sales and marketing efforts related to our product. The distributors may also help competitors solicit business from our existing customers. Some of our independent distributors may likely account for a significant portion of our sales volume, and, if we were to lose them, our sales could be adversely affected. Even if we engage and maintain suitable relationships with an adequate number of distributors, they may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to, commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products, or ultimately succeed in selling our product.\nExposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the outcome of the referendum on membership in the European Union, could be costly and difficult to comply with and could seriously harm our business.\nIn January 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Brexit has created an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and other European Union countries. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom.\nBrexit may have a significant negative impact on medical device manufacturers such as us. A Notified Body, or NB, that we contracted with as our EU regulatory service provider is located in the UK. CE Mark issued by a UK NB is at risk due to Brexit. Medical device manufacturers such as us with products CE Marked by a UK NB may not be able to place those products on the market until Brexit issues are resolved by the European Commission and local governments. In addition, the acceptance of medical device market authorization from UK NBs by countries outside of the EU, which have traditionally accepted UK NB CE marked products, is at risk of interruption due to Brexit. The complexity of Brexit places a significant burden on UK NBs which may negatively impact their ability to provide market clearance (i.e., CE Marking) reviews and certifications in a timely manner. Delays in CE Marking and delays in the issuance of certificates could delay us from placing our PoNS device on the market outside of the UK including outside of the EU (for those countries that require quality management system certificates and CE approval prior to marketing).\nIn December 2018, we submitted an application for a CE Mark, which, if approved, would allow us to market the PoNS device in the European Union. During the second quarter of 2019, we engaged with regulators in Europe to answer questions that we received from them as part of their review of our PoNS device for CE marking. In August 2019, we withdrew our application from the EU marketing process due to uncertainty in Europe caused by the switch from the Medical Device Directive, or MDD, to the Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, Brexit, and the withdrawal of Lloyd\u2019s Register Quality Assurance, our notified body, from the EU notified body business. We have engaged G-MED NA (North America) as our new ISO registrar and new notified body and will reconsider submitting to the EU when conditions stabilize.\nAs a result of the use of our product candidates in clinical trials, and through the sale of our products, we may be liable for product liability claims and we may not carry sufficient product liability insurance.\nThe PoNS device and any devices and product candidates that we may develop in the future may expose us to potential liability from personal injury claims by clinical trial subjects and, if commercially sold, end-users of the product. We maintain clinical trial liability insurance and carry product liability insurance to protect us against the risk that in the future a product liability claim or product recall could materially and adversely affect our business. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our intended product. We cannot assure you that when we commence distribution of our product that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate coverage on acceptable terms, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could materially and adversely affect our reputation and prospects and divert management\u2019s time and attention. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our future products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under federal securities laws and we cannot be certain whether the reduced reporting requirements applicable to such companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company so long as our public float remains less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently-completed second fiscal quarter. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or be more volatile.\nInvestors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nAs long as we remain a non-accelerated filer, we are exempt from the attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent auditors pursuant to section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 but are required to make our own internal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses, such as the material weakness we identified in October 2019, could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting.\nInvestors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be harmed, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nSeveral people who work for us on a part-time consulting basis may be subject to conflicts of interest.\nSeveral people who provide services to us are part-time consultants. Each may devote part of his working time to other business endeavors, including consulting relationships with other corporate entities, and may have responsibilities to these other entities. Because of these relationships, some of the persons who provide services to us may be subject to conflicts of interest. Such conflicts may include deciding how much time to devote to our affairs, as well as what business opportunities should be presented to us.\nWe have been the victim of a cyber-related crime and our controls may not be successful in avoiding further cyber-related crimes in the future.\nIn October 2019, we were the victim of a business email compromise fraud which resulted in our incurring a loss of approximately $0.1 million. We are working with law enforcement authorities and the banks involved in the wire transfer to pursue recovery of the $0.1 million, but at this time while law enforcement officials have identified the source of the scam, we do not know whether we will be able to recover any of the funds, and we have been advised that it may take several months before we are better able to evaluate our recovery prospects.\nEnhancements have been made to our controls relating to electronic payments by or for us that we believe will reduce our risk of becoming a victim of future frauds related to our payments, including by wire transfers. However, cyber-related criminal activities continue to evolve and increase in sophistication, frequency and severity. As a result, the control enhancements that have been made, and any additional enhancements that may be made in the future, to our controls may not be successful in avoiding our becoming a victim to further cyber-related crimes.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions (including ransomware attacks) over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. No network or system can ever be completely secure, and the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs for an indeterminate period of time. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In some cases, data cannot be reproduced. To the extent that any disruption or\nsecurity breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, and the further development of the PoNS device or any future product candidate could be delayed. If a security breach results in the exposure or unauthorized disclosure of personal information, we could incur additional costs associated with data breach notification and remediation expenses, investigation costs, regulatory penalties and fines, and legal proceedings. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to such breaches or attacks. In October 2019, we were the victim of a business email compromise, fraud which resulted in our incurring a loss of approximately $0.1 million.\nChallenges to our tax positions in U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdictions, the interpretation and application of recent U.S. tax legislation or other changes in U.S. or non-U.S. taxation of our operations could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nWe operate, or intend to operate, in a number of tax jurisdictions globally, including in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in several other countries, and we therefore are or will be subject to review and potential audit by tax authorities in these various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and challenge our tax positions. Successful unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate, result in additional taxes or other costs or have other material consequences, which could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nOur effective tax rate may also change from year to year or vary materially from our expectations based on changes or uncertainties in the mix of activities and income allocated or earned among various jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and the applicable tax rates in these jurisdictions (including future tax laws that may become material), tax treaties between countries, our eligibility for benefits under those tax treaties and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such changes could result in an increase in the effective tax rate applicable to all or a portion of our income, impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits or make other changes that may adversely affect our business, cash flows or financial performance. For example, if we are unable to fully realize the benefit of interest expense incurred in future periods as a result of recent tax law changes (as discussed below), we may need to recognize a valuation allowance on any related deferred tax assets, which would impact our annual effective income tax rate.\nIn particular, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, or TCJA, was signed into law. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, or the Section 965 Transition Tax. Certain changes established by the TCJA increased our effective tax rate in prior years, including a new income inclusion item for global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, and the Section 965 Transition Tax on our accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets. Additional changes have impacted the timing of our recognition of certain items of loss and deduction, including a new limitation on the company\u2019s deduction for business interest expense, a new limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of NOL carrybacks for NOLs arising after December 31, 2017 and the allowance of the indefinite carryforward of such NOLs, and increased bonus depreciation from 50% to 100% for certain qualified property.\nFurthermore, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted on March 27, 2020 in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and its consequences. The CARES Act introduced substantial changes to the U.S. tax code, the overall impact of which on our business is uncertain. For example, among other changes, the CARES Act increased the interest expense deductibility limitations and waived certain limitations on the use of NOLs, in each case, temporarily.\nOn July 23, 2020, final regulations were published that exempt certain income subject to a high rate of foreign tax from inclusion under GILTI for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\nThe cumulative impact of these and other changes in tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of these changes on holders of our securities is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe reverse split of our common stock effected on December 31, 2020 could decrease our total market capitalization and has increased, and may continue to increase, the volatility of our stock price.\nAt a special meeting of our stockholders on December 28, 2020, our stockholders approved a reverse split of our outstanding common stock at a ratio in the range of 1-for-5 to 1-for-35. Following such special meeting, our board of directors approved a 1-for-35 reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. We filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split was effective as of 5:00 pm\nEastern Time on December 31, 2020, and our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 4, 2021.\nThere can be no assurance that the total market capitalization of our common stock after the reverse stock split will be equal to or greater than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split or that the per share market price of our common stock following the reverse stock split will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. Furthermore, a decline in the market price of our common stock after the reverse stock split may result in a greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split, and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected following such a reverse stock split.\nThe reverse stock split increased the Company\u2019s authorized but unissued shares of common stock, which could negatively impact a potential investor.\nBecause the number of authorized shares of the Company\u2019s common stock was not reduced proportionately, the reverse stock split increased the Board\u2019s ability to issue authorized and unissued shares without further stockholder action. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and relative voting power and may cause a decline in the trading price of the common stock. The Company could use the shares that are available for future issuance in dilutive equity financing transactions, or to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of management, including transactions that are favored by a majority of the stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices or benefit in some other manner.\nWe could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, which could seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding maintaining a minimum share price, director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards.\nOn March 23, 2020, we received a Notice from the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that, based on the closing bid price of the common stock for the 30 consecutive business days preceding the Notice, we no longer meet Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). The Notice does not result in the immediate delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance. In order to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.\nOn April 17, 2020, we received the Second Notice for the Staff of Nasdaq stating that the 180-day period to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement has been extended due to the global market impact caused by COVID-19. More specifically, Nasdaq has stated that compliance periods were suspended from April 16, 2020 until June 30, 2020. On July 1, 2020, companies received the balance of any pending compliance period to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. As a result of this extension, we were given to until December 3, 2020 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nOn December 4, 2020, we received notice from the Staff indicating that we were not eligible for an additional 180 day extension to meet the Minimum Bid Price Rule. As a result, the Staff determined that our securities would be subject to delisting unless we timely requested a hearing before the Panel. We timely submitted a request for a hearing before the Panel, which request stayed any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq at least until the hearing process concluded and any extension granted by the Panel expired. On January 15, 2021, we received a notice from the Staff that our bid price deficiency had been cured, and that we were in compliance with all applicable listing standards, and so the scheduled hearing before the Panel was cancelled.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that we will remain compliant with the requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf we cease to be eligible to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market:\n\u2022\nWe may have to pursue trading in the United States on a less recognized or accepted market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the \u201cpink sheets\u201d;\n\u2022\nShares of our common stock could be less liquid and marketable, thereby reducing the ability of stockholders to purchase or sell our shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically;\n\u2022\nOur common stock may be deemed a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and transactions in our common stock would be more difficult and cumbersome;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all, as companies trading on alternative markets may be viewed as less attractive investments with higher associated risks, such that existing or prospective institutional investors may be less interested in, or prohibited from, investing in our common stock; and\n\u2022\nThe market price of the common stock may further decline.\nAn active trading market for our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market may not continue to develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors in our common stock to sell their shares of our common stock without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell the shares at all.\nTrading of our common stock could be sporadic, and the price of our common stock may be volatile; we caution you as to the highly illiquid nature of an investment in our shares.\nOur common stock has been listed on the TSX since April 18, 2016 and on The Nasdaq Capital Market since April 11, 2018. Securities of microcap and small-cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the companies\u2019 financial performance or prospects. We believe that trading in our stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to significant volatility. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. Factors unrelated to our performance that may affect the price of our common stock include the following: the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow us, a reduction in trading volume and general market interest in our common stock may affect an investor\u2019s ability to trade significant numbers of shares of our common stock; the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our common stock. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long-term value. The price of our common shares may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including: changes in financial estimates; our acquisitions and financings; quarterly variations in our operating results; the operating and share price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; and purchase or sale of blocks of our common stock. These factors, or any of them, may materially adversely affect the prices of our common shares regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock is affected by many other variables which are not directly related to our success and are, therefore, not within our control. These include other developments that affect the breadth of the public market for shares of our common stock and the attractiveness of alternative investments. The effect of these and other factors on the market price of our common stock is expected to make our common stock price volatile in the future, which may result in losses to investors.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change of control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u2022\nstockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 66 2\u20443% vote and only for cause;\n\u2022\nstockholders are not be permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u2022\nstockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nstockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a\nchange of control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. For example, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near the State of Delaware. The Court of Chancery and federal district courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Some companies that adopted a similar federal district court forum selection provision are currently subject to a suit in the Chancery Court of Delaware by stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable. If a court were to find either choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that the exclusive forum provision of federal district courts of the United States of America for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. As a result of this decision, we do not currently intend to enforce the federal forum selection provision in our certificate of incorporation, unless the decision is reversed on appeal. However, if the decision is reviewed on appeal and ultimately overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court, we would enforce the federal district court exclusive forum provision.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, significantly reforms the Code. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to U.S. federal corporate income taxation, including reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks for net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and creating, modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Federal net operating losses arising in taxable year ending after December 31, 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the TCJA. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nGeneral Risks\nWe have not paid any dividends and do not foresee paying dividends in the future.\nWe intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be reviewed periodically by\nthe board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, conditions then existing including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business opportunities and other factors.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise any required working capital and adversely affect our operations.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise any required capital for our operations. Because our operations to date have been principally financed through public and private offerings of our common stock and exercises of options and warrants, a decline in the price of our common stock could have an adverse effect upon our liquidity and our continued operations. A reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future may have a material adverse effect upon our business plans and operations. If our stock price declines, we may not be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the ability and expertise of our management team and a very limited number of employees and the loss of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe currently have a very small management team. Our success is dependent upon the ability, expertise and judgment of our senior management. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 17690, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "HSDT"}
