{"cik": "949721", "company": "Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND OUR INDUSTRY\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY LAWS, WHICH RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS AND INCREASE OUR COSTS.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health. These include, among other things, laws and regulations governing the use, treatment, storage and disposal of wastes and materials, air quality, water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances. Our compliance with existing regulatory requirements is costly, and continued changes in these regulations could increase our compliance costs. Government laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment. We are required to obtain and maintain permits that are subject to strict regulatory requirements and are difficult and costly to obtain and maintain. We may be unable to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these laws and regulations. In addition, regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post-closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums over the amounts that we have accrued. In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.\nWE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP COSTS OR LITIGATION THAT COULD CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND MATERIALLY DECREASE OUR EARNINGS.\nCERCLA, and analogous state laws provide for the remediation of contaminated facilities and impose strict joint and several liability for remediation costs on current and former owners or operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance. This liability is also imposed on persons who arrange for the disposal of and who transport such substances to the facility. Hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under CERCLA and their presence, even in small amounts, can result in substantial liability. The expense of conducting a cleanup can be significant. Notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances, we may have liability because these substances may be present in waste collected by us. The actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than the amounts that we might be required to accrue on our financial statements from time to time.\nIn addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations, we may incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties. As a result, we may be required to pay fines or our permits and licenses may be modified or revoked. We may in the future be a defendant in lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and private parties who assert claims alleging environmental damage, personal injury, property damage and/or violations of permits and licenses by us. A significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could curtail our business operations and may decrease our earnings.\nOUR BUSINESS IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE, REQUIRING ONGOING CASH OUTLAYS THAT MAY STRAIN OR CONSUME OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL AND FORCE US TO SELL ASSETS, INCUR DEBT, OR SELL EQUITY ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS.\nOur ability to remain competitive, grow and maintain operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital. Maintaining our existing operations and expanding them through internal growth or acquisitions requires large capital expenditures. As we undertake more acquisitions and further expand our operations, the amount we expend on capital will increase. These increases in expenditures may result in lower levels of working capital or require us to finance working capital deficits. We intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility, if necessary. However, we may require additional equity or debt financing to fund our growth.\nWe do not have complete control over our future performance because it is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. It is possible that our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we may not otherwise have the capital resources, to allow us to make necessary capital expenditures. If this occurs, we may have to sell assets, restructure our debt or obtain additional equity capital, which could be dilutive to our stockholders. We may not be able to take any of the foregoing actions, and we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us or our stockholders.\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MAY RESULT IN THE FORECLOSURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 PLEDGED ASSETS AND OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.\nPursuant to the current Credit Agreement, the Lenders have agreed to extend certain credit facilities to the Company, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $89,100,000, consisting of $65,500,000 aggregate principal amount of Tranche A Term Loans (the \u201cTranche A Term Loans\u201d), $8,600,000 aggregate principal amount of Tranche B Term Loans (the \u201cTranche B Term Loans\u201d), $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of MultiDraw Term Loans (the \u201cMDTL Term Loans\u201d), and up to $5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans (the \u201cRevolving Loans \u201d and, together with the Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and the MDTL Term Loans, the \u201cLoans\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding principal balance of $43,195,000 under the Loans as in effect at such time, which is secured by a first position security interest in substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets in favor of Goldman Sachs Specialty Group, LP (\u201cGS\u201d), as collateral agent, for the benefit of the lenders and other secured parties. The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a number of covenants, including restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness\u037e create or permit liens on assets\u037e make investments\u037e and pay dividends. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios set forth in the Credit Agreement and related documents or the occurrence of certain other specified events could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement (an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d). Events of Default under the Credit Agreement also include, without limitation, the Company\u2019s failure to make payments when due, defaults under other agreements, bankruptcy, changes of control and termination of a material contract. Due to our recent failures to comply with the leverage ratio and certain other covenants required under the Prior Credit Agreement, we entered into several amendments thereto. Any future Event(s) of Default under the Credit Agreement, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt, potential foreclosure on our assets and other adverse consequences.\nIF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVERAGE RATIOS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ME BE UNABLE TO DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FUNDS PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NEED TO SEEK OTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL, WHICH COULD BE ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS.\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s failure historically to comply with the leverage ratio under the Prior Credit Agreement, the Company was able to draw down additional funds under the Prior Credit Agreement solely as the result of the execution of the Fourth Amendment. Although the Credit Agreement currently provides for increased leverage ratios, in the future, the Company may not be able to draw down additional funds pursuant to the Credit Agreement until such time as either such leverage ratio complies with the requirements of the Credit Agreement and the Company can show that it reasonably expects to be in pro forma compliance with such ratios or the requisite lenders under the Credit Agreement waive such requirement or otherwise consent to advance additional funds (the Lenders under our Credit Agreement having no requirement to grant such a consent or waiver and there can be no assurance that any such consent or waiver would be forthcoming). Due to certain unanticipated delays in integration of landfill operations, including due to flooding in the St. Louis area in December 2015, the Company had historically not been able to maintain the leverage ratios set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain leverage ratios under the Credit Agreement may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the Company is unable to draw down additional funds pursuant to the Credit Agreement, it may be required to seek other sources of capital, and such capital may only be available on terms that are substantially less favorable than the terms of the Credit Agreement.\nWE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR OUR REVENUE.\nAt this time, the Company has a municipal contract that accounts for 11% of our long term contracted revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Because we depend on this customer for a large portion of our revenue, a loss of this customer could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. If this customer were to cease using our services, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES MAY ENACT CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS TO OPERATE.\nEnvironmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Congress has considered recent proposed legislation directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and President Obama had indicated his support of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. EPA has proposed rules to regulate greenhouse gases, regional initiatives have formed to control greenhouse gases and certain of the states in which we operate are contemplating air pollution control regulations that are more stringent than existing and proposed federal regulations, in particular the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely affect our collection operations. Changing environmental regulations could require us to take any number of actions, including the purchase of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution control technology, and could make some operations less profitable, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES.\nWe risk incurring significant environmental liabilities in connection with our use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations are found to cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. Under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. This risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. Further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us. Additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL AND SAFETY RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY TO EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.\nProviding environmental and waste management services, including operating landfills, involves risks such as vehicular accidents and equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. Additionally, there are risks associated with waste mass instability and releases of hazardous materials or odors. There may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface chemical reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. Any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction.\nWhile we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any such incidents could also adversely impact our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense.\nINCREASES IN THE COSTS OF FUEL MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nThe price and supply of fuel needed to run our collection vehicles is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Any significant price escalations or reductions in the supply could increase our operating expenses or interrupt or curtail our operations. Failure to offset all or a portion of any increased fuel costs through increased fees or charges would reduce our operating margins.\nCHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WOULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.\nOur acquisitions could require us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which will increase our interest expense. Further, to the extent that these borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest, increases in interest rates will increase our interest expense, which will affect our profitability. We bear exposure to, and are primarily affected by, changes in LIBOR rates.\nINCREASES IN THE COSTS OF DISPOSAL MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nIn 2016, we disposed of approximately 70% of the waste that we collect in landfills operated by others, and that rate may not decrease significantly in the future. We may incur increases in disposal fees paid to third parties. Failure to pass these costs on to our customers may reduce our operating margins. In December 2015, the Company purchased Eagle Ridge Landfill, LLC and, in February 2017, the Company purchased two landfills located in Virginia, as part of the Company\u2019s strategy to internalize a majority of its volume. As of July 2016, the Company has begun to move its volume away from third party landfills. Going forward, the Company may not internalize its volume in its own landfills to the extent desired, which may limit the expected savings it anticipated from the acquisition of Eagle Ridge Landfill, LLC and the CFS Group.\nINCREASES IN THE COSTS OF LABOR MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nWe compete with other businesses in our markets for qualified employees. A shortage of qualified employees would require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages to compete more effectively for employees or to hire more expensive temporary employees. Labor is our second largest operating cost, and even relatively small increases in labor costs per employee could materially affect our cost structure. Failure to attract and retain qualified employees, to control our labor costs, or to recover any increased labor costs through increased prices we charge for our services or otherwise offset such increases with cost savings in other areas may reduce our operating margins.\nINCREASES IN COSTS OF INSURANCE WOULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nOne of our largest operating costs is for insurance coverage, including general liability, automobile physical damage and liability, property, employment practices, pollution, directors and officers, fiduciary, workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in our primary general liability, automobile liability and employer\u2019s liability policies. Changes in our operating experience, such as an increase in accidents or lawsuits or a catastrophic loss, could cause our insurance costs to increase significantly or could cause us to be unable to obtain certain insurance. Increases in insurance costs would reduce our operating margins. Changes in our industry and perceived risks in our business could have a similar effect.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT INSURANCE COVERAGE TO COVER THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNINSURED LOSSES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nIntegrated non-hazardous waste companies are exposed to a variety of risks that are typically covered by insurance arrangements. However, we may not be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage to cover the risks associated with our operations for a variety of reasons. Increases in insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets may, given our resources, limit the coverage that we are able to maintain or prevent us from insuring against certain risks. Large or unexpected losses may exceed our policy limits, adversely affecting our results of operations, and may result in the termination or limitation of coverage, exposing us to uninsured losses, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition.\nOUR FAILURE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH OUR NUMEROUS COMPETITORS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OBTAIN FUTURE BUSINESS.\nBecause our industry is highly competitive, we compete with large companies and municipalities, many of whom have greater financial and operational resources. The non-hazardous solid waste collection and disposal industry includes large national, publicly-traded waste management companies; regional, publicly-held and privately-owned companies; and numerous small, local, privately-owned companies. Additionally, many counties and municipalities operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities and have competitive advantages not available to private enterprises. If we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors, our ability to retain existing customers and obtain future business could be adversely affected.\nWE MAY LOSE CONTRACTS THROUGH COMPETITIVE BIDDING, EARLY TERMINATION OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICES IN ORDER TO RETAIN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, ANY OF WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR REVENUE TO DECLINE.\nWe are party to contracts with municipalities and other associations and agencies. Many of these contracts are or will be subject to competitive bidding. We may not be the successful bidder, or we may have to substantially lower prices in order to be the successful bidder. In addition, some of our customers may terminate their contracts with us before the end of the contract term. If we are not able to replace revenue from contracts lost through competitive bidding or early termination or from lowering prices or from the renegotiation of existing contracts with other revenue within a reasonable time period, our revenue could decline.\nMunicipalities may annex unincorporated areas within counties where we provide collection services, and as a result, our customers in annexed areas may be required to obtain service from competitors who have been franchised or contracted by the annexing municipalities to provide those services. Some of the local jurisdictions in which we currently operate grant exclusive franchises to collection and disposal companies, others may do so in the future, and we may enter markets where franchises are granted by certain municipalities. Unless we are awarded a franchise by these municipalities, we will lose customers, which will cause our revenue to decline.\nWe are currently pursuing through a bidding process the renewal of an agreement to which we are currently party, for the operation of a transfer station, scheduled to expire in the fourth quarter of 2016. If we are not awarded renewal of this agreement, we will be forced to utilize other transfer stations which would cause our revenue to decline.\nEFFORTS BY LABOR UNIONS TO ORGANIZE OUR EMPLOYEES COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.\nWe do not have any union representation in our operations. Groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, we might have to wait through \u201ccooling off\u201d periods, which are often followed by union-initiated work stoppages, including strikes. Depending on the type and duration of these work stoppages, our operating expenses could increase significantly.\nPOOR DECISIONS BY OUR REGIONAL AND LOCAL MANAGERS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS OR AN INCREASE IN COSTS, OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUTURE BUSINESS.\nWe manage our operations on a decentralized basis. Therefore, regional and local managers have the authority to make many decisions concerning their operations without obtaining prior approval from executive officers. Poor decisions by regional or local managers could result in the loss of customers or an increase in costs, or adversely affect our ability to obtain future business.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO FACTORS AFFECTING OUR LOCAL MARKETS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS.\nBecause the non-hazardous waste business is local in nature, our business in one or more regions or local markets may be adversely affected by events and economic conditions relating to those regions or markets even if the other regions of the country are not affected. As a result, our financial performance may not compare favorably to our competitors with operations in other regions, and our stock price could be adversely affected by our inability to compete effectively with our competitors.\nSEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS WILL CAUSE OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO VARY AMONG QUARTERS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.\nBased on historic trends experienced by the businesses we have acquired, we expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenue typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters, and again lower in the fourth quarter. This seasonality generally reflects the lower volume of waste during the winter months. Adverse weather conditions negatively affect waste collection productivity, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. The general increase in precipitation during the winter months increases the weight of collected waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, as costs are often calculated on a per ton basis. Because of these factors, we expect operating income to be generally lower in the winter months. As a result, our operating results may be negatively affected by these variations. Additionally, severe weather during any time of the year can negatively affect the costs of collection and disposal and may cause temporary suspensions of our collection services. Long periods of inclement weather may interfere with collection operations and reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers. Any of these conditions can adversely affect our business and results of operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE KEY EMPLOYEES OR GROUPS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND PREVENT US FROM IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN A TIMELY MANNER.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jeffrey S. Cosman. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Cosman. We maintain a key person life insurance policy on Mr. Cosman. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.\nWE HAVE IDENTIFIED A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS, WHICH COULD CAUSE STOCKHOLDERS AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nCurrently, the Company has an Audit Committee to oversee the financial reporting process; however, for much of the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company did not have an Audit Committee. Accordingly, based on these material weaknesses, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective during the period covered by this report, December 31, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules.\nTo address these weaknesses, the Company's management has added independent Directors so that the Company will have an Audit Committee that meets regulatory requirements for independence and financial expert experience. The Company also started the process of retaining additional staff to assist its internal staff with compliance issues.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING REGULATIONS REGARDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE THAT HAVE INCREASED BOTH OUR COSTS AND THE RISK OF NON-COMPLIANCE.\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. Our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed.\nWE NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS.\nThe development of our services will require the commitment of substantial resources to implement our business plan. In addition, substantial expenditures will be required to enable us to complete projects in the future. Currently, we have a credit agreement with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group. However, it is likely we would need to seek additional financing through subsequent future private or public offerings of our equity securities or through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners.\nWe cannot give any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If adequate additional financing is not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business development plan or continue our business operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES\nTHE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO BE VOLATILE AND COULD SUBJECT US TO LITIGATION.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nvariations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n\u25cf\nissuances of new stock which dilutes earnings per share;\n\u25cf\nforward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share;\n\u25cf\nthe net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ntrading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industries even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are to become the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nTHE OWNERSHIP BY OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK WILL LIKELY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE CORPORATE MATTERS.\nMr. Jeffrey S. Cosman, our chief executive officer, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, our chief executive officer would have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. In addition, Mr. Cosman beneficially owns approximately 18% of our issued and outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nALTHOUGH OUR SHARES AND WARRANTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, OUR SHARES MAY BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL DELISTING IF WE DO NOT MEET OR CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE LISTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET.\nOur shares and warrants have been approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d)\u037e however Nasdaq has rules for continued listing, including, without limitation, minimum market capitalization and other requirements. Failure to maintain our listing, or delisting from Nasdaq, would make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of our common stock and more difficult to obtain accurate price quotations on our common stock. This could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our ability to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or otherwise to arrange for any financing we may need in the future, may also be materially and adversely affected if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange.\nOur stock price could fall and we could be delisted from NASDAQ in which case because they may be considered penny stocks and thus be subject to the penny stock rules, WHICH COULD RESULT IN U.S. broker-dealers BECOMING discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restricts transactions involving stock which is deemed to be penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market if current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Our securities have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d\nStockholders should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.\nTHERE MAY BE RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR ABILITY TO RESELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER RULE 144.\nCurrently, Rule 144 under the Securities Act permits the public resale of securities under certain conditions after a six or twelve month holding period by the seller, including requirements with respect to the manner of sale, sales volume restrictions, filing requirements and a requirement that certain information about the issuer is publicly available. At the time that stockholders intend to resell their shares under Rule 144, there can be no assurances that we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) or, if so, current in our reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, in order for stockholders to be eligible to rely on Rule 144 at such time.\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements of Rule 144 under the Federal securities laws, the various state securities laws may impose further restrictions on the ability of a holder to sell or transfer the shares of common stock.\nSALES OF OUR CURRENTLY ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING STOCK MAY BECOME FREELY TRADABLE PURSUANT TO RULE 144 AND MAY DILUTE THE MARKET FOR YOUR SHARES AND HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE PRICE OF THE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nA substantial majority of our outstanding shares of common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that an Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144(a)(1)) of an issuer who has held restricted securities for a period of at least six months (one year after filing Form 10 information with the SEC for shell companies and former shell companies) may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of a company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale (the four calendar week rule does not apply to companies quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board). Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitation, by a person who is not an Affiliate of the Company and who has satisfied a one-year holding period. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares of common stock, may have a depressive effect upon the price of our shares of common stock in any active market that may develop.\nYOU MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION OF YOUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST BECAUSE OF THE FUTURE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR PREFERRED STOCK.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 80,000,000 shares of capital stock, which includes 4,861,468 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.001, for which the designations, rights and preferences may be established by the Board.\nWe may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are trading.\nPOSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECT OF ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 4,861,468 shares are available for issuance, with designations, rights and preferences as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. As a result of the foregoing, the Board of Directors can issue, without further shareholder approval, Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of Common Stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock could, under certain circumstances, discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nWE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT BUY OUR COMMON STOCK EXPECTING TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock in the past, and do not anticipate that we will declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors will only realize an economic gain on their investment in our common stock if the price appreciates. Investors should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Because we do not pay dividends, and there may be limited trading, investors may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on their investment. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause investors to not see any return on investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends we may have trouble raising additional funds, which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.", "PERMNO": 82476, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "ATIS"}
