You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the SEC before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Directly Related to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on our business and could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since that time, the widespread and sustained transmission of the virus has reached global pandemic status. In response to the pandemic, many national and international health agencies have recommended, and many countries and state, provincial and local governments have implemented, various measures, including travel bans and restrictions, limitations on public and private gatherings, business closures or operating restrictions, social distancing, and shelter-in-place orders.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our 2020 results, resulting in decreased revenues, negatively impacting our global supply chain and resulting in softer product demand due to the effects of the pandemic. Although we saw improvement during 2020 in our results, due to the ongoing uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, there can be no guarantee that this trend will continue, and the COVID-19 pandemic could have a significant negative impact on our results in 2021 and beyond. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 virus and the worldwide response related thereto, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Although the reported cases of COVID-19 have decreased in certain regions of the world, they have continued to increase in others, including the United States and other regions in which we operate, and it is uncertain when the pandemic or its effects will subside. The impact of a continued COVID-19 outbreak or sustained measures taken to limit or contain the outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2021 and beyond.\nOur suppliers and contract manufacturers could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis as a result of disruption to the global supply chain due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If such failures occur, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. Because of the cost and delays that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the\nproducts or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: (i) the duration of the pandemic, including the ability of governments and health care providers to timely distribute available vaccines and the efficacy of such vaccines ; (ii) governmental, business and other actions (which could include limitations on our operations or mandates to provide products or services) taken to limit the reach of the virus and the impact of the pandemic; (iii) the impact on our supply chain; (iv) the impact on our contracts with customers and suppliers, including potential disputes over whether COVID-19 constitutes a force majeure event; (v) our eligibility for and receipt of government assistance and tax benefits offered through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) and any other legislation enacted by the U.S. or other countries in which we operate to mitigate the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; (vi) the impact of the pandemic on worldwide economic activity; (vii) the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet the staffing needs of our critical functions, particularly if members of our work force are quarantined as a result of exposure or unable to work remotely in areas subject to shelter-in-place orders; (viii) any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets that could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and (ix) the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our team members and business partners, among others.\nOn-going shelter-in-place orders could adversely impact our supply chains, operations and workforce, and remote working conditions could increase our susceptibility to a data breach.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many foreign, local and state governments have instituted emergency restrictions that have substantially limited the operation of non-essential businesses and the activities of individuals. Although some local and state governments have begun to lift these restrictions, it is uncertain whether such measures will be successful, and to date, many governments reinstituted previously lifted restrictions due to a subsequent increase in COVID-19 cases. As a result of these restrictive measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19, the majority of our workforce is working remotely from their homes. Remote working conditions may negatively affect our workforce\u2019s productivity, result in disruptions to workflow and operations or make it more difficult for us to maintain proper internal controls over our financial reporting. Further, while we have taken steps to ensure the security of our data and to prevent security breaches, including through the use of authentications and VPNs, many of these measures have been deployed for the first time on a widespread and sustained basis, and there is no guarantee the data security and privacy safeguards we have put in place will be completely effective or that we will not encounter some of the common risks associated with employees accessing Company data and systems remotely. As a result, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. Further, these ongoing government restrictions have and will continue to have an impact on our global supply chain.\nMany of our customers operate in industries that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the virus\u2019s negative impact on their financial conditions and results of operations could have an adverse impact on our revenue.\nWhile the industry in which we operate has not been directly impacted to the same extent as other industries, many of our customers in our Enterprise FiberLAN\u2122 business operate in industries such as hospitality, education and stadiums/facilities management, each of which has been greatly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the protective measures put in place by the local and state governments of the regions in which they operate, such as shelter-in-place orders, business closures, travel restrictions, operating restrictions and cancellations of large events. The adverse impacts that the virus and the accompanying protective measures have on our customers may influence their ability to purchase our products and solutions, make payments under their contracts with us, or it may lower their demand for our products and solutions as they take measures to cut costs and protect their businesses. As a result, our revenue may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on the health of our employees which could be disruptive to our business and operations and may negatively impact productivity.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the United States and the other regions in which we operate. As of December 31, 2020, there have been more than 82 million positive tests for COVID-19 across the globe, with more than 20 million in the United States. If the virus spreads over a large portion of our workforce, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, if a significant number of our executive officers were to contract COVID-19 simultaneously, it could have an adverse effect on our operations, including increased responsibilities for other executives, disruptions in operations or the inability of our executives to focus on essential Company business.\nIn addition, depending on the extent and duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may be subject to significant increases in healthcare costs if a significant number of our personnel become infected with COVID-19 and require medical treatment. As a result, any significant increases in healthcare costs as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, if any employee, contractor or customer tests positive for COVID-19 as a result of having visited one of our facilities, we could be subject to legal action alleging liability. While many jurisdictions have enacted laws or issued executive orders to protect businesses from claims such as these, there can be no guarantee that every jurisdiction in which we operate will enact such protection or that any claim against us will necessarily fall within the scope of that protection.\nRisks Related to our Liquidity\nWe may not have the liquidity to support our future operations and capital requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $45.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $32.2 million in cash balances held by our international subsidiaries. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be unable to adequately fund our existing operations. Our current liquidity condition exposes us to the following risks: (i) vulnerability to adverse economic conditions in our industry or the economy in general; (ii) a substantial portion of available cash is dedicated to debt servicing, rather than other purposes, including operations and new product innovation; (iii) limitations on our ability to adequately plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; and (iv) negative investor and customer perceptions about our financial stability, which could limit our ability to obtain financing or acquire customers.\nOur current liquidity condition could be further harmed, and we may incur significant losses or expend significant amounts of capital if: (i) the market for our products develops more slowly than anticipated or if it retracts; (ii) we fail to establish market share or generate revenue at anticipated levels; (iii) our capital expenditure forecasts change or prove to be inaccurate; or (iv) we fail to respond to unforeseen challenges or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities; or (v) the on-going COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact our business or further exacerbates any of the foregoing risks.\nTo meet our liquidity needs and to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our business, we may be required to raise substantial additional capital, reduce our operations (including through the sale of assets) or both.\nWe have experienced significant losses and we may incur losses in the future. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our profitability, our stock price could decline.\nWe had a net loss of $23.1 million and net income of $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, we have incurred significant losses in prior years. We have an accumulated deficit of $52.3 million as of December 31, 2020. We have significant fixed expenses and expect that we will continue to incur substantial manufacturing, research and product development, sales and marketing, customer support, administrative and other expenses in connection with the ongoing development of our business. In addition, we may be required to spend more on research and product development than originally budgeted to respond to industry trends. We may also incur significant new costs related to acquisitions and the integration of new technologies and other acquisitions that may occur in the future. We may not be able to adequately manage costs and expenses or achieve or maintain adequate operating margins. As a result, our ability to sustain profitability in future periods will depend on our ability to generate and sustain higher revenue while maintaining reasonable costs and expense levels. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability in future periods, we may continue to incur operating losses, which could be substantial, and our stock price could decline.\nIn connection with the Keymile Acquisition, we assumed certain of Keymile\u2019s liabilities, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nPursuant to the definitive agreement for the Keymile Acquisition, we assumed certain of Keymile\u2019s liabilities, including tax and pension liabilities, and any liabilities that may arise related to breaches of representations and warranties made by Keymile in connection with a prior sale of assets by Keymile that survive through 2022. Although the definitive agreement for the Keymile Acquisition entitles us to indemnification for certain losses incurred related to those assumed liabilities, our right to indemnification from the Keymile sellers is limited by the survival period of the representations and warranties included in the Keymile Acquisition definitive agreement and recovery is limited in amount to the purchase price of Keymile, or EUR 10.3 million (approximately $11.8 million). Additionally, our rights to recovery against such losses is limited under our and third party provided warranty and indemnity liability insurance coverage of up to EUR 35.3 million (approximately $39.6 million). If such claims or losses exceed such amount, or if they are not indemnifiable under the Keymile Acquisition definitive agreement, any such losses could negatively impact our financial situation. In addition, our closing of the Keymile Acquisition could give rise to substantial tax liabilities under German law, which could negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks from Financial Control Weakness\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot provide assurances that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with our audit of the fiscal year 2019 consolidated financial statements, we and our independent registered public accounting firm determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we implemented enhanced procedures and controls to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have completed the execution of our remediation plan as of December 31, 2020, and we have concluded the material weaknesses to be remediated as of December 31, 2020.\nIf additional material weaknesses occur in the future and if we are not able to correct the deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms will be adversely affected. Such a result could negatively impact the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, weaken investor confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nCustomer and Product Risk\nThe long and variable sales cycles for our products could cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe target customers for our products have substantial and complex networks that they traditionally expand in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, our marketing efforts are focused primarily on prospective customers that may purchase our products as part of a large-scale network deployment. Our target customers typically require a lengthy evaluation, testing and product qualification process. Throughout this process, we are often required to spend considerable time and incur significant expenses educating and providing information to prospective customers about the uses and features of our products. Even after a company makes the final decision to purchase our products, it could deploy our products over extended periods of time. The timing of deployment of our products varies widely, and depends on a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 skill sets, geographic density of potential subscribers, the degree of configuration and integration required to deploy our products, and our customers\u2019 ability to finance their purchase of our products as well as their operations. As a result of any of these factors, our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe market we serve is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nCompetition in communications equipment markets is intense. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages. We are aware of many companies in related markets that address particular aspects of the features and functions that our products provide. Currently, our primary competitors in our core business include ADTRAN, Calix, Huawei, Nokia and ZTE, among others. In our FiberLAN business, our competitors include Cisco, Nokia and Tellabs. In our Ethernet switching business, our competitors include Cisco, and Juniper. We also may face competition from other communications equipment companies or other companies that may enter our markets in the future. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products and solutions address, both domestically and internationally. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more customer financing than we can. In particular, we are encountering price-focused competitors from Asia, especially China, which places pressure on us to reduce our prices. If we are forced to reduce prices in order to secure customers, we may be unable to sustain gross margins at desired levels or achieve profitability. Competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that render our products less valuable or obsolete.\nIn our markets, principal competitive factors include: (i) product performance; (ii) interoperability with existing products; (iii) scalability and upgradeability; (iv) conformance to standards; (v) breadth of services; (vi) reliability; (vii) ease of installation and use; (viii) geographic footprints for products; (ix) ability to provide customer financing; (x) pricing; (xi) technical support and customer service; and (xii) brand recognition.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we may have difficulty obtaining or retaining customers, and we could experience price reductions, order cancellations, increased expenses and reduced gross margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers\u2019 changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in end-user requirements, frequent new product introductions and changes in communications offerings from network service provider customers. Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, products that meet changing customer demands and industry standards. We may not have sufficient resources to successfully and accurately anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and technological trends, manage long development cycles or develop, introduce and market new products and enhancements. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to develop new products or enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our new products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our products are complex and are deployed in complex environments, our products may have defects that we discover only after full deployment by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software often contains defects or programming flaws that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. In addition, our products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across complex networks. Because of the nature of these products, they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic, and there is no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects. As a result, our customers may discover errors or defects in our hardware or software, or our products may not operate as expected. If we are unable to cure a product defect, we could experience damage to our reputation, reduced customer satisfaction, loss of existing customers and failure to attract new customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, reduced sales opportunities, loss of revenue and market share, increased service and warranty costs, diversion of development resources, legal actions by our customers, and increased insurance costs. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could also result in damages to our customers, financial or otherwise. Our customers could seek damages for related losses from us, which could seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly. The occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nSales to communications service providers are especially volatile, and weakness in sales orders from this industry could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nSales activity in the service provider industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic and business conditions in the country of operations. Although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years, weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Changes in technology, competition, overcapacity, changes in the service provider market, regulatory developments, adverse economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers, with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results, and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\nWe depend on a limited source of suppliers for several key components. If we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements, which would harm our business.\nWe currently purchase several key components from a limited number of suppliers. If any of our limited source of suppliers become insolvent, cease business or experience capacity constraints, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedules. Our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, be acquired by our competitors, stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices, refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price or be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for\ntheir products from their suppliers. If we do not receive critical components from our limited source of suppliers in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. Any failure to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements could materially adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition and liquidity and could materially damage customer relationships.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various elements of the technology used to develop these products. We cannot assure you that our existing or future third-party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to maintain or obtain any third-party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or at greater cost.\nOur intellectual property rights could prove difficult to protect and enforce.\nWe generally rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secret laws and commercial agreements containing restrictions on disclosure and other appropriate terms to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality, employee, contractor and commercial agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information and use of our intellectual property and technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties, including those affiliated with foreign governments, may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, technology or intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries or jurisdictions where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as extensively as in the United States. We cannot assure you that our pending, or any future, patent applications will be granted, that any existing or future patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any existing or future patents will be enforceable or that infringement by third parties will even be detected. While we are not dependent on any individual patents, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time and effort required to create the innovative products.\nThere are additional risks to our intellectual property as a result of our international business operations.\nWe may face risks to our technology and intellectual property as a result of our conducting strategic business discussions outside of the United States, and particularly in jurisdictions that do not have comparable levels of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and customer information and records. While these risks are common to many companies, conducting business in certain foreign jurisdictions, housing technology, data and intellectual property abroad, or licensing technology to joint ventures with foreign partners may have more significant exposure. For example, we have shared intellectual properties with entities in China, South Korea, India, Thailand, and Vietnam pursuant to confidentiality agreements in connection with discussions on potential strategic collaborations, which may expose us to material risks of theft of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets or other sensitive information. Our technology may be reverse engineered by the parties or other parties, which could result in our patents being infringed or our know-how or trade secrets stolen. The risk can be by direct intrusion wherein technology and intellectual property is stolen or compromised through cyber intrusions or physical theft through corporate espionage, including with the assistance of insiders, or via more indirect routes.\nClaims that our current or future products or components contained in our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others may be costly and time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nThe communications equipment industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights, that may relate to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. From time to time, we receive correspondence from companies claiming that our products are using technology covered by or related to the intellectual property rights of these companies and inviting us to discuss or demanding licensing or royalty arrangements for the use of the technology or seeking payment for damages, injunctive relief and other available legal remedies through litigation. These companies also include third-party non-practicing entities (also known as patent trolls) that focus on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights through litigation or the threat of litigation. These companies typically have little or no product revenues and therefore our patents could provide little or no deterrence against such companies filing patent infringement lawsuits against us. In addition, third parties have initiated and could continue to initiate litigation against our manufacturers, suppliers, distributors or even our customers alleging infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights with respect to existing or future products, or components of our products. For example, proceedings alleging patent infringement are routinely commenced in various jurisdictions against manufacturers and consumers of products in the wireless and broadband communications industry. In some cases, courts have issued rulings adverse to such manufacturers and customers, which can result in monetary damages that we are obligated to indemnify or that may impact the cost and availability of components or sales of our products. Courts may also issue injunctions preventing manufacturers from offering, distributing, using or importing products that include the challenged intellectual property. Adverse rulings or injunctive relief awarded against key suppliers of components for our products could result in delays or stoppages in the shipment of affected components, or require us to recall, modify or redesign our products\ncontaining such components. Regardless of the merit of claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, distributors or customers, intellectual property litigation can be time consuming and costly, and result in the diversion of the attention of technical and management personnel. Any such litigation could force us to stop manufacturing, selling, distributing, exporting, incorporating or using products or components that include the challenged intellectual property, or to recall, modify or redesign such products. In addition, if a party accuses us of infringing upon its proprietary rights, we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in any such litigation, we could be subject to significant liability for damages and loss of our proprietary rights. Any of these events or results could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nDue to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition.\nWe currently have significant operations in India, South Korea, and Vietnam, as well as sales and technical support teams in various locations around the world. We continue to consider opportunities to expand our international operations in the future. The successful management and expansion of our international operations requires significant human effort and the commitment of substantial financial resources. Further, our international operations may be subject to certain risks, disruptions and challenges that could materially harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity, including: (i) unexpected changes in laws, policies and regulatory requirements, including but not limited to regulations related to import-export control; (ii) trade protection measures, tariffs, embargoes and other regulatory requirements which could affect our ability to import or export our products into or from various countries; (iii) political unrest or instability, acts of terrorism or war in countries where we or our suppliers or customers have operations, including heightened security concerns stemming from North Korea in relation to our operations in South Korea; (iv) political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns; (v) heightened political tensions between the U.S. and China regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, trade practices and intellectual property rights; (vi) differing technology standards or customer requirements; (vii) developing and customizing our products for foreign countries; (viii) fluctuations in currency exchange rates, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on cash repatriation; (ix) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and financial instability of customers; (x) requirements for additional liquidity to fund our international operations; (xi) pandemics, epidemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (xii) difficulties and excessive costs for staffing and managing foreign operations; (xiii) ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries; (xiv) potentially adverse tax consequences; and (xv) changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, some of our customer purchase agreements are governed by foreign laws and regulations, which may differ significantly from the laws and regulations of the United States. We may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under these agreements and to collect damages, if awarded. Any of these factors could harm our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe conduct significant business in South Korea, Japan, India, Vietnam, Europe, Middle East and Latin America, all of which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nWe have in the past and may in the future undertake a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments, which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAs such, our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nThe telecommunications networking business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the regulatory environment affecting generally accepted accounting principles is uncertain. Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our business.\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current regulatory environment affecting U.S. GAAP is uncertain. Significant changes in U.S. GAAP could affect our financial statements going forward and may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our operating results. U.S. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts, accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles. The cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition.\nChanges in government regulations related to our business could harm our operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including those regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). The FCC has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry in the United States and, as a result, our existing and future products and our customers\u2019 products are subject to FCC rules and regulations. Changes to current FCC rules and regulations and future FCC rules and regulations could negatively affect our business. Non-compliance with the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations would expose us to potential enforcement actions, including monetary forfeitures, and could damage our reputation among potential customers. The uncertainty associated with future FCC decisions may cause network service providers to delay decisions regarding their capital expenditures for equipment for broadband services. In addition, international regulatory bodies establish standards that may govern our products in foreign markets. The SEC has adopted disclosure rules regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals. These rules may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply \u201cconflict free\u201d components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain \u201cconflict free\u201d products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Also, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products. In addition, governments and regulators in many jurisdictions have implemented or are evaluating regulations relating to cyber security, privacy and data protection, which can affect the markets and requirements for networking and communications equipment. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of government regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted in the future, any of which could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business. Because of our smaller size, legislation or governmental regulations can significantly increase our costs and affect our competitive position. Changes to or future domestic and international regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals that could, in the future, be required to operate our business.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and could harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the communications equipment market for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Furthermore, rapid consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of customers we serve. The loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nDNI owns a significant amount of our outstanding common stock and has the ability to exert significant influence or control over any matters that require stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of certain transactions, and DNI\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, DNI owned approximately 43.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, representing a significant amount of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our outstanding common stock at a stockholder meeting. After our sale of shares of common stock in January 2021, DNI owned approximately 37.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. See \u201c-Recent Developments-Equity offering\u201d for more information on the sale of shares of common stock. Due to its significant ownership percentage of our common stock, DNI has the ability to substantially influence or control the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of certain transactions. The interests of DNI may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness and may cause us to take actions that our other stockholders or holders of our indebtedness do not view as beneficial.\nDNI\u2019s large concentration of stock ownership may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire us. Any potential third-party acquirer would most likely need to negotiate any such transaction with DNI, and the interests of DNI with respect to such transaction may be different from the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness.\nAdditionally, two of the Company\u2019s directors serve as executive officers of DNI - Min Woo Nam is the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of DNI and Choon Yul Yoo is the Chief Operating Officer of DNI. Messrs. Nam and Yoo owe fiduciary duties to us and, in addition, have duties to DNI. As a result, these directors may face real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and DNI.\nThere is a limited public market of our common stock.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock. The average daily trading volume in our common stock during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 62,000 shares per day. We cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of shares of our common stock could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares without depressing the market price of our common stock.\nDNI, our largest stockholder, owned approximately 9.5 million shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2020 and has registered those shares with the SEC for resale. After our sale of shares of common stock in January 2021, DNI owned approximately 10.1 million shares of our common stock. See \u201c-Recent Developments-Equity offering\u201d for more information on the sale of shares of common stock. Its shares became eligible for resale without restriction as to volume limitations. Our stock price could suffer a significant decline as a result of any sudden increase in the number of shares sold in the public market or market perception that the increased number of shares available for sale will exceed the demand for our common stock.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will invest future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, holders of our common stock will not receive any return on their investment unless they sell their securities, and holders may be unable to sell their securities on favorable terms or at all.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available.\nIn January 2021, we raised approximately $60.2 million in an equity offering. Refer to Note 17, Subsequent Events, in the consolidated financial statements, for more detail. We need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations and may require additional financing in the future to expand our business, acquire assets or repay or refinance our existing debt. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things: (i) maintain existing operations; (ii) pay ordinary expenses; (iii) fund our business expansion or product innovation; (iv) pursue future business opportunities, including acquisitions; (v) respond to unanticipated capital requirements; (vi) repay or refinance our existing debt; (vii) hire, train and retain employees; or (viii) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results. In addition, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions that we have previously taken, and reduce operations in low margin regions, including reductions in headcount, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and our stock price may continue to be volatile.\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues for a particular quarter are difficult to predict. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The primary factors that could affect our results of operations include the following: (i) commercial acceptance of our products and services; (ii) fluctuations in demand for network access products; (iii) fluctuation in gross margin; (iv) our ability to attract and retain qualified and key personnel; (v) the timing and size of orders from customers; (vi) the ability of our customers to finance their purchase of our products as well as their own operations; (vii) new product introductions, enhancements or announcements by our competitors; (viii) our ability to develop, introduce and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner; (ix) changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; (x) the loss of or failure to renew on commercially reasonable terms any third-party licenses necessary for or relating to our products; (xi) the ability of our company and our contract manufacturers to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products; (xii) our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components; (xiii) increases in the prices of the components we purchase, or quality problems associated with these components; (xiv) unanticipated changes in regulatory requirements which may require us to redesign portions of our products; (xv) changes in accounting rules; (xvi) integrating and operating any acquired businesses; (xvii) our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions; (xviii) how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans; (xix) general economic conditions as\nwell as those specific to the communications, internet and related industries; and (xx) the economic uncertainty created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including its potentially adverse impact on all the foregoing factors.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity that could adversely affect our stock price. Further, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe disruption and volatility in the financial markets. We anticipate that our stock price and trading volume may continue to be volatile in the future, whether due to the factors described above, volatility in public stock markets generally (particularly in the technology sector) or otherwise.\nStrategic acquisitions or investments that we have made or that we could pursue or make in the future may disrupt our operations and harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made investments in and acquired other companies, including Optelian and RIFT in 2021 and Keymile in 2019, that we believe are complementary to our core business. In the future we may continue to make investments in or acquire other companies or complementary solutions or technologies. Any such acquisition or investment may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not the transactions are completed, and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. These transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt or assumption of liabilities, and increase our risk of litigation exposure, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if the resulting business from such a transaction fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial condition may suffer or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.\nAdditionally, any significant acquisition would require the consent of our lenders. Any failure to receive such consent could delay or prohibit us from acquiring companies that we believe could enhance our business. Furthermore, we may dedicate significant time and capital resources in the pursuit of acquisition opportunities and may be unable to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or business opportunities or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular strategic partner.\nUpon the closing of any acquisition transaction, we will need to integrate the acquired organization and its products and services with our legacy operations. The integration process may be expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees, customers, distributors and suppliers, and ultimately may not be successful. The benefits or synergies we may expect from the acquisition of complementary or supplementary businesses may not be realized to the extent or in the time frame we initially anticipated. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently subject to increased risk and to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Any failure to successfully acquire and integrate acquired organizations and their products and services could seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nSome of the risks that could affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, including Optelian and DZS GmbH\u2019s telecommunication systems business, include those associated with: (i) failure to successfully further develop the acquired products or technology; (ii) insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; (iii) conforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, policies, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; (iv) difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; (v) difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; (vi) coordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies; (vii) potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after the announcement of acquisition plans or transactions; (viii) hiring and training additional management and other critical personnel; (ix) in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; (x) increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; (xi) diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions; (xii) consolidation of facilities, integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource and other administrative functions and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions; (xiii) the geographic distance between the companies; (xiv) failure to comply with covenants related to the acquired business; (xv) unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed liabilities for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, employment claims, pension liabilities, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; (xvi) litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims for terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; and (xvii) the disruption, economic and otherwise, created by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, including its potentially compounding effect on all the foregoing factors.\nIf demand for our products and solutions does not develop as we anticipate, then our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity will be adversely affected.\nOur future revenue depends significantly on our ability to successfully develop, enhance and market our products and solutions to our target markets. Most network service providers have made substantial investments in their current infrastructure, and they may elect to remain with their current architectures or to adopt new architectures in limited stages or over extended periods of time. A decision by a customer to purchase our products will involve a significant capital investment. We must convince our service provider customers that they will achieve substantial benefits by deploying our products for future upgrades or expansions. We may experience difficulties with product reliability, partnering, and sales and marketing efforts that could adversely affect our business and divert management attention and resources from our core business. We do not know whether a viable market for our products and solutions will develop or be sustainable in our businesses. If these markets do not develop or develop more slowly than we expect, including as a result of conditions created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity will be materially harmed.\nIncreased tariffs on products and goods that we purchase from off-shore sources (particularly Chinese sources) and changes in international trade policies and relations could have an adverse effect on our customers and operating results.\nThe pricing of our products to customers and our ability to conduct business with certain customers can be affected by changes in U.S. and other countries\u2019 trade policies. For example, before the trade deal was signed between the U.S. and China on January 15, 2020, the United States had imposed tariffs on a wide-range of products and goods manufactured in China that are directly or indirectly imported into the United States. In response, various countries and economic regions announced plans or intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide-range of products they import from the United States. Any newly imposed, announced and threatened U.S. tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could have the effect of increasing the cost of materials we use to manufacture certain products, which could result in lower margins. The tariffs could also result in disruptions to our supply chain, as suppliers struggle to fill orders from companies trying to purchase goods in bulk ahead of announced tariffs. Although we believe that the incremental costs to us of these tariffs were immaterial, if new tariffs are imposed or if new tariffs apply to additional categories of components used in our manufacturing activities, and if we are unable to pass on the costs of tariffs to our customers, our operating results would be harmed.\nGovernmental policy changes regarding tariffs could shift under the new United States presidential administration. The administration has signaled that it will take a measured approach, considering all factors, and considering all options. As a result, no clear indication has yet been provided by the administration with regards to tariffs on Chinese and other imports. For its part, China has called for a reset in relations between the United States and China, though no clear policy proposals have yet been provided. Changes in political environments, governmental policies, international trade policies and relations, including as a result of tensions between the United States and China regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, trade practices and the protection of intellectual property rights, could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, trade sanctions, or retaliatory actions by China in response to U.S. actions, which could have an adverse effect on our customers, business plans and operating results.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for a portion of our manufacturing requirements.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to perform a portion of the manufacturing operations for our products. These contract manufacturers build products for other companies, including our competitors. In addition, we do not have contracts in place with some of these providers and may not be able to effectively manage those relationships. We cannot be certain that our contract manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. We face a number of risks associated with this dependence on contract manufacturers including reduced control over delivery schedules, the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand, poor manufacturing yields and high costs, quality assurance, increases in prices, and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, problems with our contract manufacturers, such as inferior quality, insufficient quantities and late delivery of products.\nA shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly could result in excess or obsolete component inventories that could adversely affect our gross margins.\nOccasionally, we may experience a supply shortage, or a delay in receiving, certain component parts as a result of strong demand for the component parts and/or capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. Conversely, we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price, our gross margins could decrease. In the past we experienced component shortages that adversely affected our financial results and, in the future, may continue to experience component shortages.\nThe loss of a key customer or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue is dependent on several key customers. A loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers, or a dispute or litigation with one of these key customers could affect adversely our revenue and results of operations. A significant deterioration in the financial condition or bankruptcy filing of a key customer could affect adversely the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of accounts receivable from its key customers. As of December 31, 2020, two customers represented 17% and 16% of net accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has an allowance for doubtful account of $3.1 million related to one customer. If one or more of the Company\u2019s top customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the products and services provided by the Company, including as a result of conditions created by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the Company may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable or incur other impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant turnover with respect to our executives and our board, and our business could be adversely affected by these and other transitions in our senior management team or if any future vacancies cannot be filled with qualified replacements in a timely manner.\nWe have experienced significant turnover on our executive team and board since 2018. As a result of this turnover, our remaining management team has been required to take on increased responsibilities, which could divert attention from key business areas. If we continue to experience similar turnover in the future, we may be unable to timely replace the talent and skills of our management team and directors.\nManagement transitions are often difficult and inherently cause some loss of institutional knowledge, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to execute our business strategies may be adversely affected by the uncertainty associated with these transitions and the time and attention from the board and management needed to fill any future vacant roles could disrupt our business. If we are unable to successfully identify and attract adequate replacements for future vacancies in our management roles in a timely manner, we could experience increased employee turnover and harm to our business, growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We face significant competition for executives with the qualifications and experience we seek.\nFurther, we cannot guarantee that we will not face similar turnover in the future. Our senior management\u2019s knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace, and any further turnover could negatively affect our business, growth, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nDecreased effectiveness of share-based compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\nWe have historically used equity incentives, including stock options, as a key component of our employee compensation program in order to align the interests of our employees with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages. If the trading price of our common stock declines, this would reduce the value of our share-based compensation to our present employees and could adversely affect our ability to retain existing or attract prospective employees. Difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could also make it harder or more expensive for us to grant share-based payments to employees in the future.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel, and any failure to do so could harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer and other key employees, and our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to build and operate our business. As discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors, we have experienced significant turnover on our executive team and board since 2018, including the departures of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or executive officers could delay the development and production of our products and negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Moreover, our historical inability to attract and retain sufficient qualified accounting personnel with expertise in U.S. GAAP has adversely affected our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and our ability to produce reliable financial reports, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, increasing legal requirements.\nWe collect, process, store, use, and transmit personal data on a daily basis. Personal data is increasingly subject to legal and regulatory protections around the world, which vary widely in approach and which possibly conflict with one another. In recent\nyears, for example, U.S. legislators and regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, as well as U.S. states have increased their focus on protecting personal data by law and regulation and have increased enforcement actions for violations of privacy and data protection requirements. The State of California recently adopted the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The European Commission also approved and adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a data protection law, which became effective in May 2018. These data protection laws and regulations are intended to protect the privacy and security of personal data that is collected, processed, and transmitted in or from the relevant jurisdiction. Both the CCPA and the GDPR established new requirements applicable to the processing of personal data, afford new data protection rights to individuals and impose significant penalties for data breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under the GDPR for financial or non-financial losses. In July 2020, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework which allowed U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU was invalidated as a GDPR compliance mechanism by the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). These developments create some uncertainty. Ensuring compliance with these laws is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, which could otherwise adversely affect our business operations and negatively impact our financial position or cash flows. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations could also result in regulatory enforcement actions against us, subject us to negative publicity and significant penalties and ultimately cause an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems to provide products and services, maintain financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. If we experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, our information technology systems could be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Furthermore, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to the company or our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial, legal or reputational damage to the Company. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a large portion of our workforce is working remotely, and such remote working could exacerbate any of the foregoing risks.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, the suspension of production or prohibitions on the sale of our products. In addition, such regulations could require us to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the redesign of any non-compliant product. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced and the impact that they could have on our operations or results. For example, in 2003 the European Union enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, for implementation in European Union member states. We are aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or has been considered in the U. S., as well as other countries, such as Japan and China. Implementation of and compliance with these laws may be costly or could otherwise adversely affect our business operations, which could negatively impact our financial position or cash flows. Our failure to comply with any such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in us being liable for costs, fines, penalties or third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries or jurisdictions where such regulations apply.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties.\nFailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties. A significant portion of our revenues is generated from sales outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur business and future operating results are subject to global economic and market conditions.\nMarket turbulence and weak economic conditions, including those caused by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, as well as concerns about energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment could impact our business in a number of ways, including:\nPotential deferment of purchases and orders by customers: Uncertainty about global economic conditions could cause consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to flat revenue budgets, tighter credit, decreased cash availability and weak consumer confidence. Accordingly, future demand for our products could differ materially from our current expectations.\nCustomers\u2019 inability to obtain financing to make purchases and/or maintain their business: Some of our customers require substantial financing in order to finance their business operations, including capital expenditures on new equipment and equipment upgrades, and make purchases from us. The potential inability of these customers to access the capital needed to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves, including factoring credit arrangements to financial institutions, it is possible that we may have to defer revenue until cash is collected or write-down or write-off uncollectible accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If our customers become insolvent due to market and economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on third-party dealers, distributors and retailers: We make sales in certain regions through third-party dealers, distributors and retailers. These third parties may be impacted, among other things, by a significant decrease in available credit. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition end customers to purchase our products from other third parties, or from us directly, it could adversely impact our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on key suppliers: Our ability to meet customers\u2019 demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from our suppliers. Certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, credit constraints of key suppliers could result in accelerated payment of accounts payable by us, impacting our cash flow.\nWe may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity as a result of weak or recessionary economic or market conditions in the United States, South Korea, Germany, or the rest of the world.\nNatural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could materially impact our supply chain and the operations of our customers and suppliers.\nOur global headquarters are located in Plano, Texas and subject to disruption from natural causes beyond our control, including physical risks from tornados, severe storms, floods, other natural disaster or power shortages or outages that could disrupt operations or impair critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, harming our operating results. In addition, in the event any of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to the extent not already occurring, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. Disasters occurring at our or our vendors\u2019 facilities also could impact our reputation.\nAny of the foregoing events may have the effect of disrupting our supply chain, which could harm our business, financial condition results of operations. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs.\nFuture issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing stockholders\u2019 equity ownership.\nWe may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities (see \u201c-Recent Developments-Equity offering\u201d for details on the sale of shares of our common stock in January of 2021) to raise additional capital, to support growth, or, as we have in recent years, to make acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options, grant restricted stock awards or other equity awards to retain, compensate and/or motivate our employees and directors. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89925, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "DZSI"}
