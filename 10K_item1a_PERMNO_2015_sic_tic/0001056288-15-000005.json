{"cik": "1056288", "company": "FEDERATED INVESTORS INC /PA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAs an investment manager, risk is an inherent part of Federated's business. U.S. and global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks involved in Federated's business. Additional risks not presently known to Federated or that Federated currently considers to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Material Concentration in Revenue. For 2014, approximately 32% of Federated\u2019s total revenue was attributable to money market assets as compared to 39% and 47% for 2013 and 2012, respectively. The change in the relative proportion of Federated's revenue attributable to money market assets from 2013 to 2014 was primarily the result of lower average money market assets and increases in fee waivers for certain money market funds to maintain positive or zero net yields. The change in the relative proportion of Federated's revenue attributable to money market assets from 2012 to 2013 was primarily the result of increases in fee waivers for certain money market funds to maintain positive or zero net yields. A significant change in Federated\u2019s investment management business (such as its money market business) or a significant reduction in AUM (such as money market assets) due to regulatory changes, changes in the financial markets, such as significant and rapid increases in interest rates over a short period of time causing certain investors to prefer direct investments in interest-bearing securities, the availability, supply and/or market interest in repurchase agreements and other investments, significant deterioration in investor confidence, further persistent declines in or additional prolonged periods of historically low short-term interest rates and resulting fee waivers, investor preferences for deposit products or other FDIC-insured products or other circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Historically Low Short-Term Interest Rates. For several years, the FOMC has kept the near-zero federal funds rate unchanged and short-term interest rates continued to be at all-time low levels. In certain money market funds, the gross yield earned by the fund is not sufficient to cover all of the fund's operating expenses due to these historically low short-term interest rates. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, Federated has voluntarily waived fees (either through fee waivers or reimbursements or assumptions of expenses) in order for certain money market funds to maintain positive or zero net yields. These fee waivers have been partially offset by related reductions in distribution expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of Federated's mutual understanding and agreement with third-party intermediaries to share the impact of the waivers.\nThese voluntary fee waivers are calculated as a percentage of AUM in certain money market funds and thus will vary depending upon the asset levels in such funds. In addition, the level of waivers are dependent on several other factors including, but not limited to, yields on instruments available for purchase by the money market funds, changes in expenses of the money market funds and changes in the mix of money market assets. In any given period, a combination of these factors drives the amount of fee waivers necessary in order for certain funds to maintain positive or zero net yields. As an isolated variable, an increase in yields on instruments held by the money market funds will cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to decrease. Conversely, as an isolated variable, an increase in expenses of the money market funds would cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to increase.\nWith regard to asset mix, changes in the relative amount of money market fund assets in prime and government money market funds as well as the mix among certain share classes that vary in pricing structure will impact the level of fee waivers. Generally, prime money market funds waive less than government money market funds as a result of higher gross yields on the underlying investments. As such, as an isolated variable, an increase in the relative proportion of average managed assets invested in prime money market funds as compared to total average money market fund assets should typically result in lower waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields. Conversely, the opposite would also be true.\nThe impact of such fee waivers on various components of Federated's Consolidated Statements of Income was as follows for the years ended December 31:\nThe negative pre-tax impact of fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields on certain money market funds increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of lower yields on instruments held by the money market funds partially offset by lower average money market assets. During 2013, the negative pre-tax impact of fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields on certain money market funds increased compared to 2012 primarily as a result of lower yields on instruments held by the money market funds. See Note (20) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the quarterly pre-tax impact of these fee waivers.\nBased on recent commentary from the FOMC in a January 28, 2015 press release, (i.e. \"the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate,\") Federated is unable to predict when the FOMC will increase their target for the federal funds rate. As such, fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields on certain money market funds and the related reduction in distribution expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests could continue for the foreseeable future. Assuming asset levels and mix remain constant and based on recent market conditions, fee waivers for the first quarter of 2015 may result in a negative pre-tax impact on income of approximately $28 million, which is slightly less than the impact to each quarter included in 2014 (see Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Business Developments - Historically Low Short-Term Interest Rates for additional information on management's expectations regarding fee waivers and Note (20) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the quarterly impact of these fee waivers). The actual amount of future fee waivers, the resulting negative impact of these waivers and Federated's ability to recover the net pre-tax impact of such waivers (that is, the ability to capture the pre-tax income going forward, not re-capture previously waived amounts) could vary significantly from management's estimates as they are contingent on a number of variables including, but not limited to, changes in assets within the money market funds, yields on instruments available for purchase by the money market funds, actions by the Governors, the FOMC, the Treasury Department, the SEC, FSOC and other governmental entities, changes in fees and expenses of the money market funds, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in money market product structures and offerings, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with third parties, Federated's willingness to continue the fee waivers and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by any one or more third parties. The continuation, duration, level and impact of these fee waivers, as well as Federated's ability to recover the net pre-tax impact of such waivers (that is, the ability to capture the pre-tax income going forward, not re-capture previously waived amounts) when money market yields increase to the point of eliminating the waivers, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Rising Interest Rates. Despite the expectation that increases in short-term interest rates above the historically low rates of 0% - 0.25% will reduce the impact of fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields, increases in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on Federated\u2019s revenue from money market and other fixed-income products and strategies. In a rising short-term interest rate environment, certain investors using money market products and strategies and other short-term duration fixed-income products and strategies for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other products or strategies holding lower-yielding instruments. In addition, rising interest rates will tend to reduce the fair value of securities held in various investment products and strategies. Among other potential adverse effects, rising interest rates may result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility in financial markets and could negatively impact the performance of Federated's products and strategies and Federated's revenue. Management cannot estimate the impact of rising interest rates (including, for example on Federated's revenue), but such impact could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Decline or Disruption in the Economy or Financial Markets. Economic or financial market downturns or other conditions (domestic or international) may cause volatility, illiquidity and other potential adverse effects in the financial markets and adversely affect the supply of investments, such as money market securities and the profitability and performance of, demand for and investor confidence in Federated\u2019s investment products and strategies, disruptions in the securities and credit markets, the commencement, continuation or ending of government policies and reforms, stimulus programs and other market-related actions, changes in monetary policy, increased regulation, increases or decreases in interest rates, changes in oil prices, changes in currency exchange rates, inflation or deflation, widening bid/ask spreads, restructuring of government-sponsored entities, imposition of economic sanctions, economic or political instability in certain countries or regions, technology-related or cyber-attacks or incidents, terrorism or other factors or events that affect the financial markets may cause or contribute to these potentially adverse effects. In addition, Federated's products and strategies may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. markets, downgrades of U.S. credit ratings, the U.S. debt ceiling or other developments in the U.S. as well as be adversely affected by potential deterioration in international sovereign or currency market conditions.\nAt December 31, 2014, Federated's liquid assets of $318.7 million included investments in certain Federated-sponsored money market and fluctuating-value funds that may have direct and/or indirect exposures to international sovereign debt and currency risks. Federated and the money market and fluctuating net asset value (NAV) funds managed or distributed by Federated also interact with various other financial industry participants, such as counterparties, broker-dealers, banks, clearing organizations, other investment products and customers, as a result of operations, trading, distribution and other relationships. As a result, Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be adversely affected by the creditworthiness or financial soundness of other financial industry participants, particularly in times of economic or financial stress or disruption. There can be no assurance that potential losses that may be realized as a result of these exposures will not have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe ability of Federated to compete and sustain asset and revenue growth is dependent, in part, on the relative attractiveness of the types of investment products and strategies Federated offers and its investment performance under prevailing market conditions. Adverse market conditions or other events also could impact Federated's customers. In the event of extreme circumstances, such as economic, political, or business crises, Federated\u2019s products and strategies may suffer significant net redemptions in AUM causing severe liquidity issues in its short-term sponsored investment products and strategies and declines in the value of and returns on AUM, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCustody and portfolio accounting services for all of Federated's mutual fund products are outsourced to one of three third-party financial institutions that are leading providers of such mutual fund services. Accounting records for Federated's mutual funds are maintained by these service providers. These service providers, or other service providers and/or vendors of Federated, could also be adversely affected by the adverse market conditions described above. It is not possible to predict with certainty the extent to which the services or products Federated receives from such service providers would be interrupted or affected by such situations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that potential service interruption or Federated\u2019s ability to find a suitable replacement would not have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Laws and Regulations on Federated\u2019s Investment Management Business. Federated and its investment management business are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Federated and its products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies are subject to federal securities laws, principally the 1933 Act, 1934 Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, state laws regarding securities fraud and regulations promulgated by various regulatory authorities, including, but not limited to, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). From time to time, the federal securities laws have been augmented substantially. For example, among other measures, Federated and its products and strategies have been impacted by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Patriot Act of 2001, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Federated and its domestic products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies, and any offshore products (such as offshore Federated Funds) and strategies to the extent offered in the U.S., continue to be primarily regulated by the SEC. Federated, and certain Federated Funds, are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA), including due to certain Federated Funds investing in futures, swaps or certain other commodity interests in more than de minimis amounts. In addition, during the past few years regulators such as the SEC, FINRA, CFTC and NYSE have adopted other regulations and amendments that have increased Federated's operating expenses and affected the conduct of its business, and may continue to do so. Federated and its products and strategies also are affected by certain regulations governing banks and other financial institutions. Federated's and its products' operations outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign laws and regulation by foreign regulatory authorities, such as the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for London-based operations, the Central Bank of Ireland for Dublin-based operations, and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority for Frankfurt-based operations. Additional, or changes in, laws, regulations, interpretations or governmental policies, both domestically and abroad, may increase compliance risk and operating expenses, including the costs associated with compliance, and could materially and adversely affect Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. As Federated's business expands, the potential impact of such changes in laws, regulations, interpretations or governmental policies, compliance and the risks and costs associated with compliance may increase.\nDomestically, in addition to other potential future regulation, in 2014, the SEC adopted additional money market fund reforms in the form of the 2014 Rules, and the Treasury Department and IRS issued new regulations and guidance on certain related tax matters (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information on the 2014 Rules and related tax guidance). Management believes that these regulatory developments, including the floating NAV for institutional and municipal money market funds, will be detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Among other potential impacts, these new reforms could increase compliance risks and the costs associated with compliance, make certain money market fund products less attractive to institutional and other investors and result in reductions in assets under management and revenues, and increase operational costs. Given the recent adoption of the SEC\u2019s 2014 Rules, their extended compliance dates, the recent issuance of Treasury Department and IRS guidance on certain related tax matters and the potential for future additional regulation, Federated is unable at this time to assess the degree of impact the SEC's 2014 Rules or potential future regulation may have on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new systemic risk regulation regime under which it is possible that Federated, and/or any one or more of its products (such as the Federated Funds), could be subject to designation as a systemically important financial institution by FSOC, thereby resulting in additional regulation by the Governors in addition to primary regulation by the SEC (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the potential for heightened regulation by the Governors and FSOC). Among other potential impacts, any such designation would subject the designated entity to enhanced banking-oriented measures, including, for example, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, thereby increasing compliance risk and compliance costs. Federated is unable to assess whether, or the degree to which, any of the Federated Funds, including money market funds or any of its other products, could ultimately be designated a systemically important nonbank financial company by FSOC. In management's view, the issuance of final regulations is, and any reforms ultimately put into effect would be, detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated is unable to assess the degree of any potential impact that any reforms or other actions by the Governors, FSOC, or other governmental entities may have on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOutside of the U.S., international regulators, such as the FCA, also have adopted and proposed regulations that could increase Federated's operating expenses and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operation, financial condition and/or cash flows. In addition to other potential future regulation, European money market reform and the imposition of the FTT, particularly if enacted with broad application, would each be detrimental to Federated's fund business (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding European money market reform and the FTT). Among other potential impacts, compliance risks, the cost of compliance and other operational expenses could increase, and certain money market fund products may become less attractive to institutional or other investors, which could result in reductions in assets under management, revenues and operating income. These affects could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated is unable to assess the degree of any potential impact that European money market reform proposals or the FTT may have on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows until such proposals are finalized and approved or the FTT is enacted.\nThe designation as a systemically important non-bank, non-insurance company by the FSB also could have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding systemically important non-bank, non-insurance company designation). Among other potential impacts, any such designation would subject the designated entity to enhanced banking-oriented measures, including, for example, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, thereby increasing compliance risk and compliance costs. Federated is unable to assess whether, or the degree to which, Federated, any of its investment management subsidiaries or any of the Federated Funds, including money market funds, or any of its other products, could ultimately be determined to be a systemically important non-bank, non-insurance company financial institution.\nChanges in laws, regulations, interpretations or governmental policies, domestically and abroad, also impact the financial intermediaries, service providers, customers and other third-parties with whom Federated, and its products (such as the Federated Funds), conduct business. For example, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may affect intermediaries in their sale or use of Federated's products or strategies. Among other potential impacts, this could affect Federated's arrangements with these intermediaries, increase respective operating expenses and distribution costs, result in fewer assets under management and otherwise affect the conduct of their respective businesses. This also could result in Federated or one or more of these third parties seeking to restructure or alter the payment or other terms of the business arrangements between Federated or its products (including the Federated Funds) and one or more of these third parties. The above factors could have a material adverse impact on Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOver the past few years, various service industries, including, for example, mutual fund service providers, have been the subject of changes in tax policy that impact their state and local tax liability. Changes that have been adopted or proposed include (1) an expansion of the nature of a service company's activities that subject it to tax in a jurisdiction, (2) a change in the methodology by which multi-state companies apportion their income between jurisdictions, and (3) a requirement that affiliated companies calculate their state tax as one combined entity. As adopted changes become effective and additional jurisdictions effect similar changes, among other potential impacts, there could be a material adverse effect on Federated's tax liability and effective tax rate and, as a result, net income. Various investment products, such as municipal and tax-free Federated Funds, also may be impacted by tax changes, which could have an adverse effect on the products and Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effect of Providing Financial Support to Investment Products. Federated may, at its sole discretion, from time to time elect to provide financial support to its sponsored investment products (such as the Federated Funds). Providing such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisk of Federated\u2019s Money Market Products\u2019 Ability to Maintain a Stable $1.00 Net Asset Value. Approximately 32% of Federated\u2019s total revenue for 2014 was attributable to money market assets. An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed by the FDIC. Until any changes resulting from the SEC\u2019s 2014 Final Rules (discussed above) are implemented, Federated\u2019s money market funds will seek to maintain a stable NAV. Although stable-value money market funds seek to preserve an NAV of $1.00 per share, it is possible for an investor to lose money by investing in these funds. Federated devotes substantial resources, such as significant credit analysis to the management of its products and strategies. Federated money market funds have always maintained a $1.00 NAV; however, there is no guarantee that such results will be achieved in the future. Market conditions could lead to a limited supply of money market fund securities and severe liquidity issues and/or further persistent declines in or additional prolonged periods of historically low yields in money market products or strategies which could impact their NAVs and performance. If the NAV of a Federated stable-value money market fund were to decline to less than $1.00 per share, such Federated money market fund would likely experience significant redemptions, resulting in reductions in AUM, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nNo Assurance of Access to Sufficient Liquidity. From time to time, Federated\u2019s operations may require more cash than is available from operations. In these circumstances, it may be necessary to borrow from lending facilities or to raise capital by securing new debt or by selling shares of Federated equity or debt securities. Federated\u2019s ability to raise additional capital in the future will be affected by several factors including, for example, Federated\u2019s creditworthiness and the fair value of Federated\u2019s common stock, as well as general market conditions. There can be no assurance that Federated will be able to obtain these funds and financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if Federated cannot obtain such funds, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRetaining and Recruiting Key Personnel. Federated\u2019s ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to its growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining customers. The market for qualified executives, investment managers, analysts, traders, sales representatives and other key personnel is extremely competitive. There can be no assurance that Federated will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel. Federated has encouraged the continued retention of its executives and other key personnel through measures such as providing competitive compensation arrangements and, in certain cases, employment agreements. The loss of any such personnel could have an adverse effect on Federated. In certain circumstances, the departure of key employees could cause higher redemption rates for certain AUM or the loss of customer accounts. Moreover, since certain of Federated\u2019s products and strategies contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings, the loss of even a small number of key personnel associated with these products or strategies could have a disproportionate impact on Federated\u2019s business.\nVarious executives, investment, sales and other key personnel own restricted stock subject to vesting periods of up to ten years from the date awarded and to provisions that require resale or forfeiture to Federated in certain circumstances upon termination of employment. In addition, certain of these employees are employed under contracts which require periodic review of compensation and contain restrictive covenants with regard to divulging confidential information and engaging in competitive activities.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Increased Competition in the Investment Management Business. The investment management business is highly competitive. Federated competes in the management and distribution of investment products and strategies (such as mutual funds and Separate Accounts) with other fund management companies and investment advisers, national and regional broker/dealers, commercial banks, insurance companies and other institutions. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than Federated. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, quality of service, the strength and continuity of management and selling relationships, distribution services offered, the type (passive versus actively managed) and range of products and strategies offered and fees charged. As with any highly competitive market, competitive pricing structures are important. If competitors charge lower fees for similar products or strategies, Federated may decide to reduce the fees on its own products or strategies (either directly on a gross basis or on a net basis through fee waivers) in order to retain or attract customers. Such fee reductions could have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nMany of Federated\u2019s products and strategies are designed for use by institutions such as banks, insurance companies and other corporations. A large portion of Federated\u2019s managed assets, particularly money market and fixed-income assets, are held by institutional investors. If the structure of institutional investment products, such as money market funds, changes or becomes disfavored by institutions, whether due to regulatory or market changes or otherwise, Federated may be unable to retain or grow its share of this market and this could adversely affect Federated\u2019s future profitability and have a material adverse affect on Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nA significant portion of Federated\u2019s revenue is derived from providing products (such as mutual funds) and strategies to the wealth management and trust market, comprising approximately 2,300 banks and other financial institutions. Future profitability of Federated will be adversely affected if it is unable to retain or grow its share of this market, and could also be adversely affected by consolidations in the banking industry, as well as regulatory changes impacting its customers.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Federated\u2019s Distribution Channels. Federated acts as a wholesaler of investment products and strategies to financial intermediaries including, for example, banks, broker/dealers, registered investment advisers and other financial planners. Federated also sells investment products and strategies directly to corporations and institutions. There can be no assurance that Federated will continue to have access to any financial intermediary or financial intermediaries that currently distribute Federated products and strategies or that Federated\u2019s relationship with any one or more financial intermediaries will continue over time or on existing economic terms. The impact of minimum yield waivers and related reductions in distribution expense can vary depending upon, among other variables, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with one or more financial intermediaries and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by one or more financial intermediaries. In addition, exclusive of the impacts of minimum yield waivers and related reductions in distribution expense to maintain positive or zero net yields, Federated has experienced increases in the cost of distribution as a percentage of total revenue from 31% in 2007 to over 38% in 2014. Federated expects such costs to continue to increase in total due to asset growth and per dollar of revenue due to the competitive pressures of the investment management business. Higher distribution costs reduce Federated\u2019s operating and net income.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Declines in the Amount of or Changes in the Mix of Assets Under Management. A significant portion of Federated\u2019s revenue is derived from investment advisory fees, which are based on the value of managed assets and vary with the type of asset being managed, with higher fees generally earned on equity products and strategies than on fixed-income and money market products and strategies. Likewise, mutual fund and other fund products generally have a higher management-fee rate than Separate Accounts or a liquidation portfolio. Additionally, certain components of distribution expense can vary depending upon the asset class, distribution channel and/or the size of the customer relationship. Consequently, significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by, or the level of redemptions from, the products (such as the Federated Funds) or strategies advised by Federated may materially affect the amount of managed assets and thus Federated\u2019s revenue, profitability and growth. Similarly, changes in Federated\u2019s average asset mix across both asset and product or strategy types have a direct impact on Federated\u2019s revenue and profitability. Federated generally pays out a larger portion of the revenue earned from managed assets in money market funds than the revenue earned from managed assets in equity or fixed-income funds. Substantially all of Federated\u2019s managed assets are in investment products or strategies that permit investors to redeem or withdraw their investment at any time. Additionally, changing market conditions may cause a shift in\nFederated\u2019s asset mix towards money market and fixed-income products or strategies which may cause a decline in Federated\u2019s revenue and net income.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Poor Investment Performance. Success in the investment management business is largely dependent on investment performance relative to market conditions and the performance of competing products and strategies. Good performance generally assists retention and growth of managed assets, resulting in additional revenues. Conversely, poor performance tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in revenues to Federated. Poor performance could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The effects of poor performance on Federated could be magnified where assets or customers are concentrated in certain strategies, products, asset classes or sectors. In terms of revenue concentration by product, approximately 11% of Federated\u2019s total revenue for 2014 was derived from services provided to a sponsored fund, the Federated Kaufmann Fund. A significant and prolonged decline in the AUM in this fund could have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s future revenues and, to a lesser extent, net income, due to a related reduction to distribution expenses associated with this fund.\nOperational Risks. Federated's and its products/business operations are supported internally and through management of relationships with various third party service providers, both domestically and internationally. In turn, service providers' operations rely on additional relationships with other third parties. Operational risks include, but are not limited to, improper, inefficient, or unauthorized execution, processing, pricing and/or monitoring of transactions, deficiencies in operating systems, business disruptions, inadequacies or breaches in Federated\u2019s, its products' or a service provider's internal control processes, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and noncompliance with regulatory requirements. As Federated's and it's relevant service provider's businesses expand, operational risk increases both domestically and internationally. Management relies on its employees and systems, and those of relevant service providers, to comply with established procedures, controls and regulatory requirements. Breakdown or improper use of systems, human error or improper action by employees or service providers, or noncompliance with regulatory rules, could cause material adverse effects on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nNo Assurance of Successful Acquisitions. Federated\u2019s business strategy contemplates the acquisition of other investment management companies, as well as investment assets, both domestically and internationally. There can be no assurance that Federated will find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources to realize its acquisition strategy, be successful in entering into definitive agreements for or consummating desired acquisitions, or successfully integrate acquired companies into Federated, or that any such acquisitions, if consummated, will prove to be advantageous to Federated.\nImpairment Risk. At December 31, 2014, Federated had intangible assets including goodwill totaling $733.8 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, the vast majority of which represents assets capitalized in connection with Federated\u2019s acquisitions and business combinations. Federated may not realize the value of these assets. Management performs an annual review of the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and periodic reviews of the carrying values of all other assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of an asset to become impaired. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the asset would occur, resulting in a noncash charge which would adversely affect Federated\u2019s financial position and results of operations for the period.\nSystems, Technology and Cybersecurity Risks. Federated utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business (both domestically and internationally) including, for example, both proprietary systems and those provided by outside service providers. Service providers to, and customers of, Federated and its products, and third parties on which such service providers and customers rely, also utilize software and related technologies in their businesses. Unanticipated issues could occur and it is not possible to predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from a failure of Federated or a third party to address computer system problems. Data or model imprecision, software or other technology malfunctions, programming inaccuracies and similar or other circumstances or events may impair the performance of systems and technology. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that potential system interruptions, other technology-related issues or the cost necessary to rectify the problems would not have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, the use of the Internet and other electronic media and technology exposes Federated, its business, its products and services, customers, and relevant service providers, and their respective operations, to potential risks from cybersecurity attacks, events or incidents (cyber incidents). For example, Federated and relevant service providers collect, maintain and transmit confidential, proprietary and personal customer information (such as in connection with online account access and performing investment, reconciliation, transfer agent, custodian and other recordkeeping and related functions) that can be\ntargeted by cyber incidents. Cyber incidents may include, for example, unauthorized access to systems, networks or devices (for example, through hacking activity), infection from computer viruses or other malicious software code, corruption of data, and attacks (including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks on websites) which shut down, disable, slow or otherwise disrupt operations, business processes or website access or functionality. In addition to intentional cyber incidents, unintentional cyber incidents can occur, (for example, the inadvertent release of confidential or non-public personal information). A cyber incident may cause Federated, its business, products or services, its customers, or relevant service providers, to lose proprietary, sensitive, confidential or non-public business or customer information, suffer data corruption or business interruption, lose operational capacity (for example, the loss of the ability to process transactions, calculate NAV, or allow the transaction of business), and/or fail to comply with applicable privacy and other laws. Among other potentially harmful effects, cyber incidents also may result in theft, unauthorized monitoring and failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems. Any cyber incident could cause adverse impacts, the occurrence of financial losses, expenses and exposure related to regulatory penalties, litigation, reputational damage, and additional compliance costs associated with protection, detection, remediation and corrective measures. Cyber incidents affecting issuers in which Federated\u2019s or its customers\u2019 assets are invested also could cause such investments to lose value. Any of these cyber incidents may become incrementally worse if they were to remain undetected for an extended period of time.\nThe operating systems of Federated, its products, its customers and relevant service providers are dependent on the effectiveness of information security policies and procedures which seek to ensure that such systems are protected from cyber incidents. Federated has, and believes its products and its service providers have, established risk management systems that are reasonably designed to seek to reduce the risks associated with cyber incidents, however, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful, either entirely or partially. Among other reasons, the nature of malicious cyber incidents is becoming increasingly sophisticated and Federated, and its relevant affiliates and products, cannot control the systems and cybersecurity systems of issuers, relevant service providers or other third parties. While Federated cannot predict the financial or reputational impact to its business resulting from any cyber incident, the occurrence of a cyber incident, or a similar situation or incident, could have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Reputational Harm. Any material losses in customer (including shareholder) confidence in Federated, its products or strategies or in the mutual fund industry as a result of potential litigation, economic or financial market downturns or disruptions, material errors in public news reports, misconduct, rumors on the Internet or other matters could increase redemptions from and/or reduce sales of Federated's products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies and other investment management products and services. If such losses were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Termination or Failure to Renew Fund Agreements. A substantial majority of Federated\u2019s revenues are derived from investment management agreements with sponsored funds (and to a lesser extent, sub-advised funds) that, as required by law, are terminable upon 60 days notice. In addition, each such investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by each fund\u2019s board of directors or trustees, including independent members of the board, or its shareholders, as required by law. Failure to renew, changes resulting in lower fees, or termination of certain, or a significant number of these agreements could have a material adverse impact on Federated. As required by the 1940 Act, each investment advisory agreement with a mutual fund automatically terminates upon its assignment, although new investment advisory agreements may be approved by the mutual fund\u2019s directors or trustees and shareholders. A sale or other transfer of a sufficient number of shares of Federated\u2019s voting securities to transfer control of Federated could be deemed an assignment in certain circumstances. An assignment, actual or constructive, will trigger these termination provisions and may adversely affect Federated\u2019s ability to realize the value of these agreements. Federated investment advisory contracts for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the 1940 Act generally are terminable by Federated\u2019s customers upon notice to Federated (or, in certain cases, after a 30 day, 60 day or similar notice period). As required by the Advisers Act, investment advisory agreements for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the 1940 Act also provide that consent is required from Federated's customers before the agreements may be assigned and an assignment, actual or constructive, also will trigger these consent requirements and may adversely affect Federated's ability to realize the value of these agreements.\nUnder the terms of a settlement agreement with the SEC and New York State Attorney General, a Federated investment advisory subsidiary may not serve as investment adviser to any registered investment company unless: (1) at least 75% of the fund\u2019s directors are independent of Federated; (2) the chairman of each such fund is independent of Federated; (3) no action may be taken by the fund\u2019s board of directors or trustees or any committee thereof unless approved by a majority of the independent board members of the fund or committee, respectively; and (4) the fund appoints a senior officer who reports to the\nindependent directors or trustees and is responsible for monitoring compliance by the fund with applicable laws and fiduciary duties and for managing the process by which management fees charged to a fund are approved.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Unpredictable Events. Unpredictable events, such as natural disaster, pandemic, war and terrorist attack, could adversely impact Federated\u2019s, its customer's and their respective service providers' ability to conduct business. Such events could cause disruptions in economic conditions and financial markets, system interruption, loss of life, unavailability of personnel or additional costs. As such, there can be no assurance that unpredictable events, or the costs to address such events, would not have a material adverse effect on Federated\u2019s business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Litigation, Investigations, Proceedings and Other Claims. Federated can be subject to routine, sweep and other examinations, inquiries, investigations, proceedings (administrative, regulatory, civil or otherwise) and other claims by its regulators (regulatory claims). Federated also can be subject to customer, and other third-party complaints, proceedings (such as civil litigation) and other claims (business-related claims). Among other factors, as Federated\u2019s business, products and strategies expand, and financial products and other investments, markets and technology increase in complexity, the attention and resources that Federated devotes to compliance increases and the possibility and occurrences of non-compliance may increase. Federated has business-related claims asserted and threatened against it, and is subject to certain regulatory claims (such as routine and sweep examinations and other inquiries), in the ordinary course of business. In addition, Federated may be subject to business-related claims, and administrative, regulatory or civil investigations and proceedings or other regulatory claims, outside of the ordinary course of business. Federated cannot assess or predict whether, when or what types of business-related claims or regulatory claims (collectively, claims) may be threatened or asserted, the types or amounts of damages or other remedies that may be sought (which may be material when threatened or asserted), whether claims that have been threatened will become formal asserted pending investigations, proceedings or litigation, or whether claims ultimately may be successful (whether through settlement or adjudication), entirely or in part, whether or not any such claims are threatened or asserted in or outside the ordinary course of business. Federated may be initially unable to accurately assess a claim's impact. Given that the outcome of any claim is inherently unpredictable and uncertain, a result may arise from time to time that adversely impacts, potentially in a material way, Federated\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In certain circumstances, insurance coverage may not be available or deductible amounts may not be exceeded, and Federated may have to bear the costs related to claims or any losses or other liabilities resulting from any such matters, or from the operation of Federated\u2019s business, products and services generally.\nFederated\u2019s Status as a \"Controlled Company.\" Federated has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock, which has voting power, and Class B Common Stock, which is non-voting except in certain limited circumstances. All of the outstanding shares of Federated's Class A Common Stock are held by the Voting Shares Irrevocable Trust for the benefit of certain members of the family of John F. Donahue. The three trustees of this trust are Mr. John F. Donahue, the Chairman of Federated's board of directors, his wife, and his son, Mr. J. Christopher Donahue, who is Federated's President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director. Accordingly, Federated qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. As a controlled company, Federated qualifies for and relies upon exemptions from several NYSE corporate governance requirements, including requirements that: (1) a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors; and (2) the entity maintains a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities. As a result, Federated's board does not have a majority of independent directors nor does it maintain a nominating/corporate governance committee. Federated is also exempt as a \"controlled company\" from certain additional independence requirements and responsibilities regarding compensation advisers applicable to Compensation Committee members, including those that became effective in 2013.", "PERMNO": 86102, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "FHI"}
