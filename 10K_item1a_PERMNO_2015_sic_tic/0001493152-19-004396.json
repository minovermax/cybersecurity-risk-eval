RISK FACTORS\nOur business and an investment in our common stock are subject to a variety of risks. The following risk factors describe some of the most significant events, facts or circumstances that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to implement our business plan and the market price for our common stock. Many of these events are outside of our control. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Outstanding Indebtedness, Need for Additional Financing and Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant losses, expect to continue to incur losses and may never be profitable.\nWe have a history of operating losses and at December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $215.0 million. Our ability to achieve profitability will be influenced by many factors, including, among others, the level and timing of future revenues and expenditures; development, commercialization and market acceptance of our products; competing technologies and market developments; regulatory requirements and delays; ability to attract and retain key personnel; and pending litigation. As a result, we may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. These losses will continue to have an adverse impact on our stockholders\u2019 equity, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe will need additional financing to satisfy our anticipated future liquidity requirements, which financing may not be available on favorable terms at the time it is needed and which could reduce our operational and strategic flexibility.\nWe have substantial operating expenses associated with the sales and marketing of our products. Although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $6.8 million, as of December 31, 2018, together with existing credit availability and $10.0 million in availability under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility dated March 29, 2019 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through the end of March 2020. Although we recently increased availability under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we still believe we may require additional funds to fund our future operations and business strategy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will not need or seek additional funding. We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if market conditions for raising additional capital are favorable. We may seek to raise additional funds through various sources, such as equity and debt financings, additional debt restructurings or refinancings, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This is particularly true if economic and market conditions deteriorate. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could result in our inability to pay our expenses as they come due, limit our ability to expand our business operations, and harm our overall business prospects. If adequate funds are not otherwise available, we could be required to curtail operations significantly, including reducing our sales and marketing expenses which could negatively impact product sales and we could even be required to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities or the restructuring or refinancing of our debt, the interests of our current stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect the rights of our stockholders or reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Prior to raising additional equity or debt financing, we must obtain the consent of ROS and Royalty Opportunities, the lenders under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and no assurance can be provided that ROS and Royalty Opportunities would provide such consent, which could limit our ability to raise additional financing.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, including, as of December 31, 2018, $77.9 million in aggregate principal plus additional accrued interest outstanding under our credit facility. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, including amounts borrowed under our credit facility, and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures, contractual cash obligations, known and unknown liabilities, research and development efforts, working capital, any future acquisitions and business combinations, and other general corporate purposes depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity dates thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek to raise additional capital, or take other similar actions. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, the consent of our lenders, and other factors, including market conditions. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would likely have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25cf make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u25cf restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions, business combinations or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow additional amounts or raise financing for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, research and development efforts, acquisitions or business combinations, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness, and if we do, the risks related to our business and our ability to service our indebtedness would increase.\nA failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could require the immediate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the credit agreement, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible, or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nThe terms of our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a number of significant financial and operating restrictions. For example, the agreement contains financial covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum liquidity covenant and a minimum revenue base, each as defined in the agreement, and contains provisions that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to, among other things:\n\u25cf make loans and investments, including acquisitions and transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf create liens or other encumbrances on our assets;\n\u25cf dispose of assets;\n\u25cf enter into contingent obligations;\n\u25cf NYSE compliance;\n\u25cf engage in mergers or consolidations; and\n\u25cf pay dividends.\nWe may be unable to comply with these covenants, which could result in a default under the agreement. In addition, these provisions may limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. In addition, they may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer, if any, restrictions or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as significant acquisitions or business combinations, may be subject to the consent of the lenders, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.\nOur Credit Facility involves additional risks that may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAvailability under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is based on the amount of our liquidity, financial performance, and sales results. As a result, our access to credit under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility is subject to fluctuations depending on our financial results and projected cash balances as of any valuation date. Our inability to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility will, after March 31, 2020, bear interest at variable rates, which subjects us to interest rate risk and could increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness. The impact of increases in interest rates could be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our indebtedness, thereby affecting our profitability. In the event of a default under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders may terminate their commitments to lend additional money under the credit facility and declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. While an event of default is continuing under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder may elect to increase the rates at which interest accrues. Subject to certain exceptions, amounts outstanding under the credit facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of our company and each borrower. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the lenders could seek to enforce security interests in our assets securing our indebtedness under the credit facility, including restricting our access to collections on our accounts receivable. Any acceleration of amounts due under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or the exercise by the lenders thereto of their rights under the security documents, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be unable to meet financial or other covenant requirements in our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and we may be unable to successfully negotiate waivers to cure any covenant violations.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, fees, affirmative and negative covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant and a minimum revenue base covenant, and default provisions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under this agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness. Also, should there be an event of default, or should we need to obtain waivers following an event of default, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive covenants in future periods. In addition, to secure the performance of our obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we pledged substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, to the lenders. Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could result in an event of default, the acceleration of our debt and the loss of our assets.\nWe rely on our subsidiaries for funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\nWe conduct substantially all of our activities through our subsidiaries. We depend on those subsidiaries for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our outstanding indebtedness. The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, applicable state corporation or similar statutes and other laws and regulations. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries may be insufficient to enable us to pay the outstanding principal or interest due on our outstanding indebtedness when due.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nMany competitive products exist and more will be developed. Our operating results have suffered due to intense competition and we may not be able to successfully compete because we are smaller and have fewer financial resources.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological change. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products for use by our customers. Many of the companies developing or marketing competitive products enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including greater financial and human resources for product development and sales and marketing; greater name recognition; established relationships with surgeons, hospitals and third-party payors; broader product lines and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and established sales and marketing and distribution networks. Our competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than us, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for competing products more rapidly than us, develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive or acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Not all of our sales and other personnel have non-compete agreements. We also compete with other organizations in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and management personnel. If our competitors are more successful than us in these matters, we may be unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors. Intense competition adversely affected our operating results during 2018. In addition, our industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industry not involving our company could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We may be unable to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products, or our products could become obsolete, and our business and operating results would suffer.\nDue to lack of funding, our research and development efforts have suffered during the past few years. We may be unable to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep up with existing or new products and technologies in the markets in which we compete. If we do not continue to introduce new products and technologies, or if those products and technologies are not accepted, we may not be successful. Moreover, research and development efforts require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material, or innovation. Demand for our products also could change in ways we may not anticipate due to evolving customer needs, changing demographics, slow industry growth rates, declines in our markets, the introduction of new products and technologies, evolving surgical philosophies, and evolving industry standards, among others. Additionally, our competitors\u2019 new products and technologies may beat our products to market, may be more effective or less expensive than our products, or may render our products obsolete. It is also important that we carefully manage our introduction of new and enhanced products and technologies. If potential customers delay purchases until new or enhanced products are available, it could negatively impact our revenue. Our new products and technologies also could reduce demand for or render our existing products obsolete and thus adversely affect sales of our existing products and lead to increased expense for excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe are highly dependent on the availability of human donors; any disruptions could cause our customers to seek alternative providers or technologies.\nWe are highly dependent on our ability to obtain donor cadavers as the raw material for many of our biologics products. The availability of acceptable donors is relatively limited, and we compete with many other companies for this limited availability. The availability of donors is also impacted by regulatory changes, general public opinion of the donor process and our reputation for our handling of the donor process. In addition, due to seasonal changes in the mortality rates, some scarce tissues are at times in short supply. Any disruption in the supply of this crucial raw material could have significant consequences for our revenue, operating results and continued operations.\nOur inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the services of our executives. However, we have experienced a high level of turnover among our executive team over the past year, including the departure of our interim CEO and our CFO during the first quarter of 2019. Most of the members of our management team have joined the Company in the past year. Currently, our Vice President of Finance, Greg Jensen, is serving as our interim Chief Financial Officer and our principal executive officer as we search for qualified replacements. The loss of Mr. Jensen, or the loss of any of the remaining key members of our management team, such as our Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Operations Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our future operations. We do not currently maintain key-person life insurance policies insuring the life of any member of our management team.\nOur future success also depends, in part, upon our ability to retain and motivate key managerial, sales, and technical personnel, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. We compete for such personnel with other companies, academic institutions, governmental entities, and other organizations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future. Any unanticipated loss or interruption of services of our management team and our key personnel could significantly reduce our ability to meet our strategic objectives due to extended time required for us to find appropriate replacement personnel, if at all, should the need arise. Loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued availability of our facilities and would be harmed if they were unavailable for any prolonged period of time.\nAny failure in the physical infrastructure of our facilities or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business reputation and financial results. We are highly reliant on our Belgrade, Montana facilities. Any natural or man-made event that impacts our ability to utilize these facilities could have a significant impact on our operating results, reputation and ability to continue operations. The regulatory process for approval of facilities is time-consuming and our ability to rebuild facilities would take a considerable amount of time and expense and cause a significant disruption in service to our customers. Further, the FDA or some other regulatory agency could identify deficiencies in future inspections of our facilities or our supplies that could disrupt our business and harm our operating results. This is risk is particularly relevant with respect to the Class 2 recall of our Calix Lumbar Spine Implant System initiated in December 2018.\nWe may be subject to product liability litigation that could be expensive, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate in a catastrophic situation.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices and biologics expose us to significant risk of product liability claims. We may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims, including product liability claims arising out of the use of our products. We also could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products. This risk is relevant with respect to our Calix Lumbar Spine Implant System recall initiated in December 2018. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts and product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, significant litigation and other costs, substantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients, product recalls, loss of revenue, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the inability to commercialize new products or product candidates, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. We currently carry product liability insurance; however, our insurance coverage may not be adequate, and our business could suffer material adverse consequences due to product liability claims.\nLitigation may result in financial loss and/or impact our ability to sell our products going forward.\nWe are subject to certain pending litigation and dispute matters. For example, in December 2018, a complaint was filed by RSB Spine, LLC against us which claims that some of our products, including the Irix-ATM Lumbar Integrated Fusion System and the Irix-CTM Cervical Integrated Fusion System, infringe certain of RSB Spine\u2019s patents. The complaint seeks, among other relief, an injunction against future infringement, unspecified damages for infringement, and treble damages for willful infringement. Our pending litigation is discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Although we intend to vigorously defend any existing or future litigation or dispute in which we may be involved, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in these matters. An unfavorable judgment or settlement may result in a financial burden on us. An unfavorable judgment or settlement may also result in restrictions on our ability to sell certain products and therefore may impact future operating results. Moreover, costs, fees, expenses, settlement amounts, judgments or other liabilities associated with such matters may not be covered by our insurance.\nWe have completed acquisitions and business combinations in the past and may complete them in the future. Acquisitions and business combinations are risky and may harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have completed acquisitions and business combinations in the past, including the acquisition of X-spine Systems, Inc. in 2015, and may complete them in the future. Our ability to complete acquisitions and business combinations will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions; our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates; and the availability of capital and personnel to complete such acquisitions and run the acquired business effectively. Any acquisition or business combination could impair our business, financial condition, reputation, and operating results. The benefits of an acquisition or business combination may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that previous or future acquisitions or business combinations will, in fact, produce any benefits. Acquisitions and or business combinations may involve a number of risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, including:\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf disruption to our existing operations and plans;\n\u25cf inability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u25cf difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations, manufacturing processes and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and synergies;\n\u25cf inability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, or sales representatives of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and sales representatives;\n\u25cf violation of confidentiality and non-compete obligations or agreements by employees of an acquired business;\n\u25cf adverse impact on overall profitability if our expanded operations do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;\n\u25cf reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay acquisition purchase prices or other business venture investment costs, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u25cf infringement by acquired businesses or other business ventures of intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs;\n\u25cf incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions and incurrence of non-recurring charges; and\n\u25cf write-off of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets as a result of deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line, adverse market conditions, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in laws or regulations that restrict activities of an acquired business or product line, or as a result of a variety of other circumstances.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a goodwill impairment of $38.3 million as well as an impairment charge of $9.8 million to tradenames, technology, and customer relationships related to the fixation business that we acquired in connection with our 2015 acquisition of X-spine Systems, Inc.\nIn addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses may result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement, and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Also, some acquisitions may require the consent of the lenders under our credit facility. We cannot predict whether such approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which the lenders would approve such acquisitions. These risks, among others, could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or other business combination or multiple transactions within a relatively short period of time.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations, and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf demand for products;\n\u25cf the level of competition;\n\u25cf the number, timing, and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to develop, introduce, and market new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for products;\n\u25cf changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in the treatment practices of our customers;\n\u25cf changes in distributor or independent sales representative relationships and sales force size and composition;\n\u25cf the timing of material expense- or income-generating events and the related recognition of their associated financial impact;\n\u25cf the number and mix of products sold in the quarter and the geographies in which they are sold;\n\u25cf the number of selling days;\n\u25cf the availability and cost of components and materials;\n\u25cf the timing of orders and shipments;\n\u25cf ability to obtain reimbursement for our products and the timing of patients\u2019 use of their calendar year medical insurance deductibles;\n\u25cf work stoppages or strikes in the healthcare industry;\n\u25cf changes in FDA and foreign governmental regulatory policies, requirements, and enforcement practices;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, estimates, and treatments;\n\u25cf restructuring, impairment, and other special charges;\n\u25cf costs associated with our pending litigation;\n\u25cf variations in cost of sales due to the amount and timing of excess and obsolete inventory charges, commodity prices, and manufacturing variances;\n\u25cf income tax fluctuations and changes in tax rules;\n\u25cf general economic factors; and\n\u25cf increases of interest rates, which can increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facility, and generally affect the level of economic activity.\nWe believe our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. We cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period. Any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period.\nA significant portion of our product revenue is made through independent distributors and sales agents who we do not control.\nA significant portion of our product revenue is made through distributors and independent sales agents. Because the independent distributor often controls the customer relationships within its territory (and, in certain countries outside the United States, the regulatory relationship), there is a risk that if our relationship with the distributor ends, our relationship with the customer will be lost (and, in certain countries outside the United States, that we could experience delays in amending or transferring our product registrations). Also, because we do not control the field sales agents of a distributor or independent sales agent, there is a risk we will be unable to ensure that our sales processes, compliance, and other priorities will be consistently communicated and executed by the distributor or sales agent. If we fail to maintain relationships with our key distributors and independent sales representatives or fail to ensure that our distributors and independent sales agent adhere to our sales processes, compliance, and other priorities, this could have an adverse effect on our operations. Changes to or turnover within our independent distributor and independent sales agent organization or transitions to direct selling models also could adversely affect our business if these transitions are not managed effectively. During 2018, we experienced changes to and turnover within our distributor and independent sales organization which had an adverse effect on our business. Further, independent distributors and sales agents of companies we have acquired may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us. A loss of a significant number of our distributors or agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our success is partially dependent upon our ability to retain and motivate our distributors, independent sales agencies, and their representatives to sell our products in certain territories. They may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans. Some of our distributors and independent sales agencies do not sell our products exclusively and may offer similar products from other orthopedic companies. Our distributors and independent sales agencies may terminate their contracts with us, may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products, or may focus their sales efforts on other products that produce greater commissions for them, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and operating results.\nThe recent notification of the termination of a consulting agreement effective on March 22, 2019 will likely adversely affect our operating results beginning with the first quarter of 2019.\nIn December 2018, we received notification of the termination of a consulting agreement with an entity that has close relationships with several of our customers representing approximately 23% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of this notification, this agreement will terminate effective March 22, 2019. We anticipate that the termination of this agreement will negatively impact our revenues based on our ability to continue to sell products through our distribution channels to our customers affiliated with this entity.\nWorldwide economic instability could adversely affect our net sales, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe health of the global economy, and the credit markets and the financial services industry in particular, affects our business and operating results. If the credit markets are not favorable, we may be unable to raise additional financing when needed or on favorable terms. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any economic crisis could also adversely impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with materials and components, either of which may negatively impact our business. As with our customers and vendors, these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Further, there are concerns for the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency, given the economic and political challenges facing individual Eurozone countries and Brexit. Continuing deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Eurozone countries, the withdrawal of one or more member countries from the European Union, or the failure of the Euro as a common European currency could adversely affect our sales, financial condition, or operating results.\nAlthough our international business is not substantial, we do operate in some markets outside the United States that are subject to political, economic, and social instability and expose us to additional risks.\nOperations in countries outside of the United States accounted for approximately 5% of our total revenue for our year ended December 31, 2018. Our operations outside of the United States are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. Our international sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u25cf the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations on orthopedic implants and biologic products;\n\u25cf withdrawal from or revision to international trade policies or agreements and the imposition or increases in import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, import and export quotas and other trade restrictions, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with that country, company, person, or entity;\n\u25cf economic instability, including currency risk between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, in our target markets;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors;\n\u25cf scrutiny of foreign tax authorities, which could result in significant fines, penalties, and additional taxes being imposed upon us;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increases in infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology;\n\u25cf a shortage of high-quality international salespeople and distributors;\n\u25cf loss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge or are otherwise important to our success in international markets;\n\u25cf changes in third-party reimbursement policy that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate our reducing selling prices for our products;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf differing local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions, particularly related to the exportation of our biologic products;\n\u25cf difficulties in protecting, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u25cf national and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes, acts of war or terrorist acts;\n\u25cf complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws; and\n\u25cf exposure to different legal and political standards.\nIn addition, in June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d In March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom formally gave notice of its intent to withdraw from the European Union. Serving this notice began a two-year period for the United Kingdom to negotiate terms for its withdrawal from the European Union and future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on the movement of goods and people between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could affect our ability to sell our products in certain European Union countries. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and Euro. We do not know to what extent these changes will impact our business. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others that we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. In addition, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to continuing membership with the European Union. At this time, it is not certain what steps, may be taken to facilitate the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, which has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have and how such withdrawal could affect, or whether it could have a material adverse effect on, our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe costs of complying with the requirements of the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn May 2018, the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became effective, replacing the current data protection laws of each EU member state. The GDPR implemented more stringent operational requirements for personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by European Data Protection Authorities, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have spent and expect to continue to expend significant time, costs and resources to comply with the GDPR.\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, and failures of, interruptions to, or unauthorized tampering of those systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business. In addition, we have grown in part through strategic business combinations and acquisitions. As a result of these transactions, we may face risks due to implementation, modification, or remediation of the IT controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired businesses. We continue to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate, and we plan to continue system roll-outs in the future and to otherwise upgrade and expand our IT system capabilities. We may experience difficulties in our business operations, or difficulties in operating our business under these systems, either of which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, and otherwise adequately service our customers, and lead to increased costs and other difficulties. In the event we experience significant disruptions as a result of the implementation or upgrade of new systems or otherwise, we may not be able to fix our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate timely, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our customers, suppliers and third-party service providers, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of any underlying information and data. We have programs, processes and technologies in place to prevent, detect, contain, respond to and mitigate security related threats and potential incidents. We undertake considerable ongoing improvements to our IT systems in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect, anticipating, identifying or preventing these intrusions or mitigating them if and when they occur, may be challenging. Our IT systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards. We also outsource certain elements of our IT systems to third parties that, as a result of this outsourcing, could have access to certain confidential information and whose systems may also be vulnerable to these types of attacks or disruptions. There can be no assurance that our protective measures or those of these third parties will prevent or detect security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. The failure of these systems to operate or integrate effectively with other internal, customer, supplier or third-party service provider systems and to protect the underlying IT system and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches or unauthorized access of these systems, or any failure by us to remediate any such attacks or breaches, may also result in damage to our reputation or competitiveness, delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nOur inability to maintain effective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of combined or acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement, and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in light of anticipated changes in accounting standards and in the context of acquisitions of other businesses.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subjected to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation, the defense of any of which could cause the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, we could incur significant legal and other expenses, and we could be required to pay damages to settle such actions if any such actions were not resolved in our favor. Continued or future failure to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting could also result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that will impair our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately or on a timely basis. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares and our access to capital.\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, or assumptions utilized in determining accounting estimates could adversely affect our financial statements, including our operating results and financial condition.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we must make decisions that impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations, as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Our critical accounting estimates are described later in this report under Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, various authoritative accounting or regulatory entities, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the SEC may amend, expand, and/or eliminate the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting and/or reporting standards should be applied. For example, recently, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases, that amend the accounting standards and related disclosure requirements related to lease accounting. We disclose the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted within our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. However, we do not provide an assessment of proposed accounting pronouncements, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore, we cannot meaningfully assess their effects on our consolidated financial statements. Future changes to accounting standards could modify the accounting policies and procedures that are currently utilized in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Such changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially, or otherwise, impact how we prepare and report our consolidated financial statements, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income is limited.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cCode\u201d), imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation\u2019s net operating losses, as well as other tax attributes including capital loss carryforwards and other losses and credits, after an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock (including certain \u201cpublic groups\u201d deemed created for Section 382 purposes) increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. We believe that we experienced an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 upon the conversion of our prior convertible notes in early 2018 that could result in significant limitations under Sections 382 on the use of our net operating losses and other tax attributes. However, Section 382 of the Code is an extremely complex provision with respect to which there are many uncertainties, and we have not requested an opinion of a law firm or accounting firm to confirm our analysis of the ownership change limitations related to the net operating losses generated by the Company. Therefore, we have not established whether the IRS would agree with our analysis regarding the application of Section 382 of the Code.\nWhen an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limit on the amount of pre-change net operating losses and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income generally equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the \u201cownership change\u201d (subject to certain adjustments) multiplied by the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate for the month of the \u201cownership change.\u201d\nLosses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 are limited in the amount of taxable income they can offset but carry forward indefinitely. Net operating losses incurred in taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2017 generally may be carried forward for up to 20 years to offset future taxable income but are subject to the Section 382 limitations for losses incurred prior to an ownership change date. Any Section 382 annual limitation may effectively provide a cap on the cumulative amount of pre-ownership change losses that may be utilized during a carryforward period. Such pre-ownership change losses in excess of the cap may be lost and could cause a net increase in our United States federal income tax liability in the future, with United States federal income taxes to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect. Further, for financial reporting purposes the amount or value of these deferred tax assets may be reduced as a result of the Section 382 limitation. Such reduction could negatively impact the book value of our common stock and could result in an incremental U.S. income tax expense for the Company.\nIn addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits the deduction for net operating loss carryforwards to 80 percent of taxable income for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Net operating losses subject to these limitations may be carried forward indefinitely.\nOur ability to deduct interest is limited.\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our ability to deduct interest on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business (which excludes investment interest) will be limited to an amount equal to the sum of (i) our business interest income during the taxable year and (ii) 30% of our adjusted taxable income for such taxable year. Disallowed interest deductions will be carried forward indefinitely and treated as business interest paid or accrued in the succeeding taxable year. In addition, the interest paid or incurred with respect to our prior convertible notes is not deductible.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, including requirements for regulatory clearances or approvals prior to commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to maintain regulatory clearances and approvals, or are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market these products could suffer.\nOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u25cf design, development and manufacturing;\n\u25cf testing, labeling, packaging, content and language of instructions for use, and storage;\n\u25cf clinical trials;\n\u25cf product safety;\n\u25cf premarket clearance and approval;\n\u25cf marketing, sales and distribution (including making product claims);\n\u25cf advertising and promotion;\n\u25cf product modifications;\n\u25cf recordkeeping procedures;\n\u25cf reports of corrections, removals, enhancements, recalls and field corrective actions;\n\u25cf post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u25cf complying with the federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and their labeling and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to FDA\u2019s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID); and\n\u25cf product import and export\nBefore a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, an existing product can be marketed in the United States, it must first receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), a de novo classification or a Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d), from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nMost of our currently commercialized products have received premarket clearances under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. In the future, the FDA may determine that our products will require the more costly, lengthy and uncertain de novo or PMA processes. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our revenue to decline. Although we do not currently market any devices under PMA and have not gone through the de novo classification for marketing authorization, we cannot assure you that the FDA will not demand that we obtain a PMA or de novo classification prior to marketing or that we will be able to obtain 510(k) clearances with respect to future products.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products meet the definition of \u201csubstantial equivalence\u201d for a 510(k) or meet the standard for the FDA to grant a petition for de novo classification;\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u25cf the data from our pre-clinical studies (bench and/or animal) and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval in general or for specific, commercially desirable indications, where required;\n\u25cf the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and\n\u25cf changes in FDA clearance or approval policies or the adoption of new regulations may require additional data.\nIn addition, even if we do obtain clearance or approval, the FDA may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearances or approvals for our products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability.\nWe are subject, directly and indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and physician payment transparency laws. Failure to comply with these laws may subject us to substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, and physician payment transparency, including false claims laws, anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Many states such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, Nevada and Vermont require different types of compliance such as having a code of conduct, as well as reporting remuneration paid to health care professionals or entities in a position to influence prescribing behavior. Violations of these federal and state laws can result in criminal and/or civil punishment, including fines, imprisonment and, in the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Greater scrutiny of marketing practices in our industry has resulted in numerous government investigations by various government authorities and this industry-wide enforcement activity is expected to continue. If a governmental authority were to determine that we do not comply with these laws and regulations, we and our directors, officers and employees could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, including exclusion from participation in U.S. federal healthcare reimbursement programs.\nMany of these healthcare laws inevitably influence company standards of conduct. Other laws tie into these standards as well, such as compliance with the advertising and promotion regulations under the FDCA, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and other laws. We use many distributors and independent sales representatives in certain territories and thus rely upon their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as with the advertising and promotion regulations or similar laws under countries located outside the United States and other applicable federal, state or international laws. These laws include:\n\u25cf the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act; this may constrain our marketing practices and those of our independent sales agencies, educational programs, pricing, bundling and rebate policies, grants for physician-initiated trials and continuing medical education, and other remunerative relationships with healthcare providers;\n\u25cf federal false claims laws (such as the Federal False Claims Act) which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; this may impact the reimbursement advice we give to our customers as it cannot be inaccurate and must relate to on-label uses of our products;\n\u25cf federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners. Effective January 2022, we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives;\n\u25cf analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statue and the Federal False Claims Act which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u25cf the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nCertain of these laws have \u201csafe harbors\u201d which if met will protect certain arrangements from liability. For example, the Anti-Kickback Statute allows for payments that would technically fall under the definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d and be illegal, are allowed because they meet a safe harbor established by the Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These safe harbors include, for example, the \u201cDiscount\u201d safe harbor which allows companies to provide discounts to their customers in many forms (such as rebates, volume discounts, etc.) as long as they meet the requirements of the safe harbor. Certain safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute may also apply to consulting and other arrangements for personal services which may apply to relationships we have with physician consultants. These safe harbors are technical in nature and failure to meet any element of a safe harbor will cause an arrangement to lose safe harbor protection. Therefore, no assurances can be given that any of our arrangements or relationships will meet an otherwise applicable safe harbor.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with customers, physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom have ownership interests in the Company and recommend and/or use our products, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, and distributors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include, among other infractions or violations, intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates FDA regulations, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data or other commercial or regulatory laws or requirements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nThere is also an increasing trend toward more criminal prosecutions and compliance enforcement activities for noncompliance with the HIPAA as well as for data breaches involving protected health information (PHI). In the ordinary course of our business, we may receive PHI. If we are unable to comply with HIPAA or experience a data breach involving PHI, we could be subject to criminal and civil sanctions.\nIf our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nU.S. governmental regulation could restrict the use of our tissue products or our procurement of tissue.\nIn the United States, the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (\u201cNOTA\u201d), a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including bone and related tissue, for \u201cvaluable consideration.\u201d NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. We provide services in all of these areas in the United States, with the exception of removal and implantation, and receive payments for all such services. We make payments to certain of our clients and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft bone tissue on our behalf. If NOTA is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents us from receiving payment for services we render, or which prevents us from paying tissue banks or certain of our clients for the services they render for us, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are engaged through our marketing employees, independent sales agents and sales representatives in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of our products, and we intend to continue our educational activities. Although we believe that NOTA permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing, transportation and implantation of our products, payments in connection with such education efforts are not exempt from NOTA\u2019s restrictions and our inability to make such payments in connection with our education efforts may prevent us from paying our sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect our business and prospects. No federal agency or court has determined whether NOTA is, or will be, applicable to every allograft bone tissue-based material which our processing technologies may generate. Assuming that NOTA applies to our processing of allograft bone tissue, we believe that we comply with NOTA, but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of, or amendments to, NOTA will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations.\nOutside of the United States, our medical devices must comply with the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they are marketed, and compliance may be costly and time-consuming. Failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States will prevent us from marketing our products in such jurisdictions.\nWe currently market, and intend to continue to market, our products outside the United States. To market and sell our product in countries outside the United States, we must seek and obtain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations and comply with the laws and regulations of those countries. These laws and regulations, including the requirements for approvals, certifications or registrations and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations are expensive, and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products. The regulatory approval process outside the United States may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval in addition to other risks.\nIn order to market our products in the Member States of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives (Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices, as amended, and Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 2009 relating to active implantable medical devices, as amended). On April 5, 2017 the EU adopted MDR 2017/745, the new Medical Devices Regulation, replacing the two existing directives, the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. The new regulation will enter into force after a three-year transition period ending in spring 2020. This means that the market access framework for all member countries of the European single market (28 EU member states including the UK, the members of the EEA - Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, and through bilateral treaties Switzerland) will change significantly. The key changes that are expected include stricter control, transparency, and enforcement, the strengthening of post market surveillance requirements, and the possibility that the classification of some of our products will change, requiring more rigorous clinical testing and data.\nCompliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. In order to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directives, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a \u201cNotified Body\u201d, which is an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements. Based on this certification we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity, which allows us to affix the CE mark to our products.\nWe may not obtain regulatory approvals or certifications outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities or Notified Bodies in other countries, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority or Notified Body does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. We may be required to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical studies even if FDA clearance or approval, or the right to bear the CE mark, has been obtained. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn the EEA we must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System, the purpose of which is to improve the protection of health and safety of patients, users and others by reducing the likelihood of reoccurrence of incidents related to the use of a medical device. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. Incidents are evaluated by the EEA competent authorities to whom they have been reported, and where appropriate, information is disseminated between them in the form of National Competent Authority Reports (\u201cNCARs\u201d). The Medical Device Vigilance System is further intended to facilitate a direct, early and harmonized implementation of Field Safety Corrective Actions (\u201cFSCAs\u201d) across the Member States of the EEA where the device is in use. An FSCA is an action taken by a manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.\nFurther, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EEA Member States Medical Device related laws including 2017/745, the new Medical Device Regulation, or the 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, as amended, or Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as amended, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Our failure to comply with all these laws and requirements may harm our business and operating results.\nWe may also be required to perform post market clinical follow up studies to periodically evaluate the safety and performance of previously approved products. The results of these studies may cause us to lose our approvals, to market the product or require us to modify our products to address deficiencies in order to preserve our approvals to market the product. In March 2019, our Notified Body informed us that we are at risk of losing our CE mark on several products for failing to comply with post market clinical follow up requirements. We are working with our Notified Body to remediate this nonconformance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate this matter on a timeline that is satisfactory to the Notified Body. If this risk were to materialize, we may be required to remove the effected products from the EU market countries until remediation is complete.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including significant changes to a device\u2019s design, materials, chemical composition, energy source, or manufacturing process, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance, a de novo classification, or possibly a PMA. Modifications to our products that were implemented without obtaining clearance or approval and for which FDA subsequently concludes that clearance or approval was required, may require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until clearance or approval is obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. To do that, a manufacturer must determine if a change/modification to labeling of the device is a \u201cmajor\u201d change to the intended use statement (previously cleared by the FDA) or if a physical change/modification to the device itself \u201ccould significantly affect safety or effectiveness.\u201d If the labeling change is major and/or the physical change significantly affects safety and effectiveness, the manufacturer must file for an additional 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA for those changes before the modified device can be lawfully marketed. If the company concludes in its own self-determination that the changes do not meet either of the thresholds of \u201cmajor \u201cor \u201csignificantly affects,\u201d it may simply document those changes by way of an internal letter-to-file as part of the manufacturer\u2019s quality system recording keeping. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision and may disagree. The FDA will normally review a decision made by a manufacturer in a letter-to-file during a routine plant inspection, which FDA targets to conduct every two years for high-risk (Class III) device manufacturers and certain low and moderate risk (Class I and II) device manufacturers. In such a review the FDA may determine that a new clearance or approval was required before the device was put into commercial distribution.\nWe have made modifications to our products in the past that we concluded did not require a new clearance or approval, and we may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. No assurance can be given that the FDA would agree with any of our decisions not to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval. The issue of whether a product modification requires clearance or approval, as opposed to a \u201cletter-to-file\u201d documenting the change, is not always clear and companies rely on FDA guidance to assist in making such decisions. Up until recently, companies looked to a 1997 guidance document from FDA regarding when a change to a cleared device required a new 510(k) clearance. FDA and manufacturers were very familiar with this guidance document. The FDA released new guidance, in October 2017, that superseded the 1997 guidance. The new guidance is more burdensome in terms of assessing and documenting whether a new 510(k) should be submitted.\nIf the FDA requires us to cease marketing and recall a modified device until we obtain a new 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA, our business, financial condition, operating results and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Further, our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or FDA requirement that we seek additional approvals or clearances could result in significant delays, fines, increased costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the FDA. Obtaining clearances and approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nClinical trials can be long, expensive and ultimately uncertain, which could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and market our products or affect our ability to make claims for our products that are necessary or desirable for commercialization.\nClinical trials are generally required to support a de novo or PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials generally require an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device, or another exemption applies. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. All clinical trials, including IDE studies and nonsignificant risk device studies, must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, we also are required to obtain the patients\u2019 informed consent in a form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations, unless an exemption applies. We, the FDA or the IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. In addition, the commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to patients not enrolling in clinical trials at the rate we expect, patients experiencing adverse side effects, third-party contractors failing to perform in accordance with our anticipated schedule or consistent with good clinical practices, negative interim trial results, or our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials to produce our products. Clinical trials often take several years to execute. The outcome of any trial is uncertain and may have a significant impact on the success of our current and future products and future profits. Our development costs may increase if we have material delays in clinical trials or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. If this occurs, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products may be harmed. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval or clearance to market the product in the United States. Moreover, success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of the later trials will replicate those of earlier or prior trials. It is also possible that subjects enrolled in our clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not an anticipated part of the product\u2019s safety profile and, if so, these findings may result in lower market acceptance, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing operations are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s and other governmental authorities\u2019 laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and production of medical devices, which is costly and could subject us to enforcement action.\nWe and certain of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements and Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d), which cover, among other things, the methods of documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process for our products marketed outside of the United States. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced (routine) and unannounced (\u201cfor cause\u201d or directed) inspections of manufacturing facilities. The failure by us or one of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u25cf untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, disgorgement of profits, criminal and civil penalties;\n\u25cf customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing or delaying our requests for clearance (510(k)), de novo classification, or approval (PMA) of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo classifications, or PMAs that have already been granted;\n\u25cf refusal to grant export certificates for our products; or\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny of these actions could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We also may be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future revenue and our ability to generate profits. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nEven if our medical device products are cleared or approved by regulatory authorities, if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product that we market, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. Such oversight will cover, among other things, the product\u2019s design and manufacturing processes, the company\u2019s quality system and compliance with reporting requirements, the company\u2019s compliance with post-approval clinical data requirements, and the company\u2019s promotional activities related to its products.\nEven if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in, among other things, changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, product corrections, removal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, withdrawal of regulatory clearance or approvals, delays in or refusals of new 510(k)s, de novo or PMA applications, untitled letters, warning letters, refusal to grant export certificates for our products, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business or result in FDA sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in improper promotion of our products.\nOur products currently marketed in the United States have been cleared by the FDA\u2019s 510(k) process for use under specific circumstances. Our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. We believe that the specific surgical procedures for which our products are marketed fall within the general intended use of the surgical applications that have been cleared by the FDA. However, the FDA could disagree and require us to stop promoting our products for those specific indications/procedures until we obtain FDA clearance or approval for them. Use of a device outside of its cleared or approved indication is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. We cannot prevent a surgeon from using our products or procedure for off-label use, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional activities, reimbursement advice or training of sales representatives or physicians constitute promotion of an off-label use, the FDA could request that we modify our training or promotional or reimbursement materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including, among other things, the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, disgorgement of profits, a civil fine and criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities also might take action if they consider our promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. For example, the government may take the position that off-label promotion resulted in inappropriate reimbursement for an off-label use in violation of the Federal False Claims Act for which it might impose a civil fine and even pursue criminal action. In those possible events, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products would be impaired. Although we train our sales force not to promote our products for off-label uses, and our instructions for use in all markets specify that our products are not intended for use outside of those indications cleared for use, the FDA or another regulatory agency could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion.\nThere may be increased risk of injury if surgeons attempt to use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among surgeons and patients.\nThere may be increased risk of injury and product liability if surgeons misuse our products or do not follow recommended user and techniques and guidelines. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. Under the FDA\u2019s reporting regulations applicable to human cells and tissue and cellular and tissue-based products (\u201cHCT/Ps\u201d), we are required to report all adverse reactions involving a communicable disease if it is fatal, life threatening, or results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as mandatory recalls, inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal due to product defects or product enhancements and modifications, which would significantly increase our costs.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain recalls undertaken to reduce a risk to health be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIn December 2018, we initiated a Class 2 recall of our Calix Lumbar Spine Implant System due to a risk of compromised sterilization of the product. There were no device related adverse events reported for this product and we are working with the FDA on this recall and expect to have it closed out in 2019.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other regulatory authority requirements pertaining to Human Tissue Products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nThe FDA has statutory authority to regulate HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient, including allograft-based products. The FDA, EU and Health Canada have been working to establish more comprehensive regulatory frameworks for allograft-based, tissue-containing products, which are principally derived from cadaveric tissue. Certain of our products are regulated as HCT/Ps and are not marketed pursuant to the FDA\u2019s medical device regulatory authority, and therefore are not subject to FDA clearance or approval. Although we have not obtained premarket approval for these products, they are nonetheless subject to regulatory oversight. Human tissues intended for transplantation have been regulated by the FDA since 1993.\nSection 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to: registering facilities and listing products with the FDA; screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility; current Good Tissue Practice, or cGTP, when processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information; stringent recordkeeping; and adverse event reporting. The FDA has also proposed extensive additional requirements that address sub-contracted tissue services, tracking to the recipient/patient, and donor records review. If a tissue-based product is considered human tissue, the FDA requirements focus on preventing the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases. A product regulated solely as a 361 HCT/P is not required to undergo premarket clearance (510(k)) or approval (de novo or PMA).\nThe FDA may inspect facilities engaged in manufacturing 361 HCT/Ps and may issue untitled letters, warning letters, or otherwise authorize orders of retention, recall, destruction and cessation of manufacturing if the FDA has reasonable grounds to believe that an HCT/P or the facilities where it is manufactured are in violation of applicable regulations. There also are requirements relating to the import of HCT/Ps that allow the FDA to make a decision as to the HCT/Ps\u2019 admissibility into the United States.\nAn HCT/P is eligible for regulation solely as a 361 HCT/P if it is: (i) minimally manipulated; (ii) intended for homologous use as determined by labeling, advertising or other indications of the manufacturer\u2019s objective intent; (iii) the manufacture does not involve combination with another article, except for water, crystalloids or a sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent (not raising new clinical safety concerns for the HCT/P); and (iv) it does not have a systemic effect and is not dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function or, if it has a systemic effector is dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function, it is intended for autologous use or allogeneic use in a first or second degree relative or for reproductive use. If any of these requirements are not met, then the HCT/P is also subject to applicable biologic, device, or drug regulation under the FDCA or the PHSA. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to 361 HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics under the PHSA, or devices or drugs under the FDCA, including premarket licensure, clearance or approval.\nOver the course of several years, the FDA issued comprehensive regulations that address manufacturer activities associated with HCT/Ps. The first requires that companies that produce and distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. This set of regulations also includes the criteria that must be met in order for the HCT/P to be eligible for marketing solely under Section 361 of the PHSA and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271, rather than under the drug or device provisions of the FDCA or the biological product licensing provisions of the PHSA. The second set of regulations provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the \u201cDonor Eligibility\u201d rule. The third rule governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the \u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d rule. The \u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d rule covers all stages of allograft processing, from procurement of tissue to distribution of final allografts. Together these regulations are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to.\nAt the time they came into effect approximately fifteen years ago, these regulations increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate and have led to increased enforcement action which affects the conduct of our business. In addition, these regulations can increase the cost of tissue recovery activities. The FDA periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements. Allegations of violations of applicable regulations noted by the FDA during facility inspections could adversely affect the continued marketing of our products. We believe we comply with all aspects of 21 CFR Part 1271 that we are required to comply with, although there can be no assurance that we will comply, or will comply on a timely basis, in the future. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the Current Good Tissue Practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities. If our suppliers fail to comply with applicable requirements, our products and our business could be negatively affected. If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nIn addition, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion that some of our HCT/Ps meet the criteria for marketing solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, and therefore do not require approval or clearance of a marketing application. For our HCT/Ps that are not combined with another article, the FDA could conclude that the tissue is more than minimally manipulated, that the product is intended for a non-homologous use, or that the product has a systemic effect or is dependent on the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function. If the FDA were to draw these conclusions, it would likely require the submission and approval or clearance of a marketing application in order for us to continue to market the product. Such an action by the FDA could cause negative publicity, decreased or discontinued product sales, and significant expense in obtaining required marketing approval or clearance.\nProcurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation, including allograft tissue we may use in future products, is subject to federal regulation under National Organ Transplant Act. NOTA prohibits the acquisition, receipt, or other transfer of certain human organs, including bone and other human tissue, for valuable consideration within the meaning of NOTA. NOTA permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human organs. For any future products implicating NOTA\u2019s requirements, we would reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue that they would provide to us. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we may recover in our pricing for our services, thereby negatively impacting our future revenue and profitability. If we were to be found to have violated NOTA\u2019s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Further, in the future, if NOTA is amended or reinterpreted, we may not be able to pass these expenses on to our customers and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected.\nOther regulatory entities with authority over our products and operations include state agencies enforcing statutes and regulations covering tissue banking. Regulations issued by Florida, New York, California and Maryland will be particularly relevant to our business. Most states do not currently have tissue banking regulations. It is possible that others may make allegations against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks about non-compliance with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes or regulations.\nAllegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action or could cause negative publicity for our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur products may be subject to regulation in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) as well, should we enter that market. In the European Union regulations, if applicable, differ from one EU member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the European Union, as well as for other countries, the approval process for human derived cell or tissue based medical products may be extensive, lengthy, expensive and unpredictable. Some of our products may be subject to EU member states\u2019 regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells and cellular or tissue-based products. Some EU member states have their own tissue banking regulations.\nLoss of AATB Accreditation would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are accredited with the American Association of Tissue Banks (\u201cAATB\u201d), a private non-profit organization that accredits tissue banks and sets industry standards. Although AATB accreditation is voluntary and not required by law, as a practical matter, many of our customers would not purchase our products if we failed to maintain our AATB accreditation. Although we make every effort to maintain our AATB accreditation, the accreditation process is somewhat subjective and lacks regulatory oversight. There can be no assurance that we will continue to remain accredited with the AATB.\nFederal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nProduct pricing (and, therefore, profitability) is subject to regulatory control which could impact our revenue and financial performance.\nThe pricing and profitability of our products may become subject to control by the government and other third-party payors. The continuing efforts of governmental and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products. In most foreign markets, the pricing and/or profitability of certain diagnostics and prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control, though it is unclear which proposals will ultimately become law, if any. Changes in prices, including any mandated pricing, could impact our revenue and financial performance.\nOur revenues depend upon prompt and adequate coverage and reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry, including the medical device industry, in the United States to fundamental change. The ability of hospitals to purchase our products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from governmental health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations. In the United States, healthcare providers who purchase our products generally rely on these third-party payors to pay for all or a portion of the cost of our products as a component of a single bundled payment amount for the procedures in which the products are used. Because there is often no separate third-party payor reimbursement to the provider for our products, the additional cost associated with purchasing our products can impact the provider\u2019s profit margin. If third-party payor reimbursement to providers for procedures involving our products decreases, some of our target customers may be unwilling to purchase our products in favor of purchasing less expensive alternatives. In addition, third-party payors of hospital services and hospital outpatient services, including Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurers, annually revise their payment methodologies and amounts, which can result in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital charges for certain medical procedures or the elimination of or reduction in reimbursement. Further, Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurer cutbacks could create downward price pressure on our products. All of these factors could adversely affect our business.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing and reporting standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a substantial impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of substantial fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we lose any existing or future intellectual property lawsuits, a court could require us to pay significant damages or prevent us from selling our products.\nThe medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. In December 2018, a complaint was filed by RSB Spine, LLC against us which claims that some of our products, including the Irix-ATM Lumbar Integrated Fusion System and the Irix-CTM Cervical Integrated Fusion System, infringe certain of RSB Spine\u2019s patents. The complaint seeks, among other relief, an injunction against future infringement, unspecified damages for infringement, and treble damages for willful infringement. Legal proceedings, regardless of the outcome, could drain our financial resources and divert the time and effort of our management. If we lose one of these proceedings, a court could require us to pay significant damages to third parties, indemnify third parties from loss, require us to seek licenses from third parties, pay ongoing royalties, redesign our products, or prevent us from manufacturing, using or selling our products. In addition to being costly, protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIf our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nWe rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements, and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not completely protect our rights, for example, competitors may be able to design around some of our intellectual property rights to develop competing but non-infringing technologies. In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will issue. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or applicable foreign intellectual property office) may deny or require a significant narrowing of the claims in its pending patent applications and the patents issuing from such applications. Any patents issuing from the pending patent applications may not provide us with significant commercial protection or sufficient commercial protection to prevent competitors from utilizing similar but non-infringing technologies. We could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws or at all. We also may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries.\nIn addition, we hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products. The loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing, marketing, and selling these products, which could harm our business. If we, or the other parties from whom we would license intellectual property, fail to obtain and maintain adequate patent or other intellectual property protection for intellectual property used in our products, or if any protection is reduced or eliminated, others could use the intellectual property used in our products, resulting in harm to our competitive business position.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology, in part, with confidentiality agreements with our employees, independent distributors, and consultants. We cannot be assured, however, that the agreements will not be breached, adequate remedies for any breach would be available, or our trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors.\nWe may not be able to obtain or protect our proprietary rights relating to our products without resorting to costly and time-consuming litigation.\nWe may not be able to obtain, maintain and protect certain proprietary rights necessary for the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products, successfully asserting these patents against competitors employing infringing technology, and successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Even if our patents cover a competing technology, a competitor may not accede to our demands to cease and desist or license our patent rights, which will then require us to pursue costly and time-consuming litigation. Our ability to commercialize our products will also depend in part on the patent positions of third parties, including those of our competitors. The patent positions of medical device and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the scope and breadth of patent claims that may be afforded to other companies\u2019 patents. We could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties, or if we initiate suits to protect our patent rights. Such suits that we may need to defend extend beyond suits by our competitors and may include patent assertion entities, which acquire and assert patents as a means to generate income, due to the expensive nature of patent litigation. In the ordinary course of litigation, attorney fees are not recoverable.\nIn addition to the risks involved with patent protection, we also face the risk that our competitors will infringe on our trademarks. Any infringement could lead to a likelihood of confusion and could result in lost sales. Similarly, while we are cautious to avoid infringing the rights of third parties, we cannot control a third party asserting its trademarks against us. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any claims we make to protect our intellectual property, or in defense of any claims brought against us.\nFuture protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain which may impact our ability to successfully compete in our industry. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. We cannot ensure that:\n\u25cf we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patent applications;\n\u25cf we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u25cf any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u25cf any of our issued patents or those of our licensors will be valid and enforceable;\n\u25cf any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf any of our patent or other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and the technologies embodied therein will provide or be subject to similar or any protection in foreign markets;\n\u25cf we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on our business rights; or\n\u25cf the measures we rely on to protect the intellectual property underlying our products will be adequate to prevent third parties from using our technology, all of which could harm our ability to compete in the market.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nShares of our common stock are equity securities and are subordinate to our outstanding indebtedness, which is significant.\nShares of our common stock are common equity interests. This means that our common stock will rank junior to any outstanding shares of our preferred stock that we may issue in the future or to the indebtedness under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and any future indebtedness we may incur and to all creditor claims and other non-equity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of our common stock, (i) dividends are payable only when and if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors, and (ii) as a corporation, we are restricted to making dividend payments and redemption payments out of legally available assets. We have never paid a dividend on our common stock and have no current intention to pay dividends in the future. Furthermore, our common stock places no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to the voting rights available to stockholders generally.\nFunds affiliated with OrbiMed own, in the aggregate, approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock, and beneficially own, with their warrants, approximately 75%, and hold all of our outstanding indebtedness and therefore can exert significant influence or control over our corporate matters.\nFunds affiliated with OrbiMed Advisors LLC, OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP (\u201cRoyalty Opportunities\u201d) and ROS Acquisition Offshore LP (\u201cROS\u201d), own approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock and beneficially own, with their warrants, approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to an Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2018 (\u201cInvestor Rights Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company and certain stockholders, including without limitation, Royalty Opportunities and ROS, for so long as the Ownership Threshold (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) is met, these funds are entitled to nominate such individuals to the Board of Directors constituting a majority of the directors. Michael Eggenberg, Matthew Rizzo and Jeffrey Peters are currently the three director representatives per the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement. In addition, Royalty Opportunities and ROS are the lenders under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and hold all of our outstanding indebtedness thereunder and hold warrants to purchase in the aggregate an additional 2,407,309 shares of our common stock. Because of their significant share ownership and control, OrbiMed has the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE American rules and rely on exemptions from various corporate governance requirements.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide because more than 50% of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by OrbiMed Advisors LLC. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are exempt from certain NYSE American rules requiring our board of directors to have a majority of independent members, a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. These independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet those standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We rely on NYSE American\u2019s controlled company exemptions and do not have a majority of independent directors on the Board, an independent nomination and governance committee or an independent compensation committee. Accordingly, you do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American rules.\nWe are subject to the continued listing standards of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in the delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer (i) if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; (ii) if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; (iii) if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; (iv) if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; (v) if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or (vi) if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE America, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nAs part of these continued listing requirements, we must maintain stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more since we have reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in our five most recent fiscal years under Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide. Our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect stockholders\u2019 deficit of $43.8 million. According to Section 1003(a) of the Company Guide, the NYSE American will normally consider providing an exemption for entities not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide if the entity is in compliance with the following standards: (1) total value of market capitalization of at least $50,000,000; or total assets and revenue of $50,000,000 each in its last fiscal year, or in two of its last three fiscal years; and (2) the issuer has at least 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15,000,000 and 400 round lot shareholders. No assurance can be provided, however, that the Company will be able to meet this exemption.\nIf we fail to meet these continued listing requirements, we may receive a deficiency notice by the NYSE American that we are not in compliance with the requirements set forth in the NYSE American Company Guide. In response to this notice, we would likely submit to the NYSE American a plan to regain compliance with the requirements. If NYSE Regulation does not approve our plan or if we are unable to regain compliance by the end of the cure period which we expect to receive or if the NYSE American determines that we are not making progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, the NYSE American may initiate suspension and delisting procedures. If delisting proceedings are commenced, the NYSE American rules permit us to appeal a staff delisting determination. Our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE American during the plan period, subject to our compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s other applicable continued listing standards. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nThe market price of our common stock is extremely volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital in the future and may subject the value of your investment to sudden decreases.\nThe market price for securities of medical device and biotechnology companies, including ours, historically has been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. The trading volume and prices of our common stock have been and may continue to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. During 2018, the sale price of our common stock ranged from $1.61 to $11.50 per share, after giving effect to the one-for-12 reverse stock split effected on February 13, 2018. Such volatility may be the result of broad market and industry factors. Future fluctuations in the trading price or liquidity of our common stock may harm the value of your investment in our common stock. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price and marketability of our common stock include:\n\u25cf the terms of any potential future debt restructuring or reorganization;\n\u25cf our ability to make interest payments under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement;\n\u25cf our observance of covenants under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our present or potential competitors;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf developments in our relationships with employees, suppliers, distributors, sales representatives and customers;\n\u25cf acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u25cf litigation and government proceedings;\n\u25cf adverse legislation, including changes in governmental regulation;\n\u25cf third-party reimbursement policies;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our equity securities by our significant stockholders or management or sales of additional equity securities by our company;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations;\n\u25cf short selling;\n\u25cf changes in health care policies and practices;\n\u25cf the delisting of our common stock or halting or suspension of trading in our common stock by the NYSE American;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. These lawsuits often seek unspecified damages, and as with any litigation proceeding, one cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending litigation. Furthermore, we may have to incur substantial expenses in connection with any such lawsuits and our management\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted from operating our business as we respond to any such litigation. We maintain insurance to cover these risks for us and our directors and officers, but our insurance is subject to high deductibles to reduce premium expense, and there is no guarantee that the insurance will cover any specific claim that we currently face or may face in the future, or that it will be adequate to cover all potential liabilities and damages.\nWe may issue additional common stock resulting in stock ownership dilution.\nFuture dilution may occur due to additional future equity issuances and/or equity financing events by us, including any potential future restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities which would further dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. In addition, if outstanding options or warrants or are exercised or otherwise converted into shares of our common stock, our stockholders will experience additional dilution.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our securities could adversely affect their market price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock or a preferred stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stocks and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities beneficially owned by OrbiMed or any other stockholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business, or if they downgrade our common stock, the trading volume and market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If any analyst who covers us downgrades our stock or lowers its future stock price targets or estimates of our operating results, our stock price could decline rapidly. Furthermore, if any analyst ceases to cover our Company, we could lose visibility in the market. Each of these events could, in turn, cause our trading volume and the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe could issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting interests of then-current stockholders and impairing their voting rights, and provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for the authorization to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. For example, it would be possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of our company. In addition, advanced notice is required prior to stockholder proposals, which might further delay a change of control.\nWe have never paid dividends and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. The payment of dividends in the future will be dependent on our earnings and financial condition and on such other factors as our Board of Directors considers appropriate. Unless and until we pay dividends, stockholders may not receive a return on their shares. There is no present intention by our Board of Directors to pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, appreciation, if any, in the market price of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 12592, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "XTNT"}
