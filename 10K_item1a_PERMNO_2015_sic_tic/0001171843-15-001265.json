{"cik": "1161315", "company": "YODLEE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we may not maintain profitability in the future.\nExcept in 2010, we have not been profitable on an annual basis since our formation. We experienced a net loss of $7.0 million, $1.2 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $357.2 million. While our revenue has grown in recent periods, we were not profitable in the year ended December 31, 2014. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. We expect to make significant future expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a result of these expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve and maintain future profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including due to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown factors. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we do not address these risks successfully or if our assumptions regarding these risks and difficulties are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in the market, our business could be harmed. Accordingly, we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe derive our revenue from subscriptions to a single software platform, and any factor adversely affecting the Yodlee platform would harm our business and operating results.\nWe derive our revenue from subscriptions to a single software platform, and related support and professional services. As such, any factor adversely affecting subscriptions to the Yodlee platform, including those described elsewhere under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or in other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would harm our business and operating results. In addition, while we intend to pursue new business initiatives, such as data solutions and market research services and revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party developers of FinApps, we cannot be sure that we will recognize significant revenue from those sources. The viability of these business opportunities depends on the continued success of the Yodlee platform, and our strategy to derive revenue from those activities would suffer if subscriptions to the Yodlee platform were adversely affected.\nRevenue derived from sales to Bank of America, N.A., individually, and from Bank of America, N.A. and our two other largest customers, as a group, represented approximately 13.8% and 25.4%, respectively, of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014, and we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers.\nThe financial services industry in the United States is highly concentrated, with a small number of large financial institutions holding a majority of total assets held by all U.S. financial institutions. Because a portion of our business is targeted at this industry and our largest customers include 9 of the 15 largest banks in the United States (based on total assets as of June 30, 2014), a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a small number of these large financial institution customers. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue derived from Bank of America, N.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, which beneficially owned in the aggregate 9.6% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014, individually, and from Bank of America, N.A., and our two other largest customers, as a group, was approximately 13.8% and 25.4%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 14.9% and 32.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2013. We anticipate that revenue from a small group of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods. It would be difficult to replace any of our largest customers or the revenue derived from such customers. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our largest customers could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain other large customers, and could weaken our negotiating position with respect to our remaining and prospective customers.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our relationships with any of our largest customers on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that our relationships will continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with them. Our revenue and operating results could suffer if, among other things, any of our largest customers were to renegotiate, terminate, renew on less favorable terms or fail to renew their agreement with us.\nBecause some of our sales efforts are targeted at large financial institutions and large Internet services companies, we face prolonged sales cycles, substantial upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing some of our sales. If our sales cycle lengthens, or if our upfront sales investments do not result in sufficient revenue, our operating results may be harmed.\nWe target a portion of our sales efforts at large financial institutions and large Internet services companies, which presents challenges that are different from those we encounter with smaller customers. Because our large customers are often making an enterprise-wide decision to deploy our solutions, we face longer sales cycles, complex customer requirements, substantial upfront sales costs, significant contract negotiations and less predictability in completing sales with these customers. Our sales cycle can often last one year or more with our largest customers, who often undertake an extended evaluation process, but is variable and difficult to predict and can be longer or shorter. If we continue to expand globally, we anticipate that we may experience even longer sales cycles, more complex customer needs, higher upfront sales costs and less predictability in completing sales with our larger customers and customers located outside of the United States. If our sales cycle lengthens or our upfront sales investments do not generate sufficient revenue to justify our investments in our sales efforts, our operating results may be harmed.\nFailure of our customers to deploy our solutions in a timely and successful manner could negatively affect our revenue and operating results.\nThe timing of revenue from our customers depends on a number of factors outside of our control and may vary from period to period. Our customers may request customization of our solutions for their systems or engage in a prolonged, internal decision making process regarding the deployment of our solutions. Among our larger customers, deployment of our solutions can be a complex and prolonged process and requires integration into the existing platform on our customers\u2019 systems. Any delay during the deployment process related to technical difficulties experienced by our customers or us in integrating our solutions into our customers\u2019 systems could further lengthen the deployment period and create additional costs or customer dissatisfaction. During the deployment period, we expend substantial time, effort, and financial resources in an effort to assist our customers with the deployment. Some of our customers may ultimately decide that it is not in the best interest of their business to deploy our solutions at all. We generally are not able to recognize the full potential value of our customer contracts until our customers actually deploy our solutions, though our contracts typically provide that minimum payments are due beginning on a specified date whether or not deployments are completed by that date. Cancellation of any deployment after it has begun could result in lost time, effort, and expenses invested in the cancelled deployment process, and would adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue that we anticipated at the time of the execution of the related customer contract. If our customers do not timely and successfully deploy our solutions, our future revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur future success depends upon our customers\u2019 active and effective promotion of our solutions.\nOur success depends on our customers, their willingness to effectively promote our solutions to their end users, and their end users\u2019 adoption and use of our solutions. In general, our contracts with our customers allow them to exercise significant discretion over the promotion of our solutions, and they could give higher priority to other products or services they offer. Accordingly, losing the support of our customers would likely limit or reduce the use of our solutions and the related revenue. Our revenue may also be negatively affected by our customers\u2019 operational decisions. For example, if a customer implements changes in its systems that disrupt the integration between its systems and ours, we could experience a decline in the use of our solutions. Even if our customers actively and effectively promote our solutions, there can be no assurance that their efforts will result in increased usage of our solutions by their end users or the growth of our revenue. Failure of our customers to effectively promote our solutions, and of their end users to increasingly adopt and use our solutions, could have a material adverse effect upon our future revenue and operating results.\nOur reputation is critical to our business, and if our reputation is harmed our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur reputation, which depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our current and potential customers and end users, is critical to our business. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or investigations, data security breaches, lawsuits, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest and rumors, among other developments, could substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. In addition, any perception that the quality of our solutions may not be the same or better than that of other providers could also damage our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and adversely affect our operating results. Attempts to repair our reputation, if damaged, may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nOur hosting, collection, use and storage of customer information and data require the implementation of effective security controls, and a data security breach could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, adversely affect our reputation and revenue and cause losses.\nWe and our customers through which our solutions are made available to end users, collect, use, transmit and store confidential end user-permissioned financial information such as bank account numbers, portfolio holdings, credit card data and outstanding debts and bills. The measures we take to provide security for collection, use, storage, processing and transmission of confidential end user information may not be effective to protect against data security breaches by third parties. We use commercially available security technologies, including hardware and software data encryption techniques and multi-layer network security measures, to protect transactions and information. Although we encrypt data fields that typically include sensitive, confidential information, other unencrypted data fields may include similar information that could be accessible in the event of a security breach. We use security and business controls to limit access and use of confidential end user information. However, a portion of the security protection begins with our customers because they are the initial point of user authentication of hosted solutions. Although we require our Internet services customers and third-party suppliers to implement controls similar to ours, the technologies and practices of our customers and third-party suppliers may not meet all of the requirements we include in our contracts and we may not have the ability to effectively monitor the implementation of security measures of our customers and third-party suppliers. In many cases, our customers build and host their own web applications and access our solutions through our APIs. In these cases, additional risks reside in the customer\u2019s system with respect to security and preventive controls. As a result, inadequacies of our customers\u2019 and third-party suppliers\u2019 security technologies and practices may only be detected after a security breach has occurred. Errors in the collection, use, storage or transmission of confidential end user information may result in a breach of privacy or theft of assets.\nThe risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated techniques to engage in illegal activities involving solutions such as ours or end user information, such as counterfeiting, fraudulent payment and identity theft. Because the techniques used by hackers change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition to hackers, it is possible that a customer could gain unauthorized access to our database through the use of our solutions. Improper access to our systems or databases by hackers or customers intending to commit criminal activities could result in the theft, publication, deletion or modification of confidential end user information. An actual or perceived breach of our security may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations.\nA data security breach of the systems on which sensitive user data and account information are stored could lead to claims or regulatory actions against us. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach, we could be involved in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Our customer contracts typically include security standards that must be complied with by us and our customers. If a data security breach occurs and we have not been in compliance with the security standards included in our applicable contracts, we could be liable for breach of contract claims brought by our customers. We could also be required to indemnify our customers for third-party claims, fines, penalties and/or other assessments imposed on our customers as a result of any data security breach and our liability could exceed our insurance coverage or ability to pay.\nOur security procedures and technologies are regularly audited by independent security auditors engaged by us, and many of our prospective and current customers conduct their own audits or review the results of such independent security audits as part of their evaluation of our solutions. We are also periodically audited by regulatory agencies to whom our operations or our customers are subject, including The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the OCC, which is the Agency in Charge of multi-agency supervisory examinations of our operations. Adverse findings in these audits or examinations, even if not accompanied by any data security breach, could adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing customer relationships and establish new customer relationships.\nData security breaches, acts of fraud involving our solutions, or adverse findings in security audits or examinations, could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our solutions, cause our customers to cease doing business with us and have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and future growth prospects. Further, any of these events could lead to additional regulation and oversight by federal and state agencies, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations and may lead to the loss of our ability to make our solutions available.\nPrivacy concerns could have an adverse impact on our revenue and harm our reputation and may require us to modify our operations.\nAs part of our business, we use, transmit and store confidential end user-permissioned data. We are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, and security of end user data. For privacy or security reasons, privacy groups, governmental agencies and individuals may seek to restrict or prevent our use of this data. New laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These new laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. In addition, the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers, require us to modify our operations and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. As our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security, and to countries outside the United States that have more strict data protection laws, our compliance requirements and costs may increase.\nIf sources from which we obtain information limit our access to such information or charge us fees for accessing such information, our business could be materially and adversely harmed.\nOur solutions require certain data that we obtain from thousands of sources, including banks, other financial institutions, retail businesses and other organizations, some of which are not our current customers. As of December 31, 2014, we receive over 75% of this data through structured data feeds that are provided under the terms of our contracts with most of our financial institution, or FI, customers. Although all of the information we currently gather is end user-permissioned data and, currently, we generally have free, unrestricted access to, or ability to use, such information, one or more of our current customers could decide to limit or block our access to the data feeds we currently have in place with these customers due to factors outside of our control such as more burdensome regulation of our or our customers\u2019 industry, increased compliance requirements or changes in business strategy. If the sources from which we obtain information that is important to our solutions limit or restrict our ability to access or use such information, we may be required to attempt to obtain the information, if at all, through end user-permissioned data scraping or other means that could be more costly and time-consuming, and less effective or efficient. In the past, a limited number of third parties, primarily airline and international sites, have either blocked our access to their websites or requested that we cease employing data scraping of their websites to gather information, and we could receive similar, additional requests in the future. Any such limitation or restriction may also preclude us from providing our solutions on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, if in the future one or more third parties challenge our right to access information from these sources, we may be required to negotiate with these sources for access to their information or to discontinue certain services currently provided by our solutions. The legal environment surrounding data scraping and similar means of obtaining access to information on third-party websites is not completely clear and is evolving, and one or more third parties could assert claims against us seeking damages or to prevent us from accessing information in that manner. In the event sources from which we obtain this information begin to charge us fees for accessing such information, we may be forced to increase the fees that we charge our customers, which could make our solutions less attractive, or our gross margins and other financial results could suffer.\nFailure by our customers to obtain proper permissions and waivers might result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.\nWe require our customers to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of information through our solutions. Our contracts with our customers include assurances from them that they have done so and will do so, but we do not audit our customers to ensure that they have acted, and continue to act, consistent with such assurances. If, despite these requirements and contractual obligations, our customers do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf might be limited or prohibited by federal, state or foreign privacy laws or other laws. Such a failure to obtain proper permissions and waivers could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and might prevent use of such data. In addition, such a failure could interfere with, or prevent creation or use of, rules, analyses, or other data-driven activities that benefit us and our business. Moreover, we might be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notices, agreements, permissions or waivers. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and failure by us or financial institutions and other customers through which our solutions are made available to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment at the federal, state and international levels, and failure by us or FIs and other customers through which our solutions are made available to comply with the laws and regulations to which we and they are subject could negatively impact our business. In particular, our solutions are subject to a strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to protect consumers and to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. Although we have internal controls in place to comply with applicable regulations, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls will always be effective in ensuring such compliance. Our FI customers and prospective customers are highly regulated and may be required to comply with stringent regulations in connection with subscribing to and implementing our solutions.\nWe are examined on a periodic basis by various regulatory agencies. For example, we are a supervised third-party technology service provider subject to multi-agency supervisory examinations in a wide variety of areas based on published guidance by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. These examinations include examinations of our management, acquisition and development activities, support and delivery, IT, and disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. The OCC is the Agency in Charge of these examinations. If deficiencies are identified, customers may choose to terminate or reduce their relationships with us. As a result of obligations under our customer agreements, we are required to comply with certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, related to the privacy of consumer information and may be subject to other privacy and data security laws because of the solutions we provide. In addition, numerous regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, for enhanced due diligence of the internal systems and processes of companies like ours by their FI customers. If we are required to make changes to our internal processes and solutions as result of this heightened scrutiny, we could be required to invest substantial additional time and funds and divert time and resources from other corporate purposes to remedy any identified deficiency.\nMoney movement services are potentially subject to regulation under a variety of federal and state laws, including state statutes regulating \u201cmoney transmitters\u201d and federal laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act and the regulations thereunder, which regulate \u201cmoney transmitting businesses\u201d and \u201cmoney services businesses.\u201d Many of these statutes are broadly worded and have not been subject to published judicial or administrative interpretation. While we believe that our money movement solutions comply with, or are exempt from, all applicable laws, as we conduct these services on behalf of regulated financial institutions, it is possible that one or more regulatory agencies could take the position that we are not in compliance or that we are required to register as a money transmitter in order to provide our money movement solutions. In addition, new laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could subject us to additional regulatory requirements. If we were prevented from operating our money movement solutions in one or more states, our ability to provide our money movement solutions would suffer as our customers generally require that our money movement solutions handle payments in all states. Moreover, if we were required to be licensed in one or more states, the licensing process could be time-consuming and expensive.\nMany of these laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. Changes in laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations may occur that could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant systems redevelopment, substantially change the way that banks and other FIs are regulated and able to offer their products to consumers, or render our solutions less profitable or obsolete, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Currently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has exclusive rulemaking authority under the GLBA, and many of our customers are subject to regulatory enforcement by the CFPB and/or the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. It is difficult to predict future regulatory requirements that may be enacted by the CFPB, the manner in which such regulatory requirements will be enforced by the CFPB or the FTC, and the impact such requirements or enforcement actions may have on our or our customers\u2019 business. Compliance with any new regulatory requirements may divert internal resources and be expensive and time-consuming. In order to comply with new regulations, we may be required to increase investment in compliance functions or new technologies. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, any of which could significantly harm our reputation with consumers, banks and regulators, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to expand our business with our existing customers, our business and ability to increase our revenue may suffer.\nOur ability to increase our revenue depends in part on increasing revenue from our existing customers. We intend to seek to increase penetration among our existing customer base, both by increasing usage of product offerings in business units we currently serve and by expanding into new business units. However, the adoption of our solutions by specific business units of our existing customers does not necessarily indicate that we will be successful in expanding usage into other business units, which may have different needs, priorities and budgetary and other constraints. In addition, while we intend to introduce features and applications that will make our solutions increasingly attractive to end users, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing usage of our solutions with existing customers. If we are unable to expand our business as we anticipate, our revenue could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIf we do not successfully market and sell our solutions to new customers, including Internet services companies, our revenue growth will be harmed.\nOur ability to increase our revenue depends in part on our ability to attract new customers, including additional FI customers and new Internet services companies providing innovative financial solutions, or YI customers. While we believe that there are significant opportunities for sales to additional FIs, both in the United States and in international markets, we cannot be sure that we will be successful in achieving broader adoption of our solutions by FIs. Our future revenue growth is also dependent upon the continued purchase of our solutions by YI customers. Adoption and purchase of our solutions by these companies is still relatively new, and it is unclear if our solutions will be broadly adopted and purchased by these companies or the speed of any such adoption and purchases.\nIncreased revenue from YI customers may expose us to additional risks.\nOur revenue from YI customers has increased in recent periods, and we expect that such customers will be increasingly important to our business in future periods. Some of these customers are smaller and may not be as financially stable as our FI customers and may not have the experience and resources relating to data security and operations that our FI customers generally have. Accordingly, although our contracts with these customers require them to, among other things, adhere to standards for data security and obtain necessary consents and waivers from end users to use their financial and other information, as we increase our business with YI customers we may be subject to an increased risk that one or more of such customers may fail to comply with these obligations and that such customers may not have the financial resources to satisfy any resulting indemnity obligations to us. If our YI customers experience financial difficulties, are limited by a lack of internal resources or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations relating to data security, our revenue generated from these customers may suffer, our reputation could be harmed and we could be exposed to third-party claims.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing our revenue by introducing new revenue streams.\nImportant factors to our future growth include continued development and marketing of financial applications to make the Yodlee platform increasingly attractive to existing customers with the need for applications or combinations of applications tailored to their specific needs. In addition, we intend to seek to derive additional revenue by providing data solutions and market research services and are pursuing revenue-sharing opportunities with third-party developers of FinApps on the Yodlee platform. Each of these initiatives has individual challenges and risks. To market and sell data solutions and market research services successfully, we must continue to enhance our capabilities relating to the enrichment of massive data sets in order to provide tailored data services that appeal to the markets that we target, as well as develop additional capabilities in data solutions. We have only recently begun to derive revenue from the sale of data solutions and market research services, and in order to increase sales we will need to expand our sales and marketing capabilities. In addition, for FinApps to appeal to existing customers, or new customers, these applications must offer the functionality and user experience that is responsive to their needs and valued by end users. Moreover, we have not derived significant revenue to date from revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party developers of FinApps on the Yodlee platform, and we cannot be sure that we will enter into a substantial number of these arrangements or that any such arrangements will be successful. We cannot be certain that any of the activities described above will contribute to substantial additional revenue from the Yodlee platform or introduce substantial new revenue streams.\nIf our operations are interrupted as a result of service downtime or interruptions, our business and reputation could suffer.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to obtain and deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information. Our operations and those of third parties on whom we rely for information and transaction processing services are vulnerable to interruption by technical breakdowns, computer hardware and software malfunctions, software viruses, infrastructure failures, fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures and other events beyond our control. Any disruption in our solutions or operations, or those of third parties on whom we rely, could affect the ability of our solutions to perform effectively which in turn could result in a reduction in revenue. In addition, our contracts with our customers often include stringent requirements for us to maintain certain levels of performance and service availability. Failure by us to meet these contractual requirements could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure. Our customers may also delay or withhold payment to us, elect to terminate or not to renew their contracts with us, or refuse to integrate our solutions into their online offerings, or we could lose future sales to new customers as a result of damage to our reputation due to such service downtime or interruptions. If we suffer a significant database or network facility outage, our business could experience disruption until we fully implement our back-up systems. The occurrence of any such disruptions in our solutions could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf customers are unwilling to use our cloud-based solutions, our customer base may not grow or may decrease and our business could be harmed.\nThe cloud computing market is not as mature as the market for enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether cloud computing will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate legacy enterprise software into their businesses and are more familiar and comfortable with this type of infrastructure. Because our solutions involve the aggregation, storage and use of confidential information and related data, some customers, in particular customers located outside of the United States, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to our cloud-based solutions due to a lack of perceived cost and performance benefits associated with cloud-based solutions, and concerns regarding the ability of cloud computing companies to adequately address security and privacy concerns. If other cloud-based solutions experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, these concerns and perceptions regarding the market for cloud computing as a whole may be further negatively affected. If customers are unwilling to accept our cloud-based solutions as a result of these perceptions and concerns, we may be required to develop other alternative solutions for these customers, which would be time-consuming and costly and could negatively affect our gross margins. In addition, negative perceptions and concerns regarding cloud computing could cause the growth of our customer base to slow, which could result in decreased revenue and harm to our business.\nOur revenue and operating results can fluctuate from period to period, which could cause our share price to fluctuate.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate from period to period in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our common stock, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and extent of our customers\u2019 deployment and promotion of our solutions, including the associated professional services revenue;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of our customers\u2019 renewals or any terminations of their contracts with us;\n\u00b7\nrate of expansion or contraction of our customer base;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws or regulatory policies that could impact our ability to offer our solutions to FIs or other customers;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and success of the introduction of new solutions by us or competitors;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated delays of rollouts of our solutions;\n\u00b7\ndownward pressure on fees we charge for our solutions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control costs, including third-party service provider costs and sales and marketing expenses in an increasingly competitive market;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of operating costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure, including globally;\n\u00b7\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets;\n\u00b7\nchanges to economic terms in contracts with customers, including renegotiations or unanticipated changes to the relationship;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and in our effective tax rate; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and political conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers operate.\nIn addition, our revenue has usually been the strongest during the last two quarters of the year due to the terms of existing customer contracts with certain of our largest customers and associated revenue recognition, and timing of our customers\u2019 deployment of our solutions and associated professional services revenue. Although we expect this trend to continue in the future, historical patterns should not be considered indicative of our future results.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future revenue or operating performance.\nWe rely significantly on revenue from subscriptions, which may decline or may fluctuate based on the timing of renewals, and, because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nOur subscription revenue accounted for approximately 85% and 81% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Customers that purchase our subscriptions have no contractual obligation to renew their contracts after the initial contract period, which are typically three years, and we may not maintain our historical subscription renewal rates. Although customer contracts are generally non-cancellable during a specified period of time, customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for a fee before the expiration of the entire initial contract period. New or renewal subscriptions may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 and end users\u2019 level of satisfaction with our solutions and our customer support; the frequency and severity of subscription outages; the functionality and performance of our solutions; the timeliness and success of product enhancements and introductions by us and those of our competitors; the prices of our solutions; the prices of solutions offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If new or renewal subscriptions decline, our revenue or revenue growth may decline, and our business may suffer.\nIn addition, we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the relevant subscription period based on the terms of the applicable customer contract. As a result, most of the revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of billings from subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewal subscriptions in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter, but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our solutions would not be reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods.\nBecause a portion of our revenue depends on the usage of our platform by end users, it may be difficult to evaluate our future prospects.\nOur subscription contracts with our customers generally contain a minimum subscription fee, and usage-based fees which depend on the extent their customers or end users use our platform. This usage-based aspect to our pricing model makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenue because end users\u2019 activities on our platform may vary from period to period based on a variety of factors, including personal financial circumstances, privacy and security concerns regarding online solutions such as ours, seasonality or other factors. As a result, historical revenue from a customer may not be a good indicator of our future revenue from that customer and changes in end user activity may limit our ability to forecast revenue.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our solutions or in the information we gather and disclose could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\nThe software applications underlying our solutions are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. From time to time, we provide incremental releases of software updates and functional enhancements. Such new versions frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or released. We have from time to time found defects in our solutions, and new errors in our existing solutions may be detected in the future. In addition, errors may result from the interface of our solutions with legacy systems and data, which we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control.\nDefects or errors in the information we gather from third parties or in storing end users\u2019 data, in processing payment transactions, or that cause interruptions to the availability of our solutions could result in a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our solutions, sales credits or refunds to our customers, loss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers, diversion of development resources, harm to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs, and expose us to potential liability to our customers. We may not be able to identify or resolve these defects or errors in a timely manner. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our solutions or the information we provide, or in responding to resulting claims or liability, may be substantial. Resolving a defect or error and implementing remedial measures would likely divert the attention and resources of our management and key technical personnel from other business concerns, and could be extremely difficult if the underlying defect or error is located in a third party\u2019s system or database.\nAlthough we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in delivering our solutions, these limitations on liability may be unenforceable in some cases, or may be insufficient to protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or may be insufficient to cover one or more large claims. An insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co-insurance requirement, could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed.\nWe process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis using our money movement solutions. Effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process money movement transactions in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our business. In addition, if we do not detect suspected fraudulent or non-sufficient fund transactions within agreed-upon timelines, we may be required to reimburse our customers for the transactions and such reimbursements may exceed the amount of the reserves we have established to make such payments.\nThe online payments industry has been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties. Although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our business, this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact us. In addition to any direct damages and potential fines that may result from such fraud, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence in our controls may seriously harm our business and damage our reputation. We may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate end users to use our solutions, which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain our payment network with third-party service providers, or if our disbursement partners encounter business difficulties, our business could be harmed.\nOur payment network consists of a single Originating Deposit Financial Institution, or ODFI, and a small number of bill payment processors. Our ODFI clears and processes the funds from the customer. In the instance of funds transfers, the ODFI also processes funds to the end user\u2019s destination institution. For bill payment, funds are sent to the bill pay processors for disbursement to biller sites.\nWhile we have entered into an agreement with our ODFI and each of our bill payment processors, these partners could choose to terminate or not renew their agreements with us. If we are unable to maintain our agreements with our current partners, or our current partners are unable to handle increased transaction volumes, our ability to disburse transactions and our revenue and business may be harmed. If we are unable to sign new payment processors and/or ODFIs under terms consistent with, or better than, those currently in place, our revenue and business may be harmed.\nPayment processors and ODFI partners also engage in a variety of activities in addition to providing our services and may encounter business difficulties unrelated to our services. Such activities or difficulties could cause the affected partner to reduce the services provided, cease to do business with us, or cease doing business altogether. This could lead to our inability to move funds on a timely basis as required to settle transactions. In addition, because we offer next day automated clearing house transactions in certain cases, if a disbursement partner experiences insufficient liquidity or ceases to do business, we may not be able to recover funds that are held with that disbursement partner which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may also be forced to cease doing business with payment processors and/or ODFIs if rules governing electronic funds transfers change or are reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to operate our money movement solutions.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWhile we do not believe any single company in the financial services space offers a comprehensive platform with diverse features such as ours, the following companies offer individual solutions that compete with one or more of our solutions:\n\u00b7\nfor data aggregation: Intuit, Inc. and Fiserv, Inc. (CashEdge);\n\u00b7\nfor personal financial management: Intuit (direct to consumer service) and internal IT departments of FIs, as well as early-stage companies;\n\u00b7\nfor online bill pay: Fiserv and FIS Global Corporation;\n\u00b7\nfor data products and services: global payment networks, credit bureaus and other institutions that have access to large pools of data; and\n\u00b7\nfor account verification: MicroBilt Corporation and Early Warning Systems, LLC.\nMany of the companies that compete with one or more of our applications have greater name recognition, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, the ability to devote greater resources to the promotion, sale and support of their solutions, more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships, longer operating histories, and greater name recognition than we have.\nWe expect competition to increase as other companies continue to evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. New companies entering our market may choose to offer internally-developed solutions at little or no additional cost to their end users by bundling them with their existing applications and solutions. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our gross margins. If we are unable to effectively compete, our revenue could decline and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be harmed if we do not keep up with rapid technological change, evolving industry standards or changing expectations and requirements of our customers.\nWe expect technological developments to continue at a rapid pace in our industry. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop our technology expertise;\n\u00b7\nrecruit and retain skilled technology professionals;\n\u00b7\neffectively manage the technology associated with our business;\n\u00b7\nenhance our current solutions;\n\u00b7\ndevelop new solutions that meet our customers\u2019 needs; and\n\u00b7\ninfluence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes.\nIn addition, we must continue to meet changing expectations and requirements of our customers. We must accomplish all of these tasks in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our failure to do so could harm our business, including materially reducing our revenue and operating results.\nAs a result of our customers\u2019 increased usage of our platform, we will need to continually improve our hosting infrastructure to meet our customers\u2019 needs and avoid service interruptions or slower system performance.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of transactions and data that our hosting infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our existing and new customers. A component of our growth strategy involves the establishment of additional data centers in new locations. If our business continues to grow, we may also need to increase bandwidth, storage or other elements of our infrastructure.\nThe amount of infrastructure needed to support our customers is based on our estimates of anticipated usage. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our customers could experience service outages or slower system performance that may subject us to financial penalties and result in customer losses, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth. In addition, increasing our infrastructure as a result of experiencing unforeseen increases in usage or in anticipation of increased usage from new or existing customers would cause us to have increased cost of revenue, which could adversely affect our gross margins until we sufficiently increase revenue to offset the increased costs.\nWe rely on relationships with third-party service providers to conduct our business, and our operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to maintain these relationships or we maintain them under new terms that are less favorable to us.\nWe rely on data center and other service providers in order to deliver our solutions and operate our business. We also rely on software licenses from third parties and support from third parties for the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities, equipment, power systems and infrastructure. The failure of these third parties to provide acceptable and high quality services and technologies or to update their services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers, which may reduce our revenue, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation. If we lose the services of one or more of our third-party service providers for any reason or if their services are disrupted, for example due to viruses or denial of service or other attacks on their systems, or due to human error, intentional bad acts, power loss, hardware failures, telecommunications failures, wars, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, or similar catastrophic events, we could experience a disruption in our ability to offer our solutions and adverse perception of our solutions\u2019 reliability, or we could be required to retain the services of replacement third-party service providers. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner, either of which could increase our operating costs and harm our business.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage certain risks and challenges related to our India operations, our business could be harmed.\nOur India operations are a key factor to our success. We believe that our significant presence in India provides certain important advantages for our business, such as direct access to a large pool of skilled professionals and assistance in growing our business internationally. However, it also creates certain risks that we must effectively manage. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 80% of our total employees were based in India. Wage costs in India for skilled professionals are currently lower than in the United States for comparably skilled professionals. However, wages in India are increasing at a faster rate than in the United States, which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals and reduced margins. There is intense competition in India for skilled technical professionals, and we expect such competition to increase. As a result, we may be unable to cost-effectively retain our current employee base in India or hire additional new talent. In addition, India has experienced significant inflation, low growth in gross domestic product and shortages of foreign exchange. India also has experienced civil unrest and terrorism and, in the past, has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could result in disruptions to our India operations, which, if continued for an extended period of time, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to effectively manage any of the foregoing risks related to our India operations, our development efforts could be impaired, our growth could be slowed, and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nAs a global organization, our business is susceptible to risks associated with our international operations and sales.\nWe currently maintain international operations in India, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, lease space in other jurisdictions outside of the United States for the purpose of gathering data, and have customers located around the globe. Managing a global organization and conducting sales outside of the United States is difficult and time-consuming and introduces risks that we may not face with our operations and sales in the United States. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign regulations, laws and legal standards, including privacy, data security, tax and employment, some of which may be more stringent than those of the United States;\n\u00b7\nregional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of data across international borders;\n\u00b7\nlack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ncustomers\u2019 unfamiliarity with and concerns regarding laws and regulations of the United States that may impact our business operations in their jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nnegative, local perception of industries and customers that we may pursue;\n\u00b7\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u00b7\nlocalization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifferent pricing environments and longer sales cycles;\n\u00b7\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u00b7\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our solutions in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of compliance;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, difficulty in interpreting international tax laws and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and\n\u00b7\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and the development of new customer relationships internationally. As we seek to expand internationally, we will need to develop relationships with additional partners and add internal capabilities to effectively manage the operational, financial, legal and regulatory requirements and risks associated with our international operations. The investment we make and additional resources we use to expand our operations, target new international customers, expand our presence globally within our existing customers and manage operational and sales growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur future success depends on the continued services of our management team and our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, including research and development, sales, marketing and support personnel.\nOur ability to effectively develop and provide our solutions and maintain and develop relationships with current and potential customers depends largely on the continued services of our management team and our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled professionals, particularly professionals with backgrounds in sales, marketing, technology, customer support and financial management services. We believe that success in our business will continue to be based upon the strength of our intellectual capital. For example, due to the complexity of our solutions and the intellectual capital invested in our technology, the loss of personnel that are integral to the development of our solutions and engineering efforts would harm our ability to maintain and grow our business. In addition, our customers depend on our professional services team to assist them with the deployment of our solutions within their infrastructure and, after deployment, to help resolve any issues relating to our solutions that may arise. A high level of support is an important factor in contract renewals and cross-selling of our platform. Consequently, we must hire and retain employees with the technical expertise, skill set and industry knowledge necessary to continue to develop our solutions and effectively manage our growing sales, support and marketing organizations to ensure the growth of our business and the satisfaction of our customers.\nWe plan to continue to expand our engineering team, our direct sales force and marketing teams, and our customer support teams both domestically and internationally. We believe there is significant competition for professionals in these areas with the skills and technical knowledge necessary to develop the solutions and perform the services we offer. Competition for these employees is particularly intense in the software and technology industries, including in India where a significant portion of our employee headcount is located, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. In addition, new hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect or may take longer to become productive than we anticipate. If we cannot hire, train and retain qualified personnel, our ability to continue to conduct our business could be impaired and our revenue could decline.\nIf our intellectual property and technology are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, our business and competitive position would suffer.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2014, we had 66 issued U.S. patents, 21 pending U.S. patent applications, 8 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and 13 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. Some of these patents relate to technology that is included in our data aggregation platform and expire beginning in 2018. Any owned patents or patents that may issue in the future from pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection, may be invalidated or circumscribed or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. In addition, recent changes to the patent laws in the United States may bring into question the validity of certain categories of software patents. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection for our software or effectively enforce any patents that issue in the future that cover our software. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark or trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered service marks or trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available. Unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us for doing so, which could harm our business.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services.\nPolicing the unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive and our monitoring and policing activities may not be sufficient to identify any misappropriation and protect our proprietary technology. In addition, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and litigation may be necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. If litigation is necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, any such litigation could be very costly, could divert management attention and resources and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. For example, on December 2, 2014, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Plaid Technologies Inc. (\u201cPlaid\u201d) has and is continuing to infringe on seven of our U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs and injunctive relief against Plaid. It is too early to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings or whether an adverse result would have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. For additional information concerning the lawsuit, see Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe also expect that the more successful we are, the more likely it becomes that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours, which may infringe on our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or if third parties independently develop or gain access to our or similar technologies, our business, revenue, reputation and competitive position could be harmed.\nAssertions by a third party that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation, expensive licenses or substantial indemnity obligations and may prevent us from selling our products and services.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Although we have not suffered a material loss from third-party claims to date, from time to time, we face allegations that we or our customers have infringed, misappropriated or violated intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of third-party intellectual property rights. Some of the claims may involve patent holding companies or non-practicing entities who have no relevant product revenue of their own, and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. Our technologies may not be able to withstand third-party claims or rights against their use. Additionally, although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements require us to indemnify our customers for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling related to any such claims. Such indemnity claims are often difficult to assess, particularly at an early stage and without significant further investigation, as the third-party intellectual property claims at issue often relate to features or functions offered by our customers that include a combination of our customers\u2019 solutions and those of third parties, as well as those provided by our platform; we may not have complete information regarding the infringement claims being asserted by the third party; and there may exist substantial questions relating to the validity of the third-party intellectual property alleged to be infringed. In addition, even if third-party infringement claims are successful, we may have defenses that limit or eliminate our indemnification obligations. Although we have not been obligated to pay material amounts pursuant to such indemnification claims in the past, we could be obligated to do so in the future, and any such indemnity obligations could significantly exceed the revenues that we have derived under the related customer contract. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from subscribing to our services and could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management attention and financial resources. An adverse determination also could cause us to have to pay damages, modify our solutions or the Yodlee platform, stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights or prevent us from offering our solutions to our customers. In addition, we may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, or procure or develop substitute solutions that do not infringe.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.\nPortions of the Yodlee platform and our solutions incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to specified conditions, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software and could be required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the sale of the affected solution. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions.\nLitigation or investigations could result in significant settlements, fines or penalties.\nWe have been the subject of general litigation in the past, and could be the subject of litigation, including class actions, and regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations in the future. The outcome of litigation and regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations is difficult to predict. Plaintiffs or regulatory agencies in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts or seek to have aspects of our business suspended or modified. The monetary and other impact of these actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant.\nIf regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations were to be initiated against us by private or governmental entities, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Adverse publicity that may be associated with regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations could negatively impact our relationships with our customers and decrease acceptance and use of our solutions.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan or maintain high levels of service and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe have increased our number of full-time employees to 969 at December 31, 2014 from 747 at December 31, 2013 and have increased our revenue to $89.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 from $70.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Our recent growth and expansion has placed, and our anticipated growth may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to continue to expand our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations. Expansion creates new and increased management and training responsibilities for our employees. In addition, continued growth increases the challenges involved in:\n\u00b7\nrecruiting, training and retaining sufficient skilled technical, marketing, sales and management personnel, in particular in our India location;\n\u00b7\npreserving our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully expanding the range of solutions offered to our customers;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping and improving our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, compliance, recordkeeping, communications and other internal systems;\n\u00b7\nmanaging our international operations and the risks associated therewith;\n\u00b7\nsupporting a potentially broad pool of third-party developers who may use our open platform;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining high levels of satisfaction with our solutions among our customers; and\n\u00b7\neffectively managing expenses related to any future growth.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan or maintain high levels of service for our customers. In addition, if we are unable to manage our expenses related to growth effectively in the future, our gross margins or operating expenses may be negatively impacted in any particular quarter.\nAcquisition activity involving our customers could adversely affect our business.\nAcquisitions or similar transactions involving our customers, including financial institutions, could negatively affect our business in a number of ways. After such a transaction, the acquirer might terminate, not renew or seek to renegotiate the economic terms of its contract with us. Companies involved in these transactions may experience integration difficulties that could increase the risk of providing us inaccurate or untimely data or delay deployment of our solutions. Any of our existing customers may be acquired by an organization with no relationship with us, effectively terminating our relationship, or be acquired by an organization that already has online personal financial management and payment solutions integrated into its systems, or that offers competing services to ours, which might cause us to lose business and harm our revenue, operating results or financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions or investments that we believe will help us to achieve our strategic objectives. The process of integrating an acquired business, product or technology can create unforeseen operating difficulties, expenditures and other challenges such as:\n\u00b7\nincreased regulatory and compliance requirements;\n\u00b7\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\u00b7\ncoordination of product, sales, marketing and program and systems management functions;\n\u00b7\ntransition of the acquired company\u2019s customers onto our systems;\n\u00b7\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nintegrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u00b7\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, information management, human resource and other administrative systems and operations generally with ours;\n\u00b7\nliability for activities of the acquired company prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes, and tax and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u00b7\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims brought by terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nIf we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with any future acquisition or investment, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition or investment, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally.\nTo the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, the payment would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. Future acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or impairment charges against goodwill on our balance sheet, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our stockholders.\nWe are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in several jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.\nAs a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations. For example, the taxing authorities of India and other jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for allocating income and expense under our intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our positions were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, resulting in higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and higher expenses.\nWe may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could adversely harm our business.\nState, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to our subscription cloud-based software platform in various jurisdictions is unclear. Further, these jurisdictions\u2019 rules regarding tax nexus are complex and vary significantly. As a result, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits, and our liability for these taxes and associated penalties could exceed our original estimates. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our services or otherwise harm our business and operating results.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe have costs denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and our revenue is primarily denominated in the U.S. dollar. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar, would negatively affect our expenses and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We manage our exposure to fluctuations in the Indian Rupee by entering into forward contracts to cover a portion of our projected expenditures paid in the Indian Rupee. These contracts generally have a term of less than 12 months. The use of such forward contracts, or other hedging activities in which we may engage in the future, may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we might be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and might suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violate stock market listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. We have in the past and may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will be detected. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and could result in regulatory action, and could require us to restate, our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our operating results.\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices could harm our operating results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may harm our operating results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or other tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $162.0 million and $90.1 million, respectively. If not utilized, these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019 and 2015, respectively.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules might apply under state tax laws. Future issuances or trading of our stock could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d. It is possible that any future ownership change, could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nNatural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our solutions to our customers, and could decrease demand for our solutions. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located in California and India, both of which areas have experienced major earthquakes in the past. Significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.\nAdverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition.\nThe onset or continuation of adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition. Adverse global economic events have caused, and could, in the future, cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and could impact consumer and small business spending. Challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our solutions, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing solutions, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and future financial results. In addition, a downturn in the banking and finance sector may disproportionately affect us because a significant portion of our customers operate in that sector. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery, whether global, regional or within specific markets. If the conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen, our business and our future operating results could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe regulatory compliance requirements of being a public company subject us to increased costs, and our management has limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The individuals who constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company, and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex and changing laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team and other personnel must now devote a substantial amount of time to new compliance initiatives, and we may not successfully or efficiently manage our continuing transition into a public company. We expect rules and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules and regulations of our stock exchange to increase our legal and finance compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We are required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we rely on third-party software and system providers for ensuring our reporting obligations and effective internal controls, and to the extent these third parties fail to provide adequate service including as a result of any inability to scale to handle our growth and the imposition of these increased reporting and internal controls and procedures, we could incur material costs for upgrading or switching systems and our business could be materially affected.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe expect these laws, rules and regulations to also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain appropriate levels of coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible than it was as a private company, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the time and resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial disclosure obligations, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain of these exemptions. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates that adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the date on which we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d with at least $700 million of our equity securities held by non-affiliates as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or (iv) December 31, 2019.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures and other anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain debt financing. We have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that financing, if required, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in October 2014 at a price of $12.00 per share, the reported high and low sales prices of our common stock have ranged from $11.36 to $17.97 through December 31, 2014. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies engaged in providing portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement help;\n\u00b7\nloss of a significant amount of existing business;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rates;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nour announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than projected results or our announcement of revenue or earnings guidance that is higher or lower than expected;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u00b7\nsales or expected sales of additional common stock;\n\u00b7\nterrorist attacks or natural disasters or other such events impacting countries where we or our customers have operations; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry\nfluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline. If the market price of shares of our common stock does not exceed your purchase price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur insiders who are significant stockholders may control the election of our board and may have interests that conflict with those of other stockholders.\nA majority of our directors are affiliated with management or our principal stockholders. In addition, our directors and executive officers and holders of more than five percent of our outstanding shares of common stock (on an as-converted basis) beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 66% of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2014. As a result, acting together, this group has the ability to exercise significant control over most matters requiring our stockholders\u2019 approval, including the election and removal of directors and significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group may differ from those of other stockholders and they may vote their shares in a way that is contrary to the way other stockholders vote their shares.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2014, we had 29,263,852 shares of common stock outstanding, which includes the conversion of convertible preferred stock into our common stock. In October 2014, we sold an aggregate of 7,010,724 common shares in our IPO (including 760,724 common shares sold in connection with the underwriters\u2019 exercise of their over-allotment option). All shares sold in our IPO are freely tradable (except for shares purchased by affiliates) and the remaining 22,253,128 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014 may be sold after April 1, 2015 when the lock-up agreements and market standoff agreements expire 180 days after the date of our IPO (subject in some cases to volume limitations). In addition, as of December 31, 2014, there were outstanding options and RSUs equivalent to 5,957,555 shares of our common stock that, if exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale upon expiration of lock-up agreements and market standoff agreements. If a substantial number of these shares are sold, the market price of our common stock could be significantly reduced. Moreover, some holders of shares of common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we might file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nWe filed a registration statement to register 7,953,661 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock plans. If a large number of these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nManagement may apply the net proceeds from our IPO to uses that do not increase our market value or improve our operating results.\nWe intend to use our net proceeds from our IPO for general corporate purposes, including as yet undetermined amounts related to working capital and capital expenditures. Our management has considerable discretion in applying our net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether we are using our net proceeds appropriately. Until the net proceeds we received from our IPO are used, they may be placed in investments that do not produce income or that lose value. We may use our net proceeds from our IPO for purposes that do not result in any increase in our operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nDelaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe classification of our board of directors so that only a portion of our directors are elected each year, with each director serving a three-year term;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe required approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend specified provisions of our bylaws and certificate of incorporation; and\n\u00b7\nthe elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit or restrict large stockholders, in particular, those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in our market price being lower than it would without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 15024, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "YDLE"}
