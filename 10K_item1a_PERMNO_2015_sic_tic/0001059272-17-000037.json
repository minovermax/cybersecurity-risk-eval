RISK FACTORS\nOur past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nFactors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals, include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n1. The success of our business depends in large part on the ability of the Joint Venture\u2019s licensees to identify fashion trends as well as to react to changing customer demand in a timely manner and to generate positive cash from its operations as a result.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon the ability of the Joint Venture\u2019s licensees to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing customer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner. The specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in customer preferences directed by trends and fashions. If they miscalculate customers\u2019 product preferences or the demand for their products, they may be faced with excess inventory, which historically has resulted in markdowns and/or write-offs of raw materials as well as finished goods, which could impair their profitability, and may do so in the future. Similarly, any failure on their part to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing customer demands and fashion trends will adversely affect our business. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and expanding in fiscal 2017, the Company entered into the Joint Venture and shifted its strategy, such that we have closed all of our retail stores, sold our merchandise, inventory, furnishings, trade fixtures, equipment, improvements in real property, purchase orders related to our website and international wholesale business and are committed to selling our Los Angeles Design Studio. Further, bebe has contributed all of its trademarks, trademark license arrangements and related intellectual property to the Joint Venture, including domain names, social media accounts and agreements with certain of its international distributors to the Joint Venture.\nOur strategic focus for fiscal 2018 and the years to come is to continue to focus on discretionary spending, restructure our operations and based on the success of initiatives in the Joint Venture, collect revenue from its licensing arrangements. The inability to generate positive cash flow from such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial conditions. In addition, if additional financing is needed, we may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms, or at all.\n2. Our auditors have made reference to the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements included with this Annual Report for the year ended July 1, 2017 have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our auditors have made reference to the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in their audit report on our audited financial statements for the year ended July 1, 2017. Because we have been issued an opinion by our auditors that substantial doubt exists as to whether the Company can continue as a going concern, it may be more difficult for the Company to attract investors. Since our auditors have raised a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, this typically results greater difficulty to obtain financing than businesses that do not have a qualified auditors opinion. Additionally, any loans we might obtain may be on less advantageous terms. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain funding and upon future profitable operations from our business. We plan to seek additional funds through the sale of our remaining real estate assets. If we are unable to sell these assets on favorable terms, or at all, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. As a result, you may be investing in a company that will not have the funds necessary to continue as a going concern. If we are not able to achieve sufficient revenues or find funding to cover our expenses, then we likely will be forced to cease operations and investors may lose their entire investment.\n3. The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand, image and reputation.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image and reputation is integral to our business via the licensing arrangement with the Joint Venture as well as the implementation of strategies to expand such efforts. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brand will depend largely on the success of the Joint Venture\u2019s design, merchandising and marketing efforts and its ability to provide a consistent, high-quality client experience. In addition, while our brand is mature, the success depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to shop our brand. Our business would be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for our brand. In addition, failure to achieve consistent, positive performance or the receipt of any negative publicity could adversely impact our brand and the brand loyalty of our customers, which would adversely impact our business via the Joint Venture.\n4. We face significant competition in the retail and apparel industries, which could harm our business.\nThe retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry. We expect competition in these markets to increase. The primary competitive factors in our markets are: brand name recognition and appeal, sourcing, product styling, quality, presentation and pricing, timeliness of product development and delivery, store ambiance, customer service and convenience. The Joint Venture competes with traditional department stores, specialty store retailers, lower price point retailers, business-to-consumer websites, off-price retailers and direct marketers for, among other things, raw materials, market share, retail space, finished goods, sourcing and personnel. Because many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial, distribution and marketing resources than the Joint Venture or maintain comparatively lower cost of operations, it may lack the resources to effectively compete with them. If the Joint Venture fails to remain competitive in any way, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n5. Our business has recently undergone significant changes, including management, personnel and business changes. If we do not effectively and successfully adapt to these changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs we realign our business around the initiatives of the Joint Venture, we continue to make substantial personnel and operational changes in an effort to streamline our business and control costs. These significant changes have created additional pressures on existing personnel, and we have been working to adapt to operating our business in a manner that differs meaningfully from prior periods. We cannot assure that these changes will lead to the desired improvement in our business and results of operations. If we do not effectively and successfully adapt to these changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n6. General economic conditions, including increases in energy and commodity prices, that are largely out of our control, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for bebe products is influenced by national and local economic factors that may affect consumer spending or buying habits. Factors that could adversely affect the demand for our products include recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, deflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws. A decline in economic conditions could also result in limitations on the prices the Joint Venture\u2019s licensees can charge for bebe products, either of which could adversely affect our business. We can provide no assurance that demand for bebe products will not be adversely affected by national or local economic conditions, thereby harming our business.\n7. Our business could be adversely impacted by unfavorable international political conditions.\nOur sales and operating results are, and will continue to be, affected by international social, political, legal and economic conditions. In particular, our business could be adversely impacted by instability or changes resulting in the disruption of trade with the countries in which our contractors, suppliers, licensees or customers are located, significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds, or additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments. We can provide no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by such international events.\nIn addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes and customs restrictions could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business. We also purchase a substantial amount of our raw materials from China, and our business and operating results may be affected by changes in the political, social or economic environment in China.\n8. Our ability to conduct business could be negatively impacted by the effects of natural disasters, war, terrorism, public health concerns or other catastrophes.\nWe operate a corporate office in Brisbane, California, a distribution facility in Benicia, California, a design studio in Los Angeles, California and a distribution facility in Hong Kong. Any serious disruption at these facilities whether due to construction, relocation, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorist acts or otherwise could harm our business. Natural disasters, extreme weather and public health concerns, including severe infectious diseases, could impact our ability to open and run our corporate offices, distribution center, stores and other operations in affected areas and/or negatively impact our foreign sourcing offices and the operations of our vendors. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends, in part, on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Lower client traffic due to the effect of natural disasters or extreme weather, security concerns, war or the threat of war and public health concerns could result in decreased sales that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events in the United States and world-wide could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, disrupt the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise or lead to lower client traffic. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impact of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual\ndisaster or other catastrophic situation. In addition, although we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us.\n9. If we, through our interest in the Joint Venture, are not able to protect our intellectual property our business may be harmed.\nAlthough we and the Joint Venture take actions to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights, we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that others will not imitate our products or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot assure that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as infringements of their trademark and proprietary rights.\nHistorically, we have sought to register our trademarks domestically and internationally and the Joint Venture will continue to do so in the future. Obstacles may exist that may prevent the Joint Venture from obtaining a trademark for the bebe and BEBE SPORT brand names or related names. The Joint Venture may not be able to register certain trademarks, purchase the right or obtain a license to use these names or related names on commercially reasonable terms. If the Joint Venture fails to obtain trademarks of, or ownership or license of the requisite rights, it would limit the ability to expand the business under the bebe brand.\nIn some jurisdictions, despite successful registration of bebe's trademarks, third parties may allege infringement and bring actions against us and or the Joint Venture. In addition, if our licensees fail to use the bebe intellectual property correctly, the reputation and value associated with the trademarks may be diluted. Furthermore, if we or the Joint Venture do not demonstrate use of our trademarks, our trademark rights may lapse over time.\nIn addition, we face the potential of receiving claims that the technology we use or license infringes on another\u2019s proprietary rights. In certain circumstances, we may be subject to having to defend ourselves from such claims and/or be subject to unanticipated license fees or the necessity to transition away from technology we are using or abandon such use altogether.\n10. Our business may be negatively impacted by any failure to comply with regulatory requirements.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC and The NASDAQ Capital Market. In addition, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, including those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, competition, privacy, consumer protection, credit cards, import/export and anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Our employees, subcontractors, vendors and suppliers could take actions that violate these requirements and/or our compliance policies and procedures, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. Regulatory developments regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials used by suppliers and subject us to costs associated with the relevant regulations, including for diligence pertaining to the presence of any conflict minerals used in our products, possible changes to products, processes or sources of our inputs and reporting requirements.\n11. There are litigation and other claims against us from time to time, which could distract management from our business activities and could lead to adverse consequences to our business and financial condition.\nWe are involved from time to time with litigation and other claims against us. Often these cases can raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time. Although we do not currently believe that the outcome of any current litigation or claim against us will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, we have, in the past, incurred unexpected expense in connection with litigation matters. In the future, adverse settlements, judgments or resolutions may negatively impact our business. Injunctions against us could have an adverse effect on our business by requiring us to do, or prohibiting us from engaging in, certain activities. We may in the future be the target of material litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\n12. We are subject to cyber-security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nWe currently support the business of the Joint Venture via a transition services agreement (which is expected to terminate October 31, 2017), which involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information. We also facilitate the Joint Venture\u2019s use mobile devices, social networking and other on-line activities to connect with our customers. If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, we or the Joint Venture could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our business could be adversely affected. For example, in November 2014, we\ndetected suspicious activity on computers that operate the payment processing system for our stores, which appeared to be limited to data from payment cards swiped in the United States and its territories between November 8, 2014 and November 26, 2014. The data may have included cardholder name, account number, expiration date and verification codes, although we have no indication of fraudulent charges to date. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer future breaches of the portion of our network that handles payment card data, with further payment card and client information being stolen. These sorts of breaches might cause bebe customers to lose confidence in our or the Joint Venture\u2019s ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to stop shopping with bebe altogether. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving our employees could also hurt our reputation and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n13. The Joint Venture relies on information technology to help manage its operations and our e-commerce store, the disruption of which could adversely impact our business.\nWe currently assist the Joint Venture with various information systems, which it relies on to help manage its operations and regularly assess the cost-benefit analysis associated with making additional investments to upgrade, enhance or replace such systems. If at any time we experience any disruptions that impact the Joint Venture\u2019s information systems we could experience a material adverse impact on our business.\n14. We are responsible for maintaining the privacy of personally identifiable information of our customers.\nThrough our sale transactions, loyalty programs and other methods, we obtained personally identifiable information about our customers which is subject to federal, state and international privacy laws. These laws are constantly changing. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other adverse actions. We are highly dependent on the use of credit cards to complete sale transactions through our websites, and if we fail to comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, we may become subject to limitations on our ability to accept credit cards. Moreover, third parties may seek to access this information through improper means such as computer hacking, malware and viruses. Any incidents involving unauthorized access or improper use of our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information could damage our reputation and brand and result in legal or regulatory action against us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n1. Because Manny Mashouf beneficially owns a substantial portion of the outstanding shares, other shareholders have limited ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of July 1, 2017, Manny Mashouf, our CEO and Chairman of the Board, beneficially owned approximately 58.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, he has the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction. He also has the ability to control our management and business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of common stock, even if such a transaction would benefit other shareholders. In addition, he could also sell his shares at any time, in open market transactions, registered offerings or otherwise and such a sale could negatively impact our share price.\n2. Our stock price could fluctuate substantially for reasons outside of our control.\nOur common stock is quoted on The NASDAQ Capital Market, which has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect our stock price without regard to our financial performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and comparable sales; announcements by other apparel, accessory, music and gift item retailers; the trading volume of our stock; changes in estimates of our performance by securities analysts; litigation; overall economic and political conditions, including the global economic downturn; the condition of the financial markets, including the credit crisis; and other events or factors outside of our control could cause our stock price to fluctuate substantially.\n3. Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to seek to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common\nstock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\n4. If we sell shares of our common stock in the future, shareholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our shareholders would experience immediate dilution. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common shareholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.", "PERMNO": 86150, "SIC": 2330, "TIC": "BEBE"}
