{"cik": "1609253", "company": "California Resources Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected materially and adversely by other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant.\nSummary:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022Prices for our products can fluctuate widely and an extended period of low prices could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets.\n\u2022We are subject to economic downturns and the effects of public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may materially and adversely affect the demand and the market prices for our products.\n\u2022Our aspirations, goals and initiatives related to carbon management activities and our Full Scope Net Zero target and our public statements and disclosures regarding them expose us to numerous risks.\n\u2022Our ability to establish a large-scale carbon capture and sequestration project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully execute our carbon capture and sequestration strategy, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to achieve our Full-Scope Net Zero goals.\n\u2022Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas carry significant operational and financial risks and uncertainty. We may not drill wells at the times we scheduled, or at all. Wells we do drill may not yield production in economic quantities or generate the expected payback.\n\u2022Our business can involve substantial capital investments. We may be unable to fund these investments which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\n\u2022From time to time we may engage in exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\n\u2022Our producing properties are located exclusively in California, making us vulnerable to economic and regulatory factors associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\n\u2022Many of our current and potential competitors have or may potentially have greater resources than we have and we may not be able to successfully compete in acquiring, exploring and developing new properties.\n\u2022Our hedging activities may limit our ability to realize the full benefits of increases in commodity prices.\n\u2022Our level of hedging activities may be impacted by financial regulations that could increase our costs of hedging and/or limit the number of hedging counterparties available to us.\n\u2022Estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Government Action\n\u2022Recent and future actions by the state of California could reduce both the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas within the state.\n\u2022Our business is highly regulated and government authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change requirements governing our operations any of which could increase costs, restrict operations and change or delay the implementation of our business plans.\n\u2022Concerns about climate change and other air quality issues may prompt governmental action that could materially affect our operations or results.\n\u2022Adverse tax law changes may affect our operations.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\n\u2022Our existing and future indebtedness may adversely affect our business and limit our financial flexibility.\n\u2022We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy the obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\n\u2022The lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could limit our ability to borrow and restrict our ability to use or access to capital.\n\u2022Restrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\n\u2022Variable rate indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022Our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to certain risks.\n\u2022The trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price you paid or at all.\n\u2022Future issuances of our common stock could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\n\u2022There is an increased potential for short sales of our common stock due to the sales of shares issued upon exercise of warrants, which could materially affect the market prices of the stock.\n\u2022The ownership position of certain of our stockholders limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and could affect the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022Increasing attention to ESG matters may adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Acquisition and disposition activities involve substantial risks.\n\u2022We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of pollution, environmental conditions or catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\n\u2022Cybersecurity attacks, systems failures and other disruptions could adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nPrices for our products can fluctuate widely and an extended period of low prices could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets.\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets are highly dependent on oil, natural gas and NGL prices. A sustained period of low prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs would reduce our cash flows from operations and could reduce our borrowing capacity or cause a default under our financing agreements.\nPrices for oil, natural gas and NGL may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022changes in domestic and global supply and demand;\n\u2022domestic and global inventory levels;\n\u2022political and economic conditions, including international disputes such as the conflict between Ukraine and Russia;\n\u2022pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks or other public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments;\n\u2022changes or disruptions in actual or anticipated production, refining and processing;\n\u2022worldwide drilling and exploration activities;\n\u2022government energy policies and regulation, including with respect to climate change;\n\u2022the effects of conservation;\n\u2022weather conditions and other seasonal impacts;\n\u2022speculative trading in derivative contracts;\n\u2022currency exchange rates;\n\u2022technological advances;\n\u2022transportation and storage capacity, bottlenecks and costs in producing areas;\n\u2022the price, availability and acceptance of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022regional market conditions; and\n\u2022other matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for these products.\nLower prices could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, including:\n\u2022reducing our proved oil and natural gas reserves over time\n\u2022limiting our ability to grow or maintain future production\n\u2022causing a reduction in our borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility, which could affect our liquidity;\n\u2022reducing our ability to make interest payments or maintain compliance with financial covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which could trigger mandatory loan repayments and default and foreclosure by our lenders and bondholders against our assets;\n\u2022affecting our ability to attract counterparties and enter into commercial transactions, including hedging, surety or insurance transactions; and\n\u2022limiting our access to funds through the capital markets and the price we could obtain for asset sales or other monetization transactions.\nOur hedging program does not provide downside protection for all of our production. As a result, our hedges do not fully protect us from commodity price declines, and we may be unable to enter into acceptable additional hedges in the future.\nWe are subject to economic downturns and the effects of public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may materially and adversely affect the demand and the market price for our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the global economy, and has resulted in, among other things, travel restrictions, business closures and the institution of quarantining and other mandated and self-imposed restrictions on movement. We do not know how long these conditions will last. The severity, magnitude and duration of COVID-19 or another pandemic, the extent of actions that have been or may be taken to contain or treat their impact, and the impacts on the economy generally and oil prices in particular, are uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. This uncertainty could force us to reduce costs, including by decreasing operating expenses and lowering capital expenditures, and such actions could negatively affect future production and our reserves. We may experience labor shortages if our employees are unwilling or unable to come to work because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. If our suppliers cannot deliver the materials, supplies and services we need, we may need to suspend operations. In addition, we are exposed to changes in commodity prices which have been and will likely remain volatile. We cannot predict the duration and extent of the pandemic's adverse impact on our operating results.\nAdditionally, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or any resulting worsening of the global business and economic environment adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d herein.\nOur aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to carbon management activities and our Full Scope Net Zero target, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks.\nWe have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters, including our Full Scope Net Zero target and our energy transition strategy. Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. In particular, our 2045 Full-Scope Net Zero goal includes Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and estimation and management of Scope 3 emissions is subject to some degree of uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that we have been able to completely quantify the full scope of our emissions and account for mitigating all such emissions in our Full-Scope Net Zero goal.\nOur business may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nOur ability to establish a large scale carbon capture and sequestration project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully execute our CCS strategy, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to achieve our Full-Scope Net Zero goals.\nWe have announced a strategy to pursue various carbon emissions reduction efforts, including CCS projects such as Carbon TerraVault. To our knowledge, there are no existing large scale carbon capture projects in California of the type contemplated by Carbon TerraVault or CalCapture. These projects face operational, technological and regulatory risks that could be considerable due to early stage nature of these projects and the sector generally. Our ability to successfully develop these projects depends on a number of factors that we are not able to fully control, including the following:\n\u2022Large scale carbon capture is an emerging sector and there are not substantial precedents to gauge the likely range of structures or economic terms that will be necessary to reach agreeable terms.\n\u2022The development of a CCS project may require us to enter into long term joint ventures with large carbon emitters and operators of infrastructure for transporting CO2 (or other GHGs) and we may not be able to do so on agreeable terms or at all.\n\u2022Not all facilities produce sufficiently large quantities of pure or relatively pure streams of CO2, or have installed equipment to capture such CO2, so as to be usable in one or more of our CCS projects.\n\u2022Our CCS projects are expected to have material capital requirements and there is no certainty that we will be able to finance these projects on reasonable terms.\n\u2022To the extent CO2 transportation pipelines are not present in proposed project areas, or if they do not extend to one or more of our project sites, we may be required to convert existing pipelines, or build new CO2 pipelines or lateral connections, which will require much larger capital expenditures and may be subject to various environmental and other permitting requirements as well as third party easements that could be difficult to obtain, which may render one or more projects uneconomical or impractical. Additionally, even in areas where such pipelines are in place, our use of them may require reaching agreements on CO2 transportation with operators of the pipelines.\n\u2022The economics of CCS projects depend on financial and tax incentives that may not currently be sufficient for our CCS projects to be economical or could be changed or terminated. Congress has incentivized the development of carbon capture projects through the establishment of the Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q tax credit (45Q) for carbon sequestration. Recent Internal Revenue Service guidance and regulations on this tax credit are intended to provide increased certainty for the industry by establishing processes and standards to secure geologic storage of CO2. However, additional financial incentives may be required for our CCS projects to be economical. In particular, we anticipate that CCS projects associated with carbon emission reductions for transportation fuels will generate LCFS credits and that these additional credits will improve the economics of CCS projects. If the existing legal requirements for incentives such as 45Q or LCFS are subsequently amended in a manner that such incentives no longer apply or are restricted in application to our projects, we may not be able to successfully achieve an economic return from our CCS business or, alternatively, the construction of operation of applicable projects may be substantially delayed such that one or more projects is unprofitable or otherwise infeasible.\n\u2022CCS projects will require storage of CO2 in subterranean reservoirs over long periods of time. If accidental releases or subsurface migration of CO2 from our CCS activities were to occur in the course of operating one or more of our CCS sites, there is the risk of recapture of 45Q tax credits or LCFS credits from us by the government, as well as a risk of trespass or other tort claims related to the accidental release or migration of CO2 beyond the boundaries of any anticipated project\u2019s approved area and potential for fines and penalties for violations of environmental requirements.\n\u2022Successful development of CCS projects in the United States require that we comply with what we anticipate will be a stringent regulatory scheme requiring that we obtain certain permits applicable to subsurface injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration. Moreover, as operator of our CCS projects, we must demonstrate and maintain levels of financial assurance sufficient to cover the cost of corrective action, injection well plugging, post injection site care and site closure, and emergency and remedial response. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining permits or adequate levels of financial assurance for one or more of our CCS projects or that permits can be obtained on a timely basis, whether due to difficulty with the technical demonstrations required to obtain such permits, public opposition, or otherwise.\n\u2022Separately, permitting CCS projects requires obtaining a number of other permits and approvals unrelated to subsurface injection from various U.S. federal and state agencies, such as for air emissions or impacts to environmental, natural, historic or cultural resources resulting from the construction and operation of a CCS facility. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain all applicable permits for CCS activities on a timely basis or on favorable terms.\n\u2022As CCS and carbon management represent an emerging sector, regulations may evolve rapidly, which could impact the feasibility of one or more of our anticipated projects. To the extent regulatory requirements are imposed, are amended, or more stringently enforced, we may incur additional costs in the pursuit of one or more of our carbon capture projects, which costs may be material or may render any one or more of our projects uneconomical.\n\u2022We may not own the pore space at all of our CCS project sites, which may require us to enter into agreements with a group of owners for the real estate covering the extent of the project.\n\u2022Complex recordkeeping and GHG emissions/sequestration accounting may be required in connection with one or more of our projects, which may increase the costs of such operations. Different methodologies may be required for various regulatory and non-regulatory accounts regarding GHG emissions/sequestration at one or more of our projects, including but not limited to compliance with the EPA\u2019s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.\n\u2022Carbon capture may be viewed as a pathway to the continued use of fossil fuels, notwithstanding that CO2 emissions are intended to be captured, there may be organized opposition to carbon capture, including our projects, from certain environmental groups.\nThere can be no assurances that we will successfully develop our CCS projects, including Carbon Terravault and CalCapture, and such failure could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to successfully develop these projects, our ability to achieve our 2045 Full-Scope Net Zero goal for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions would also be materially and adversely affected.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas carry significant operational and financial risks and uncertainty. We may not drill wells at the times we scheduled, or at all. Wells we do drill may not yield production in economic quantities or generate the expected payback.\nThe exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties depend in part on our analysis of geophysical, geologic, engineering, production and other technical data and processes, including the interpretation of 3D seismic data. This analysis is often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. We also bear the risks of equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, unusual geological formations or unexpected pressure or irregularities within formations, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance (including lack of production response to workovers or improved and enhanced recovery efforts) and other associated risks.\nOur decisions and ultimate profitability are also affected by commodity prices, the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, available transportation and storage capacity, the political environment and other factors. Our cost of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, inspecting, maintaining and abandoning wells is also often uncertain.\nAny of the forgoing operational or financial risks could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected payback or cause a well or project to become uneconomic or less profitable than forecast.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient production and reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate. We cannot guarantee that our identified drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented 13% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2021.\nOur business involves substantial capital investments, which may include acquisitions, partnerships or joint venture arrangements with other oil and gas exploration and production companies or financial investors. We may be unable to fund our capital program, or reach satisfactory terms for other future capital requirements, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities can involve substantial capital investments. We intend to fund our 2022 capital program using cash flow from operations. Accordingly, a reduction in projected operating cash flow could cause us to reduce our future capital investments. In general, the ability to execute our capital plan depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022regulatory and third-party approvals;\n\u2022our ability to timely drill, complete and stimulate wells;\n\u2022our ability to secure equipment, services and personnel; and\n\u2022the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and external sources of financing.\nAccess to future capital may be limited by our lenders, capital markets constraints, activist funds or investors, or poor stock price performance. Because of these and other potential variables, we may be unable to deploy capital in the manner planned, which may negatively impact our production levels and development activities and limit our ability to make acquisitions or enter into partnerships and farmout arrangements.\nUnless we make sufficient capital investments and conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our ability to make the necessary long-term capital investments or acquisitions needed to maintain or expand our reserves may be impaired to the extent we have insufficient cash flow from operations or liquidity to fund those activities. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nFrom time to time we may engage in exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\nThe risk profile for our exploration drilling locations is higher than for other locations because we have less geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular for those exploration drilling locations in unconventional reservoirs, which are in unproven geologic plays. Our ability to profitably drill and develop our identified drilling locations depends on a number of variables, including crude oil and natural gas prices, capital availability, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity and other factors. We may not find commercial amounts of oil or natural gas or the costs of drilling, completing, stimulating and operating wells in these locations may be higher than initially expected. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. In either case, the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and could be impaired.\nOur producing properties are located exclusively in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are concentrated in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional conditions. These include local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline, transportation and storage capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. Our operations are also exposed to natural disasters and related events common to California, such as wildfires, mudslides, high winds and earthquakes. Further, our operations may be exposed to power outages, mechanical failures, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, prevent development of lease inventory before expiration and limit access to markets for our products.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have or may potentially have greater resources than we have and we may not be able to successfully compete in acquiring, exploring and developing new properties.\nWe face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, acquiring reserves and leases, obtaining goods and services and hiring and retaining employees needed to operate and manage our business and marketing natural gas, NGLs or oil. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. In California, our competitors are few and large, which may limit available acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to address such competitive factors more effectively than we can or withstand industry downturns more easily than we can.\nOur hedging activities limit our ability to realize the full benefits of increases in commodity prices.\nWe enter into hedges to mitigate our economic exposure to commodity price volatility and ensure our financial strength and liquidity by protecting our cash flows. Our Revolving Credit Facility also includes covenants that require us to maintain a certain level of hedges and we currently have entered into incremental hedges above these requirements for certain time periods. These hedges expose us to the risk of financial losses depending on commodity price movements and may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of price increases. Our ability to realize the benefits of our hedges also depends in part upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased cash flow volatility that could affect our liquidity.\nOur level of hedging activities may be impacted by financial regulations that could increase our costs of hedging and/or limit the number of hedging counterparties available to us.\nU.S. financial regulations can impact both our level of hedging activity as well as the potential cost of entering into hedges. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions. These regulations can affect both the size of positions that we may enter and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us.\nIn addition, U.S. regulators adopted a final rule in November 2019 implementing a new approach for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts under the applicable agencies\u2019 regulatory capital rules, referred to as the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). Certain financial institutions are required to comply with the new SA-CCR rules beginning on January 1, 2022. The new rules could significantly increase the capital requirements for some of our hedge counterparties in the OTC derivatives market. These increased capital requirements could result in significant additional costs being passed through to end users like us or reduce the number of participants or products available to us in the OTC derivatives market.\nThe European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions may implement regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations, which could also adversely affect our hedging opportunities.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nMany uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and related future net cash flows. Our estimates are based on various assumptions that require significant judgment in the evaluation of available information. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, reservoir data may change over time as more information becomes available from development and appraisal activities.\nOur ability to add reserves, other than through acquisitions, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management\u2019s control and will affect whether the historical sources of proved reserves additions continue to provide reserves at similar levels.\nGenerally, lower prices adversely affect the quantity of our reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. In addition, a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria under the applicable rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit.\nIn addition, our reserves information represents estimates prepared by internal engineers. Although over 80% of our estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2021 were audited by our independent petroleum engineers, Ryder Scott and NSAI, we cannot guarantee that the estimates are accurate.\nReserves estimation is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows from those reserves depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022historical production from the area compared with production from similar areas;\n\u2022the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022production and operating costs;\n\u2022ad valorem, excise and income taxes;\n\u2022development costs;\n\u2022the effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022future workover and facilities costs.\nChanges in these variables and assumptions could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions, which could affect our liquidity by reducing the borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Government Action\nRecent and future actions by the state of California could reduce both the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas within the state.\nIn September 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom of California issued an executive order (Order) that seeks to reduce both the demand for and supply of petroleum fuels in the state. The Order establishes several goals and directs several state agencies to take certain actions with respect to reducing emissions of GHGs, including, but not limited to: phasing out the sale of new emissions-producing passenger vehicles, drayage trucks and off-road vehicles by 2035 and, to the extent feasible, medium and heavy duty trucks by 2045; developing strategies for the closure and repurposing of oil and gas facilities in California; and proposing legislation to end the issuance of new hydraulic fracturing permits in the state by 2024.\nOur business is highly regulated and government authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change requirements governing our operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation methods, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and change or delay the implementation of our business plans.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products.\nTo operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, stimulation, operation, inspection, maintenance, transportation, storage, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment, protection of habitat and threatened or endangered species, air emissions, disposal of solid and hazardous waste, fluid injection and disposal and water consumption, recycling and reuse. Failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or prohibiting certain operations or our access to property, water, minerals or other necessary resources, and may otherwise delay or restrict our operations and cause us to incur substantial costs. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties. Beginning in 2021, CalGEM ceased issuing new well stimulation permits and has slowed the approval of new drill permits even as it continues approving plugging and workovers. In addition, a group of plaintiffs challenged the EIR and on February 25, 2020, a California Court of Appeal issued a ruling that invalidates a portion of the EIR that Kern County had typically relied on to satisfy CEQA in order to issue permits in Kern County. Kern County circulated and certified a supplementary EIR. However, the trial court required that Kern County pause its local permitting system until the trial court has reviewed the supplementary EIR and confirmed that it satisfied the concerns raised by the Court of Appeal. A hearing is scheduled for April 2022. If the Kern County EIR is not reinstated or adequately modified following resolution of the litigation described above, obtaining drilling permits for our operations in areas where we do not have field or project specific CEQA coverage could be delayed or become costly as a result of compliance with CEQA.\nWhile we have a new drill permit inventory and believe we will be able to continue to maintain oil production in 2022, we cannot guarantee that we will indefinitely continue to receive new drill permits in a sufficient number to offset oil production decline.\nChanges to elected or appointed officials or their priorities and policies could result in different approaches to the regulation of the oil and natural gas industry. We cannot predict the actions the Governor of California or the California legislature may take with respect to the regulation of our business, the oil and natural gas industry or the state\u2019s economic, fiscal or environmental policies, nor can we predict what actions may be taken at the federal level with respect to health, environmental safety, climate, labor or energy laws, regulations and policies, including those that may directly or indirectly impact our operations.\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may prompt governmental action that could materially affect our operations or results.\nGovernmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions, and regulation of GHGs and other air quality issues, may materially affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services and reducing demand for, and consumption of, our products and services, and we may be unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to such issues at the federal, state and local level may increase our capital and operating costs and render certain wells or projects uneconomic, and potentially lower the value of our reserves and other assets. Both the EPA and California have implemented laws, regulations and policies that seek to reduce GHG emissions. California\u2019s cap-and-trade program operates under a market system and the costs of such allowances per metric ton of GHG emissions are expected to increase in the future as the CARB tightens program requirements and annually increases the minimum state auction price of allowances and reduces the state\u2019s GHG emissions cap. As the foregoing requirements become more stringent, we may be unable to implement them in a cost-effective manner, or at all. In recent years, the regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities has been subject to uncertainty. In September 2020, the Trump Administration revised prior regulations to rescind certain methane standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, the U.S. Congress subsequently approved and President Biden signed into a law, a resolution to repeal the September 2020 revisions to the methane standards, effectively reinstating the prior standards. Additionally, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish new source and first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound emissions for oil and gas facilities. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal in 2022 containing additional requirements not included in the November 2021 proposed rule and anticipates the issuance of a final rule by the end of the year. Additionally, at the 26th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow in November 2021, the United States and the European Union jointly announced the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, including \u201call feasible reductions\" in the energy sector. The full impact of these actions is uncertain at this time and it is unclear what additional initiatives may be adopted or implemented that may have adverse effects upon our operations.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG or other emissions as an increasing financial risk, this could adversely impact our cost of, and access to, capital and the value of our stock and our assets. Current investors in oil and gas companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into other sectors, and institutional lenders may elect not to provide funding for oil and gas companies. For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. The Federal Reserve announced in late 2020 that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Subsequently, in November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenged most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. Although we cannot predict the effects of these actions, such limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its intention to promulgate rules requiring climate disclosures. Although the form and substance of these requirements is not yet known, this may result in additional costs to comply with any such disclosure requirements.\nWe believe, but cannot guarantee, that our local production of oil, NGLs and natural gas will remain essential to meeting California\u2019s energy and feedstock needs for the foreseeable future. We have also established 2030 Sustainability Goals for water recycling, renewables integration, methane emission reduction and carbon capture and sequestration in our life-of-field planning in an attempt to align with the state\u2019s long-term goals and support our ability to continue to efficiently implement federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to air quality and climate, in the future. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to design, permit, fund and implement such projects in a timely and cost-effective manner or at all, or that we, our customers or end users of our products will be able to satisfy long-term environmental, air quality or climate goals if those are applied as enforceable mandates.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal, state or local legislation, regulations or policies that impose more stringent standards for GHG or other emissions from our operations or otherwise restrict the areas in which we may produce oil, natural gas, NGLs or electricity or generate GHG or other emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for or the value of our products and services. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in restricting or canceling oil and natural gas production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages or other losses as a result of climate change, or impairing our ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. Moreover, climate change may pose increasing risks of physical impacts to our operations and those of our suppliers, transporters and customers through damage to infrastructure and resources resulting from drought, wildfires, sea level changes, flooding and other natural disasters and other physical disruptions. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse tax law changes may affect our operations.\nWe are subject to taxation by various tax authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. New legislation could be enacted by any of these government authorities that could adversely affect our business. Legislation has been previously proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. However, it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes would be effective. Additionally, legislation could be enacted that imposes new fees or increases the taxes on oil and natural gas extraction, which could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced demand for our products. The passage of any such legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development or could increase costs and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn California, there have been numerous state and local proposals for additional income, sales, excise and property taxes, including additional taxes on oil and natural gas production. Although such proposals targeting our industry have not become law, campaigns by various interest groups could lead to additional future taxes.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur existing and future indebtedness may adversely affect our business and limit our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $600 million of total long-term debt, and additional borrowing capacity of $367 million under the Revolving Credit Facility (after taking into account $125 million of outstanding letters of credit). The terms of our Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes permit us to incur significant additional debt, some of which may be secured. Our level of future indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities due to restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in our business and the economy generally;\n\u2022limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other expenses, or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022make it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings; and\n\u2022make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility varies with prevailing interest rates\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy the obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur earnings and cash flow could vary significantly from year to year due to the nature of our industry despite our commodity price risk-management activities. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and other commitments at that time. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt obligations. Many of these factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy and initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control as discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nThe lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could limit our ability to borrow and restrict our use or access to capital.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility is an important source of our liquidity. Our ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility is limited by our borrowing base, the size of our lenders\u2019 commitments and our ability to comply with covenants.\nThe borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility is redetermined semi-annually by our lenders who review the value of our reserves and other factors that may be deemed appropriate. Currently, our borrowing base is set at $1.2 billion and the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility is limited by the aggregate elected commitment amount of our lenders, which as of February 1, 2022 was set at $492 million.\nA reduction in our borrowing base below the aggregate commitment amount of our lenders would materially and adversely affect our liquidity and may hinder our ability to execute on our business strategy.\nRestrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nBoth our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes contain certain restrictions, which may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, limiting our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022incur additional liens;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022make investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022sell or discount receivables;\n\u2022enter into mergers;\n\u2022sell properties;\n\u2022enter into or terminate hedge agreements;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022maintain gas imbalances;\n\u2022enter into take-or-pay contracts or make other prepayments;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback agreements;\n\u2022prepay or modify the terms of junior debt;\n\u2022enter into negative pledge agreements;\n\u2022enter into production sharing contracts;\n\u2022amend our organizational documents; and\n\u2022make capital investments.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants, including a leverage ratio and current ratio.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Senior Notes. If a default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders may elect to declare all borrowings thereunder outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness. An event of default under the Senior Notes may cause all outstanding Senior Notes to become due and payable immediately or give the trustee and the holders the right to declare all outstanding Senior Notes to become due and payable immediately.\nVariable rate indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our results of operations are sensitive to movements in interest rates. There are many economic factors outside our control that have in the past and may, in the future, impact rates of interest including publicly announced indices that underlie the interest obligations related to a certain portion of our debt. Factors that impact interest rates include governmental monetary policies, inflation, economic conditions, changes in unemployment rates, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted. Such increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to certain risks.\nWe have adopted a cash dividend policy which anticipates a total annual dividend of $0.68, payable to shareholders in quarterly increments of $0.17 per share of common stock, subject to board authorization and declaration each quarter. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had remaining authorization under our Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to $102 million of shares of our common stock. Any payment of future dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, liquidity, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant. Our Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes both limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. In addition, cash dividend payments in the future may only be made out of legally available funds and, if we experience substantial losses, such funds may not be available. We can provide no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends at the anticipated rate or repurchase shares of our common stock within the authorized amount or at all.\nThe trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price you paid or at all.\nThe trading price of our common stock may decline for many reasons, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our common stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our common stock. Numerous factors, including those referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could affect our stock price. These factors include, among other things, changes in our results of operations and financial condition; changes in commodity prices; changes in the national and global economic outlook; changes in applicable laws and regulations; variations in our capital plan; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or ratings agencies; changes in market valuations of comparable companies; and additions or departures of key personnel.\nFuture issuances of our common stock could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public or private offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities. As of December 31, 2021, we had 79,299,222 outstanding shares of common stock and 4,296,055 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nThere is an increased potential for short sales of our common stock due to the sales of shares issued upon exercise of warrants, which could materially affect the market price of the stock.\nDownward pressure on the market price of our common stock that likely will result from sales of our common stock issued in connection with the exercise of warrants could encourage short sales of our common stock by market participants. Generally, short selling means selling a security, contract or commodity not owned by the seller. The seller is committed to eventually purchase the financial instrument previously sold. Short sales are used to capitalize on an expected decline in the security\u2019s price. Such sales of our common stock could have a tendency to depress the price of the stock, which could increase the potential for short sales.\nThe ownership position of certain of our stockholders limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and could affect the price of our common stock.\nAs of January 31, 2022, four of our shareholders owned at least 10% and collectively approximately 46% of our common stock. As a result, each of these stockholders, or any entity to which such stockholders sell their stock, may be able to exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval. Further, because of this large ownership position, if these stockholders sell their stock, the sales could depress our share price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters may adversely impact our business.\nOrganizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to evaluate their investment and voting decisions. Companies in the energy industry, and in particular those focused on oil or natural gas extraction, often do not score as well under ESG assessments compared to companies in other industries. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and to the diversion of their investment away from the fossil fuel industry to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. To the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may not be able to compete as effectively or recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations.\nMoreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures will be based on expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of actual risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring, and reporting on many ESG matters. Additionally, while we may also announce various voluntary ESG targets, such targets are aspirational. We may not be able to meet such targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, including, but not limited to as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results. To the extent we do meet such targets, they may ultimately be achieved through various contractual arrangements, including the purchase of various credits or offsets that may be deemed to mitigate our ESG impact instead of actual changes in our ESG performance. Also, despite these aspirational goals, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders, or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles.\nSuch ESG matters may also impact our customers or suppliers, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAcquisition and disposition activities involve substantial risks.\nOur acquisition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances;\n\u2022bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties;\n\u2022assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated; and\n\u2022be exposed to currency, political, marketing, labor and other risks.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. Successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing for recovering the reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and incomplete, and we may be unable to make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. If we are not able to make acquisitions, we may not be able to grow our reserves or develop our properties in a timely manner or at all.\nPart of our business strategy involves divesting non-core assets. We regularly review our property base for the purpose of identifying nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. Our disposition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022not be able to realize reasonable prices or rates of return for assets;\n\u2022be required to retain liabilities that are greater than desired or anticipated;\n\u2022experience increased operating costs; and\n\u2022reduce our cash flows if we cannot replace associated revenue.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to divest assets on financially attractive terms or at all. Our ability to sell assets is also limited by the agreements governing our indebtedness. If we are not able to sell assets as needed, we may not be able to generate proceeds to support our liquidity and capital investments.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of pollution, environmental conditions or catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and our assets are subject to risks such as fires, explosions, releases, discharges, power outages, equipment or information technology failures and industrial accidents, as are the assets and properties of third parties who supply us with energy, equipment and services or who purchase, transport or use our products. Pollution or environmental conditions with respect to our operations or on or from our properties, whether arising from our operations or those of our predecessors or third parties, could expose us to substantial costs and liabilities. In addition, events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, wildfires, power outages, high winds, droughts, cybersecurity, vandalism or terrorist attacks and other events may cause operations to cease or be curtailed and could adversely affect our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate. Further, recent wildfires experienced in California have limited the availability and increased the cost of obtaining insurance against certain natural disasters. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nCybersecurity attacks, systems failures, and other disruptions could adversely affect us.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our exploration, development and production activities. We also use these systems and networks to prepare our financial management and reporting information, to analyze and store data and to communicate internally and with third parties, including our service providers and customers. If we record inaccurate data or experience infrastructure outages, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected.\nCybersecurity attacks on businesses have escalated and become more sophisticated. If we or the third parties with whom we interact were to experience a successful attack, the potential consequences to our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate could be significant, including financial losses, loss of business, litigation risks and damage to reputation. We utilize various technologies, controls and procedures, as well as internal staff and external specialists to protect our systems and data, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities and to monitor and respond to threats. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If a breach occurs, it may remain undetected for an extended period of time. If we or third parties with whom we interact were to experience a cybersecurity attack or a successful breach, the potential consequences could be significant, including loss of data, loss of business, damage to our reputation, potential financial or legal liability requiring us to incur significant costs, disruptions related to investigations and costs related to remediation.\nEnergy-related assets may be at a greater risk of strategic terrorist attacks or cybersecurity attacks than other targets. A cybersecurity attack on the digital technology that controls most oil and natural gas refining and distribution necessary to transport and market our products could impact critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, disrupt energy markets by delaying or preventing product delivery, or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.\nAs cybersecurity threats continue to evolve in sophistication and magnitude, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Further, state and federal cybersecurity and data privacy legislation could result in complex new requirements that increase our cost of doing business.", "PERMNO": 15029, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CRCQQ"}
