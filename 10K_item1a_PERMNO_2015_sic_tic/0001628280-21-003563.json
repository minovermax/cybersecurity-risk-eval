{"cik": "1378946", "company": "People's United Financial, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nPeople\u2019s United makes most of its earnings based on the difference between interest it earns compared to interest it pays. This difference is called the \u201cinterest spread\u201d. People\u2019s United earns interest on loans and to a much lesser extent on securities and short-term investments. These are called \u201cinterest-earning assets.\u201d People\u2019s United pays interest on some forms of deposits and on funds it borrows from other sources. These are called \u201cinterest-bearing liabilities.\u201d\nPeople\u2019s United\u2019s interest spread can change depending on when interest rates earned on interest-earning assets change, compared to when interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities change. Some rate changes occur while these assets or liabilities are still on People\u2019s United\u2019s books. Other rate changes occur when these assets or liabilities mature and are replaced by new interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities at different rates. It may be difficult to replace interest-earning assets quickly, since customers may not want to borrow money when interest rates are high, or People\u2019s United may not be able to make loans that meet its lending standards. People\u2019s United interest spread may also change based on the mix of\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nPeople\u2019s United\u2019s interest spread may be lower if the timing of interest rate changes is different for its interest-earning assets compared to its interest-bearing liabilities. For example, if interest rates go down, People\u2019s United could earn less on some of its interest-earning assets while it is still obligated to pay higher rates on some of its interest-bearing liabilities. On the other hand, if interest rates go up, People\u2019s United might have to pay more on some of its interest-bearing liabilities while it continues to receive lower rates on some of its interest-earning assets.\nPeople\u2019s United manages this risk using many different techniques. If unsuccessful in managing this risk, People\u2019s United may be less profitable.\nThe Planned Phase-Out of LIBOR as a Reference Rate Could Adversely Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including lending and borrowing activities and the purchase and sale of securities, as well as derivative contracts entered into to manage the risk related to such transactions. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it would no longer compel contributing banks to submit to the Intercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) Benchmark Administrator the rates required to calculate LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be, and will not be, guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.\nIn response to the FCA\u2019s announcement, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g. the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating-rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nA transition from LIBOR could create considerable cost and additional risk for the Company. There remains uncertainty as to whether the composition or characteristics of any successor or alternative rate to LIBOR will be similar to, or produce the same economic value as, LIBOR. The transition may change our market risk profile, potentially requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation and increase legal and operational costs. While we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact of a transition from LIBOR, failure to effectively manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLending and Credit-Related Risk\nThe Geographic Concentration of Our Loan Portfolio Could Make Us Vulnerable to a Downturn in the Economies in Which We Operate\nAt December 31, 2020, 25%, 20% and 18% of the Company\u2019s loans by outstanding principal amount were to customers located within Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York, respectively. Loans to people and businesses located in the New England states as a group represented 55% of total loans at that date. How well our business performs depends very much on the health of these regional and local economies. We could experience losses in our real estate-related loan portfolios if the prices for housing and other kinds of real estate decreased significantly in New England or southeastern New York.\nIf the economic environment deteriorates, or negative trends emerge with respect to the financial markets, the New England and southeastern New York economies could suffer more than the national economy. This would be especially likely in Fairfield County, Connecticut (where the Company is headquartered) as well as the suburban communities of New York City and Boston as a result of the significant number of people living in these areas who also work in the financial services industry.\nIn addition, our ability to continue to originate real estate loans may be impaired by adverse changes in the local and regional economic conditions in these real estate markets. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, our profits may decrease because our alternative investments may be less profitable than real estate loans.\nOur equipment financing business, which operates nationally, could be negatively affected by adverse changes in the national economy, even if those changes have no significant effect on the local and regional economies in which our other businesses operate.\nNo assurance can be given that such conditions will not occur or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-accrual loans, an increase in our provision for credit losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.\nIf People\u2019s United\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses Is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Would Decrease\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d) on loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. In the case of loans and securities, the ACL represents a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the ACL represents a liability account reported as a component of other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. The amount of each allowance account represents management\u2019s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from both internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the underlying instruments. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As a result, the determination of the appropriate level of ACL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates related to current and expected future credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers and securities issuers; new information regarding existing loans, credit commitments and securities holdings; and identification of additional problem loans, ratings down-grades and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ACL on loans, securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in credit loss expense or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Furthermore, if any\ncharge-offs related to loans, securities or off-balance sheet credit exposures in future periods exceed our ACL on loans, securities or off-balance sheet credit exposures, we will need to recognize additional credit loss expense to increase the applicable allowance. Any increase in the ACL on loans, securities and/or off-balance sheet credit exposures will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6, \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion.\nChanges in Our Asset Quality Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nAsset quality measures the performance of a borrower in repaying a loan, with interest, on time. While we believe we have benefited from relatively stable asset quality, there are elements of our loan portfolio that inherently present greater credit risk, such as interest-only residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines with incomplete first lien data, and commercial real estate loans. Each of these portfolio risk elements, where potentially material in the context of our overall loan portfolio, are discussed in greater detail within Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Asset Quality beginning on page 52. While the Company believes that it manages asset quality through prudent underwriting practices and collection operations, it is possible that our asset quality could deteriorate, depending upon economic conditions and other factors.\nAvailability of First Lien Data With Respect to Our Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit Could Delay Our Response to Any Deterioration in the Borrower\u2019s Credit\nWe do not currently have statistics for our entire portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit with respect to first liens serviced by third parties that have priority over our junior liens, as we did not historically capture that data on our loan servicing systems. As a result, we may therefore be unaware that the loan secured by the first lien is not performing, which could delay our response to an apparent deterioration in the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2020, full and complete first lien position data was not readily available for 36% of the home equity portfolio which, in turn, represented\n2% of our overall loan portfolio at that date.\nWe are working to obtain the missing first lien information and have, in certain cases, obtained the data through information reported to credit bureaus when the borrower defaults. This data collection effort, however, can be more difficult in cases where more than one mortgage is reported in a borrower\u2019s credit report and/or there is not a corresponding property address associated with a reported mortgage, in which case we are often unable to associate a specific first lien with our junior lien. See the discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Asset Quality-Portfolio Risk Elements-Home Equity Lending beginning on page 54 for more detail, including steps we are taking to otherwise address this issue.\nOperational Risk\nOur Business Is Affected by the International, National, Regional and Local Economies in Which We Operate\nChanges in international, national, regional and local economic conditions affect our business. If economic conditions change significantly or quickly, our business operations could suffer, and we could become weaker financially as a result.\nDuring certain economic cycles, the housing and real estate markets, as well as the broader economy, may experience declines, both on a national and local level. Housing market conditions in the New England and New York metro regions, where much of our lending activity occurs, may be adversely impacted, leading to a reduced level of sales, an increased inventory of houses on the market, a decline in house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. No assurance can be given that these economic conditions will not occur or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-accrual loans, an increase in our provision for credit losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.\nSignificant volatility in the financial and capital markets during this time may lead to credit and liquidity concerns, a recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector. Our loan portfolio is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and ACL.\nInternational economic uncertainty continues to have an impact on the U.S. financial markets, potentially suppressing stock prices and adding to volatility. Our foreign country exposure, which is defined as the aggregation of exposure maintained with financial institutions, companies or individuals in a given country outside of the U.S., is minimal and indirect, with the majority of such exposure comprised of corporate debt securities. Our sovereign credit exposure is comprised of an immaterial amount of government bonds issued by a single non-European sovereign.\nThe Success of Our Stop & Shop Branches Depends on the Success of the Stop & Shop Brand\nOne element of our strategy is to focus on increasing deposits by providing a wide range of convenient services to our customers. An integral component of this strategy is the Bank\u2019s supermarket banking initiative, pursuant to which, as of December 31, 2020, the Bank has established 140 full-service Stop & Shop branches throughout Connecticut and southeastern New York, most of which are in close proximity to our traditional branches, which provide customers with the convenience of seven-days-a-week banking in most locations. At December 31, 2020, 34% of the Bank\u2019s branches were located in\nStop & Shop supermarkets and 11% of our total deposits at that date were held in Stop & Shop branches.\nThe Bank currently has exclusive branching rights in Stop & Shop supermarkets in the state of Connecticut and certain counties in the state of New York, in the form of licensing agreements between The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company and the Bank, which provides for the leasing of space to the Bank within Stop & Shop supermarkets for branch use. The Bank has the exclusive right to branch in these supermarkets until 2022, provided that the Bank does not default on its obligations under the licensing agreement.\nStop & Shop is a leading grocery store in Connecticut. The success of the Bank\u2019s supermarket branches is dependent, in part, on the success of the Stop & Shop supermarkets in which they are located. A drop in Stop & Shop\u2019s market share, a decrease in the number of Stop & Shop locations or customers, or a decline in the overall quality of Stop & Shop supermarkets could result in decreased business for the Stop & Shop branches, in the form of fewer loan originations, lower deposit generation and fewer overall branch transactions, and could influence market perception of the Bank\u2019s Stop & Shop supermarket branches as convenient banking locations.\nOn January 21, 2021, the Bank announced its decision not to renew its agreements with Stop & Shop to operate\n140 in-store branches in Connecticut and New York upon their expiration in 2022. Branch closures will take place over several years using a phased approach.\nOur Goodwill May be Determined to be Impaired at a Future Date Depending on the Results of Periodic Impairment Evaluations\nPeople\u2019s United evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently, if necessary). According to applicable accounting requirements, acceptable valuation methods include present-value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues, or similar performance measures. If the quoted market price for People\u2019s United common stock were to decline significantly, or if it was determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, we would be required to write down the asset recorded for goodwill as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. This, in turn, would result in a non-cash charge to earnings and, thus, a reduction in stockholders\u2019 equity. See Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning People\u2019s United\u2019s goodwill and the required impairment test.\nWe Depend on Our Executive Officers and Key Personnel to Continue Implementing Our Long-Term Business Strategy and Could Be Harmed by the Loss of Their Services\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nA Failure In or Breach Of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third-Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber-Attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on our ability to securely process, record, monitor and store data associated with a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. In doing so, our business relies on various digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct operations, and for which we have information security procedures and controls in place. Still, as customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, breakdowns and security breaches.\nSecurity breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer or proprietary information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further sources of operational and information security risk to us include (i) our customers, who, when accessing our products and services, may use computers or mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems and (ii) third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities (including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations) should they suffer breakdowns, failures or capacity constraints of their own systems.\nIn recent years, information security risks for financial institutions, such as ours, have increased due, in part, to (i) the proliferation of new technologies, including internet and mobile banking capabilities, to conduct financial transactions and (ii) the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, hostile foreign governments, activists and other external parties. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to, and disclosure of, client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. There have also been highly-publicized cases where hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information.\nWhile we have not, to date, experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things: (i) the constantly evolving nature of these threats; (ii) the size and scale of People\u2019s United; (iii) our plans to continue implementing our internet and mobile banking strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions in order to serve our customers when and how they want to be served; (iv) our expanded geographic footprint; (v) the outsourcing of some of our business operations; and (vi) the continued uncertain global economic environment. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to increase in number, intensity and sophistication, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational harm, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nExternal and Market-Related Risk\nIn Response to Competitive Pressures, Our Costs Could Increase if We Were Required to Increase Our Service and Convenience Levels or Our Margins Could Decrease if We Were Required to Increase Deposit Rates or Lower Interest Rates on Loans\nPeople\u2019s United faces significant competition for deposits and loans. In deciding where to deposit their money, many people look first at the interest rate they will earn. They also might consider whether a bank offers other kinds of services they might need and, if they have been a customer of a bank before, what their experience was like. People also like convenience, so the number of offices and banking hours may be important. Some people also prefer the availability of on-line services.\nPeople\u2019s United competes with other banks, credit unions, brokerage firms and money market funds for deposits. Some people may decide to buy bonds or similar kinds of investments issued by companies or by federal, state and local governments and agencies, instead of opening a deposit account.\nIn making decisions about loans, many people consider the interest rate they will have to pay. They also consider any extra fees they might have to pay in order to get the loan. Many business loans are more complicated because there may not be a standard type of loan that meets all of the customer\u2019s needs. Business borrowers consider many different factors that are not all financial in nature, including the type and amount of security the lender wants and other terms of the loan that do not involve the interest rate.\nPeople\u2019s United competes with other banks, credit unions, credit card issuers, finance companies, mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers for loans. Insurance companies also compete with People\u2019s United for some types of commercial loans.\nSeveral of People\u2019s United\u2019s competitors have branches in the same market area as it does, some of which are much larger than it is. The New England region, including Connecticut, which is People\u2019s United\u2019s predominant market, and specifically Fairfield County, where People\u2019s United is headquartered, is an attractive banking market. As locally-based banks continue to be acquired by large regional and national companies, there are not as many bank competitors in our market as there used to be, but the remaining ones are usually larger and have more resources than the banks they acquired.\nPeople\u2019s United also has competition from outside its own market area. A bank that does not have any branches in our primary markets can still have customers there by providing online banking services. It costs money to set up and maintain a branch system. Banks that do not spend as much money on branches as People\u2019s United might be more profitable than we are, even if they pay higher interest on deposits and charge lower interest on loans.\nCompliance and Regulatory Risk\nChanges in Federal and State Regulation Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe banking business is heavily regulated by the federal and state governments. Banking laws and rules are for the most part intended to protect depositors, not stockholders.\nBanking laws and rules can change at any time. The government agencies responsible for supervising People\u2019s United\u2019s businesses can also change the way they interpret these laws and rules, even if the rules themselves do not change. We need to make sure that our business activities comply with any changes in these rules or the interpretation of the rules. We might be less profitable if we have to change the way we conduct business in order to comply. Our business might suffer in other ways as well.\nChanges in state and federal tax laws or the accounting standards we are required to follow can make our business less profitable. Changes in the government\u2019s economic and monetary policies may hurt our ability to compete for deposits and loans. Changes in these policies can also make it more expensive for us to do business.\nThe government agencies responsible for supervising our business can take drastic action if they think we are not conducting business safely or are too weak financially. They can force People\u2019s United to hold additional capital, pay higher deposit insurance premiums, stop paying dividends, stop making certain kinds of loans or stop offering certain kinds of deposits. If the agencies took any of these steps or other similar steps, it would probably make our business less profitable.\nWhile it is difficult to fully quantify the increase in our regulatory compliance burden, we do believe that costs associated with regulatory compliance will continue to increase.\nOur Ability to Declare and Pay Dividends May Be Subject to Additional Regulatory Restrictions and We May Not Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock in the Future\nPeople\u2019s United\u2019s stockholders receive dividends, as the Board of Directors may declare, out of funds legally available for such payments. Our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on our receipt of dividends from the Bank, the payment of which is subject to numerous limitations under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. In addition, as a bank holding company our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends. As a result of negative retained income (as defined) at the Bank as of December 31, 2020, and a consolidated net loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 brought about by a $353.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, both the Company and the Bank may be required to obtain the non-objection of their respective primary regulator prior to declaring and paying a dividend.\nAcquisition-Related Risk\nFailure to Complete the Merger With M&T Could Negatively Affect Our Stock Price and Our Future Business and Financial Results\nIf the pending merger with M&T is not completed for any reason, People\u2019s United\u2019s ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, People\u2019s United would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative effects on our stock price;\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from our customers and vendors;\n\u2022we will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, including legal, accounting, and other fees, whether or not the merger is completed; and\n\u2022our management team will have devoted substantial time and resources to matters relating to the merger, and would otherwise have devoted their time and resources to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to People\u2019s United.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and People\u2019s United seeks another merger or business combination, the market price of our common stock could decline, which could make it more difficult to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration M&T has agreed to provide in the merger.\nWe Will be Subject to Uncertainties While Our Merger With M&T is Pending, Which Would Adversely Affect Our Business\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving corporation following the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement May be Terminated and Our Merger With M&T May Not be Completed\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the requisite approvals of our and M&T\u2019s stockholders. Conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, we and/or M&T may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances.\nShareholder Litigation Could Prevent or Delay the Closing of Our Pending Merger With M&T or Otherwise Negatively Affect our Business and Operations\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with our pending merger with M&T. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger.\nBecause the Market Price of M&T\u2019s Common Stock May Fluctuate, Our Stockholders Cannot be Certain of the Precise Value of the Merger Consideration They May Receive In Our Proposed Merger With M&T\nAt the time our pending merger with M&T is completed, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (other than certain shares held by us or M&T) will be converted into the right to receive 0.118 shares of M&T\u2019s common stock. There will be a time lapse between each of the date of the proxy statement/prospectus for the stockholders\u2019 meeting to approve the merger, the date on which our stockholders vote to approve the merger, and the date on which our stockholders entitled to receive shares of M&T\u2019s common stock actually receive such shares. The market value of M&T\u2019s common stock may fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in M&T\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of our and M&T\u2019s control. Consequently, at the time that our stockholders must decide whether to approve the merger, they will not know the actual market value of the shares of M&T\u2019s common stock they will receive when the merger is completed. The actual value of the shares of M&T\u2019s common stock received by our shareholders will depend on the market value of shares of M&T\u2019s common stock at the time the merger is completed. This market value may be less or more than the value used to determine the exchange ratio stated in the Merger Agreement.\nGeneral\nRisks Relating to the Impact of COVID-19\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material impact on businesses around the world and the economic environments in which they operate. In March 2020, the United States declared a federal state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued to spread throughout the country. The outbreak of this virus has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries. There are a number of factors associated with the outbreak and its impact on global economies, including the United States, that have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on (among other things) the profitability, capital and liquidity of financial institutions such as People\u2019s United.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to our customers, suppliers and staff. A number of states in which we operate have implemented restrictions on the movement of their respective populations, with a resultant significant impact on economic activity in those states. The pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in many states and communities. As a result, the demand for our products and services has been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted. The circumstances around this pandemic are evolving rapidly and will likely continue to impact our business in future periods.\nIn the United States, the Federal government has taken action to provide financial support to those sectors of the economy most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The details of how these actions will impact our customers and, therefore, the impact on People\u2019s United remains uncertain at this stage. The actions taken by the U.S. government and the Federal banking regulators may indicate a view on the potential severity of a downturn and post-recovery environment, which from a commercial, regulatory and risk perspective could be significantly different to past crises and persist for a prolonged period.\nAn immediate financial impact during 2020 has been higher lifetime expected credit losses driven by a worsening of the economic scenarios used to calculate the ACL due, primarily, to a weakening in gross domestic product and employment in the United States. See Note 6, \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nShould the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause disruption to economic activity, there could be further impacts on the Company\u2019s income due to lower lending and transaction volumes and lower wealth management revenue due to volatility and weakness in the equity markets. Other potential risks include credit rating migration which could negatively impact our\nrisk-weighted assets and capital position, and potential liquidity stress due, among other factors, to increased customer drawdowns, notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the U.S. government and the Federal banking regulators have put in place to support both funding and liquidity. In addition, lower interest rates will negatively impact net interest income. Should the aforementioned economic conditions persist, the impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets could occur. Further, while the Company continues to develop its program for transitioning away from interbank offered rates, including LIBOR, the COVID-19 pandemic could affect its progress as well as the progress of other market participants.\nGovernment actions and support measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may create restrictions in relation to capital. These may limit management\u2019s flexibility in managing the business and taking action with respect to capital distribution and capital allocation. In addition, federal and state legislative and regulatory developments in response to COVID-19 may continue to impact our business and operations by, for example, requiring forbearance on loans, suspending foreclosure sales and imposing restrictions on our ability to charge certain fees. The extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments, including but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic as well as its continuing impact on our customers, vendors and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time.
