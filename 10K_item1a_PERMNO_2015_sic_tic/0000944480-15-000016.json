RISK FACTORS.\nThe following are some of the factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements made by us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. Most of these risks are generally beyond our control. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below, or any such additional risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes under Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur business is largely dependent on sales to the nuclear power industry. Any disruption in this industry would have a material adverse effect upon our revenue.\nIn 2014, 57% of our revenue was from customers in the nuclear power industry (65% in 2013). We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers in the nuclear power industry for the foreseeable future. Our ability to supply nuclear power plant simulators and related products and services is dependent on the continued operation of nuclear power plants and, to a lesser extent, on the construction of new nuclear power plants. A wide range of factors affect the continued operation and construction of nuclear power plants, including the political and regulatory environment, the availability and cost of alternative means of power generation, the occurrence of future nuclear incidents, such as the one which occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in 2011, and general economic conditions.\nOur sales to foreign customers expose us to risks associated with operating internationally.\nSales of products and services to end users outside the United States accounted for approximately 52% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2014 and 67% of consolidated revenue in 2013. Consequently, our businesses are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u00a8 export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u00a8 compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. regulations;\n\u00a8 the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n\u00a8 contract award and funding delays;\n\u00a8 potential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u00a8 potential difficulties in accounts receivable collection;\n\u00a8 currency fluctuations;\n\u00a8 import and export duties and value added taxes;\n\u00a8 transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u00a8 difficulties involving strategic alliances and managing foreign sales agents or representatives;\n\u00a8 uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n\u00a8 potential military conflicts and political risks.\nWhile we have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate. The following foreign countries have provided more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the indicated period:\nHyperspring's revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer.\nWe completed the acquisition of Hyperspring, LLC on November 14, 2014. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the following customers accounted for in excess of 10% of Hyperspring's revenues:\nHyperspring's contract for staff augmentation services with Tennessee Valley Authority expires on May 9, 2015 and such contract is expected to be rebid. Hyperspring also has a contract with PSEG Nuclear to provide training support which expires in December 2021. Hyperspring may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or is terminated by the customer prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A number of Hyperspring's other contracts with significant customers are typically subject to expiration during each year and they may lose any of these contracts if we are unable to extend, renew or renegotiate the contracts. The loss of any significant customer would adversely affect Hyperspring's revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur expense levels are based upon our expectations as to future revenue, so we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for a revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionate effect on our operating results.\nOur revenue was $37.9 million and $47.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our operating loss was $6.9 million and $10.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including purchasing patterns, timing of new products and enhancements by us and our competitors, and fluctuating global economic conditions. Since our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and includes certain fixed costs, we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and such revenue shortfalls would likely have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation.\nBacklog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Our backlog as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $48.4 million and $38.0 million, respectively. Our backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future backlog or sales. Moreover, cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of the services requested in existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, future revenues. Our failure to replace canceled or reduced backlog would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are a party to fixed price contracts and will enter into similar contracts in the future, which could result in reduced profits or losses if we are not able to accurately estimate or control costs.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to contracts entered into on a fixed price basis, which allows us to benefit from cost savings, but we carry the burden of cost overruns. If our initial estimates are incorrect, or if unanticipated circumstances arise, we could experience cost overruns which would result in reduced profits or even result in losses on these contracts. Our financial condition is dependent upon our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings or losses caused by cost overruns could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nUnder time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, which are subject to a contract ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based. However, if costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs.\nOur inability to successfully estimate and manage costs on each of these contract types may materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur Simulation business is dependent on product innovation and research and development, which costs are incurred prior to revenue for new products and improvements.\nWe believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line, develop new products, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer needs. Our product development activities are aimed at the development and expansion of our library of software modeling tools, the improvement of our display systems and workstation technologies, and the advancement and upgrading of our simulation technology. The life cycles for software modeling tools, graphical user interfaces, and simulation technology are variable and largely determined by competitive pressures. Consequently, we will need to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance and expand our capabilities in these areas and to maintain our competitive advantage.\nWe use derivative instruments in the normal course of our business which could result in financial losses that negatively impact our net income.\nWe periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign-denominated trade receivables. We could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. We attempt to minimize credit exposure by limiting counterparties to internationally recognized financial institutions.\nWe issue performance, advance payment, and bid bonds in the normal course of our business which could result in financial losses that negatively impact our net income.\nWe are often required to issue performance bonds to our customers as a normal part of our business activities. Our customers may have the ability to draw upon these performance bonds in the event we fail to cure a material breach of the contract within 30 days of receiving notice from the customer regarding the nature of the breach. As of December 31, 2014, we had issued advance payment and performance bonds on eleven contracts totaling $4.2 million, all of which have been cash collateralized except one bond totaling $48,000; the largest of these performance bonds was for $1.6 million. Although we expect no material breaches to occur on these contracts, if such a breach were to occur and we failed to cure such breach, we could incur a loss of up to $4.2 million.\nWe rely upon our intellectual property rights for the success of our business; however, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate.\nAlthough we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are important to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position, our business depends, in part, on our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology and information. We rely upon a combination of trade secret, copyright, and trademark law, contractual arrangements and technical means to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, joint venture and alliance partners, customers and other third parties that are granted access to our proprietary information, and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that we have protected or will be able to protect our proprietary technology and information adequately, that the unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary information will be prevented, that others have not or will not develop similar technology or information independently, or, to the extent we own any patents in the future, that others have not or will not be able to design around those future patents. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries in which our products are sold do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. This competition may prevent us from raising prices at the same pace at which our costs increase.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive environments with both domestic and foreign competitors, many of whom have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. The principal factors affecting competition include price, technological proficiency, ease of system configuration, product reliability, applications expertise, engineering support, local presence and financial stability. We believe competition in the simulation fields may further intensify in the future as a result of advances in technology, consolidations and/or strategic alliances among competitors, increased costs required to develop new technology and the increasing importance of software content in systems and products. As our business has a significant international component, changes in the value of the dollar could adversely affect our ability to compete internationally.\nWe may encounter difficulties in effectively integrating acquired businesses.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired companies with compatible or related products. These and any future acquisitions we make will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies, which include, among other things:\n\u00a8 potential exposure to unknown liabilities of the acquired companies;\n\u00a8 higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n\u00a8 difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies, especially if the acquired operations are geographically distant;\n\u00a8 potential disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management time and attention;\n\u00a8 failure to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful incorporation of acquired technology;\n\u00a8 difficulties in adopting and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00a8 loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management; and\n\u00a8 possible dilution to our shareholders.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any of our acquisitions.\nA failure to attract and retain technical personnel could reduce our revenue and our operational effectiveness.\nThere is a continuing demand for qualified technical personnel. We believe that our future growth and success will depend upon our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel. Our design and development efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel. An inability to attract or maintain a sufficient number of technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our contract performance or on our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.\nThe nuclear power industry, our largest customer group, is associated with a number of hazards which could create significant liabilities.\nOur business could expose us to third party claims with respect to product, environmental and other similar liabilities. Although we have sought protection from these potential liabilities through a variety of legal and contractual provisions as well as through liability insurance, the effectiveness of such protections has not been fully tested. Certain of our products and services are used by the nuclear power industry primarily in operator training. Although our contracts for such products and services typically contain provisions designed to protect us from potential liabilities associated with such use, there can be no assurance that we would not be materially adversely affected by claims or actions which may potentially arise.\nCyber security incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cyber security threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cyber security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cyber security incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nThird-party claims that we allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of others may be costly to defend or settle and could damage our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our software and services do not infringe issued patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time, including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees concerning their use of our software products and integration technologies and services. Third parties may bring claims of infringement against us. Because our software is integrated with our customers' networks and business processes, as well as other software applications, third parties may bring claims of infringement against us, as well as our customers and other software suppliers, if the cause of the alleged infringement cannot easily be determined.\nClaims of alleged infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business and may discourage potential customers from doing business with us on acceptable terms, if at all. Defending against claims of infringement may be time-consuming and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, including our management's attention to our business. Furthermore, a party making an infringement claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our software or require that we re-engineer some or all of our products. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter costly royalty or license agreements. We may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed significantly if any of these events occurred, and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we have agreed, and may agree in the future, to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our software infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others. Although we carry general liability insurance, our current insurance coverage may not apply to, and likely would not protect us from, liability that may be imposed under any of the types of claims described above.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and foreign laws, regulations and policies. Changes to laws or regulations may require us to modify our business objectives if existing practices become more restricted, subject to escalating costs or prohibited outright. Particular risks include regulatory risks arising from federal laws, such as laws regarding export of sensitive technologies or technical information. Our business and the industries in which we operate are also at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.\nOur stockholder protection rights agreement and classified Board of Directors could deter acquisition proposals and make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company, which could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nWe have a stockholder protection rights agreement and a classified Board of Directors, which could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. This deterrent could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and make it difficult to affect a change in the composition of the Board of Directors or a change in management.\nThe price of our common stock is highly volatile and could decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u00a8 changes in economic and general market conditions;\n\u00a8 changes in the outlook and financial condition of certain of our significant customers and industries in which we have a concentration of business;\n\u00a8 changes in financial estimates, treatment of our tax assets or liabilities or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business;\n\u00a8 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance or interpretations or principles;\n\u00a8 sales of common stock by our directors, officers and significant stockholders;\n\u00a8 our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts' projections; and\n\u00a8 the operating and stock price performance of competitors.\nThese factors might adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price at which you purchased it. In addition, in recent periods, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including ours and others in our industry. These changes can occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nA sustained decline in the price of our common stock or weaker than forecasted operating results could result in write-downs of goodwill and capitalized software.\nIn conjunction with business acquisitions, we record goodwill at fair value and review its fair value for impairment annually as of November 30, or on an interim basis if impairment indicators are present, such as a significant reduction in our market capitalization, significant declines in operating performance or disruptions to the business that could reduce our future cash flow. On November 14, 2014, we recorded $5.6 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of Hyperspring, LLC. We can provide no assurance that we will not have an impairment charge in future periods as the result of changing conditions. In 2013, the Company incurred a goodwill impairment of $4.5 million. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our goodwill.\nCertain computer software development costs are capitalized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is commercially available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in cost of revenue and is determined using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, typically three years. On an annual basis, and more frequently as conditions indicate, we assess the recoverability of the unamortized software development costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product. If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs we will write-down the investment to its estimated fair value based on the future undiscounted cash flows. The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related net realizable value is written down and charged to operations.\nBased upon indicators of impairment in the second quarter of 2013, which included a substantial decrease in the Company's market capitalization, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2013. In conjunction with the goodwill impairment test, we analyzed the net realizable value of our capitalized software development costs and, based upon the results of this analysis, took a $2.2 million charge to earnings for a write-down of the capitalized software development costs. After the write-down, we had $769,000 of capitalized software remaining on the balance sheet at June 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2014 we have $1.4 million of capitalized software development costs recorded on the balance sheet. See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our capitalized software development costs.", "PERMNO": 81869, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "GVP"}
