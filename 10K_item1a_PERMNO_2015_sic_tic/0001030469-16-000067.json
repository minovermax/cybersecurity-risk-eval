RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as updated by other filings the Company makes with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us at this time or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMost of our business is conducted in Puerto Rico, which in recent years has been experiencing a deep economic recession, a downturn in the real estate market, and a government fiscal and liquidity crisis.\nOur loan and deposit activities are directly affected by economic conditions within Puerto Rico. Because a significant portion of our credit risk exposure on our loan portfolio, which is the largest component of our interest-earning assets, is concentrated in Puerto Rico, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected by an extended economic recession, adverse political, fiscal or economic developments in Puerto Rico, or the effects of a natural disaster, all of which could result in a reduction in loan originations, an increase in non-performing assets, an increase in foreclosure losses on mortgage loans, and a reduction in the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio.\nThe Puerto Rico economy has been in a recession since 2006 and the Commonwealth government currently faces a severe fiscal and liquidity crisis as a result of many years of significant budget deficits, among other factors, which have adversely affected its ability to obtain financing at reasonable interest rates, if at all. Puerto Rico also faces high unemployment, unprecedented population decline, and high levels of government debt and pension obligations. A further deterioration in local economic conditions or in the financial condition of an industry on which the local market depends could adversely affect factors such as unemployment rates and real estate vacancy and values. This could result in, among other things, a reduction of creditworthy borrowers seeking loans, an increase in loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, an increase in classified and non-accrual loans, a decrease in the value of collateral for or loans, and a decrease in core deposits. Any of these factors could materially impact our business.\nFor a discussion of the impact of the economy on our loan portfolios, see \u201c-A prolonged economic downturn or recession or a continuing decline in the real estate market would likely result in an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction in loan origination activity, which would adversely affect our financial results.\u201d\nWe are exposed to credit and concentration risk in connection with our loans to certain public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities of Puerto Rico, and a credit default on their debt obligations could adversely affect the value of such loans and our financial condition.\nAlthough the economy of Puerto Rico is closely related to the economy of the rest of the United States, the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities face a number of severe economic and fiscal challenges that, either individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to pay debt-service on its obligations when due. The three main credit rating agencies have downgraded all debt obligations of the Puerto Rico government to categories that are well below investment grade and a credit or payment default by at least two of the Commonwealth\u2019s public instrumentalities has occurred and additional defaults are generally expected. The downgrades are based mostly on concerns about Puerto Rico\u2019s economic recession, liquidity availability, sizable debt-obligations, high unemployment, shrinking population, unreliable forecasts for financial information, and the Puerto Rico government\u2019s lack of financial flexibility and limited capacity to borrow in the capital markets, which increase the Commonwealth\u2019s risk of default. Securities that are below investment grade present greater risks and are less liquid than investment-grade securities.\nThe Commonwealth government has unveiled a fiscal restructuring plan that, among other findings, provides that paying debt service on Puerto Rico\u2019s government obligations in the face of significant financing gaps could severely impair its ability to provide essential services to the residents of Puerto Rico. In this regard, it has proposed to seek a consensual restructuring of its outstanding debt and other tax-supported obligations. If the government is unable to restructure its debts and/or negotiate upcoming maturities and liquidity sources continue scarce, the government may have to declare a debt-service moratorium, default on its debt obligations, eliminate government agencies, cut essential programs or services, and take other emergency or extraordinary actions. Any further deterioration of economic or fiscal conditions in Puerto Rico could adversely affect the value of our loans to the government of Puerto Rico and the value of our investment portfolio of Puerto Rico government bonds.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $415 million of credit facilities granted to the Puerto Rico government, including its instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities, all of which was outstanding as of such date. A substantial portion of our\ncredit exposure to the government of Puerto Rico consists of collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues identified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\u201cPREPA\u201d). Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the central government and many have received appropriations or are due other payments from it.\nOriental Bank is part of a four bank syndicate providing a $550 million revolving line of credit to finance the purchase of fuel for PREPA\u2019s day-to-day power generation activities. Our participation in the line of credit has an unpaid principal balance of $190.3 million as of December 31, 2015. As part of the bank syndicate, the Bank entered into a forbearance agreement with PREPA, which was extended several times until the execution of a Restructuring Support Agreement on November 5, 2015 with PREPA and certain other creditors. The Restructuring Support Agreement provides for the restructuring of the fuel line of credit subject to the accomplishment of several milestones, including some milestones that depend on the actions of third parties to the agreement, such as the negotiation of agreements with other creditors and legislative action. The Company has classified the credit facility to PREPA as substandard and on non-accrual status. The Company conducted an impairment analysis considering the probability of collection of principal and interest, which included a financial model to project the future liquidity status of PREPA under various scenarios and its capacity to service its financial obligations, and concluded that PREPA had sufficient cash flows for the repayment of the line of credit. Despite the Company\u2019s analysis showing PREPA\u2019s capacity to repay the line of credit, the Company placed its participation in non-accrual during the first quarter of 2015 and recorded a $53.3 million provision for loan and lease losses during 2015. Since April 1, 2015, interest payments have been applied to principal.\nIn June 2014, Puerto Rico enacted the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act (the \u201cRecovery Act\u201d), which established procedures for the adjustment of debts of certain public corporations owned by the Commonwealth, which, as Puerto Rico governmental instrumentalities, are not currently eligible for federal bankruptcy relief under any chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Recovery Act states in its preamble that it further promotes the government\u2019s public policy of no longer providing financial support to such public corporations, such as, for example, the PREPA, and promoting their economic independence. In February 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico held that the Recovery Act is preempted by the U.S Bankruptcy Code and is therefore void pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. It also permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing the Recovery Act. The District Court\u2019s decision was upheld on appeal by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. However, on December 4, 2015, the United States Supreme Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to review the District Court\u2019s decision. Oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court are scheduled for March 22, 2016. In addition, there are ongoing initiatives in Congress to make Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code applicable to Puerto Rico and/or otherwise provide an orderly debt restructuring regime for the Commonwealth. In summary, the Commonwealth\u2019s current ability to restructure the debts of some of its public corporations, such as PREPA, remains uncertain, and a broad disorderly restructuring with multiple creditor lawsuits and other legal actions\nis possible.\nPREPA\u2019s enabling act provides for local receivership upon request to any Puerto Rico court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a default in debt-service payments or other obligations in connection with PREPA\u2019s bonds. The receiver so appointed would be empowered, directly or through its agents and attorneys, to take possession of the undertakings, income and revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds in default; to have, hold, use, operate, manage and control the same; and to exercise all of PREPA\u2019s rights and powers with respect to such undertakings. However, any such receiver would not have the power to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of PREPA\u2019s assets, and its powers would be limited to the operation and maintenance of such undertakings and the collection and application of the income and revenues therefrom. These provisions have not been tested in the courts, and it is not clear if and how they would apply in connection with other debts and obligations of PREPA upon an event of default.\nThe PREPA Revitalization Act was recently signed into law by the Governor of Puerto Rico. It provides for a major debt restructuring of PREPA\u2019s outstanding debt and sets forth a legal framework for PREPA to execute on the agreements reached with its creditors. Among other things, it (i) enhances PREPA\u2019s governance processes; (ii) adjusts PREPA\u2019s practices for hiring and managing personnel; (iii) changes PREPA\u2019s processes for collecting outstanding bills from public and private entities; (iv) improves transparency of PREPA\u2019s billing practices; (v) implements a competitive bidding process for soliciting third party investment in PREPA\u2019s infrastructure; (vi) allows for the refinancing of existing PREPA bonds through a securitization that would reduce PREPA\u2019s indebtedness and cost of borrowing; and (vii) sets forth a process for the Energy Commission to address PREPA\u2019s proposal for a new rate structure that consistent with its recovery plan.\nIf our Commonwealth public debtors are unable to pay their obligations to us as they become due, or under certain other circumstances, we may be required to adversely classify such loans and provision for losses in connection therewith. Such provision may significantly impact our financial condition and our regulatory capital ratios.\nOur decisions regarding credit risk and the allowance for loan and lease losses may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMaking loans is an essential element of our business, and there is a risk that the loans will not be repaid. This default risk is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the duration of the loan;\n\u00b7 credit risks of a particular borrower;\n\u00b7 changes in economic or industry conditions; and\n\u00b7 in the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nOur customers might not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans might be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nOur emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for loan losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings.\nWe strive to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We periodically determine the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors such as default frequency, internal risk ratings, expected future cash collections, loss recovery rates and general economic factors, among others. Our methodology for measuring the adequacy of the allowance relies on several key elements, which include a specific allowance for identified problem loans and a general systematic allowance.\nWe believe our allowance for loan and lease losses is currently sufficient given the constant monitoring of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio. However, there is no precise method of predicting loan losses and therefore we always face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses and that additional increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses will be required. In addition, the FDIC as well as the OCFI may require us to establish additional reserves. Additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would result in a decrease of net earnings and capital, and could hinder our ability to pay dividends.\nGiven the severe economic conditions in Puerto Rico, we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take greater than anticipated markdowns and make greater than anticipated provisions to increase the allowances for loan losses on the loans acquired that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nBank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nNon-Compliance with USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nFinancial Institutions are required under the USA Patriot Act and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement actions, fines or\npenalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators or costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. We have developed policies and continue to augment procedures, staff and systems designed to assist in compliance with such laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to default and other risks in connection with mortgage loan originations.\nFrom the time that we fund the mortgage loans originated to the time that they are sold, we are generally at risk for any mortgage loan defaults. Once we sell the mortgage loans, the risk of loss from mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures passes to the purchaser or insurer of the mortgage loans. However, in the ordinary course of business, we make representations and warranties to the purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans relating to the validity of such loans. If there is a breach of any of these representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan. We also may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased $26.6 million of loans from GNMA and FNMA. Any such repurchases in the future may negatively impact our liquidity and operating results. Termination of our ability to sell mortgage products to the U.S government-sponsored entities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances, including securities fraud claims, and the amount of such losses could exceed the purchase amount of the related loans. Consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans. In addition, we incur higher liquidity risk with respect to mortgage loans not eligible to be purchased or insured by FNMA, GNMA or FHLMC, due to a lack of secondary market in which to sell these loans.\nWe have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by us. The adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on, among other things, the actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rate of claimants, developments in litigation related to us and the industry, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). Due to uncertainties relating to these factors, there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. For additional information related to our allowance for loan and lease losses, see \u201cNote 6-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nA prolonged economic downturn or recession or a continuing decline in the real estate market would likely result in an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction in loan origination activity, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nThe residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of lower volumes and industry-wide losses. The market for residential mortgage loan originations in Puerto Rico is currently in decline, and this trend could also reduce the level of mortgage loans that we may originate in the future and may adversely impact our business. During periods of rising interest rates, refinancing originations for many mortgage products tend to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values. A significant trend of decreasing values in several housing segments in Puerto Rico has also been noted. There is a risk that a reduction in housing values could negatively impact our loss levels on the mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homes underlying the loans is a primary source of repayment in the event of foreclosure.\nThe decline in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has had an adverse effect in the credit quality of our loan portfolios. Among other things, during the ongoing recession, we have experienced an increase in the level of non-performing assets and loan loss provision, which adversely affected our profitability. Although the delinquency rates have decreased recently, they may increase if the recession continues or worsen. If there is another decline in economic activity, additional increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could be necessary with further adverse effects on our profitability.\nAny sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm our ability to sell loans, the price received on the sale of such loans, and the value of the mortgage loan portfolio, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations\nand financial condition. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken our collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. For a discussion of the impact of the Puerto Rico economy on our business operations, see \u201cMost of our business is conducted in Puerto Rico, which is experiencing a deep economic recession, downturn in the real estate market, and a government fiscal and liquidity crisis.\u201d\nWe are subject to security and operational risk related to our use of technology, including the risk of cyber-attack or cyber theft\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks regarding our customers and their accounts. To provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate. As a financial institution, we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs.\nSuch incidents may include unauthorized access to our digital systems for purposes of misappropriation of assets, gaining access to sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Although our information technology structure continue to be subject to cyber attacks, we have not experience a breach of cyber-security. Such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our customers and third parties with whom we interact with and may result in negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenues, additional regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reputational damage. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designated to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of our information systems, if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to confidential or proprietary information in our possession or to our proprietary information, it could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems that could adversely affect our business. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nWe rely on the services of third parties for our banking, information technology, telecommunications, and mortgage loan servicing infrastructure, and any failure, interruption or termination of such services or systems could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies on the secure, successful and uninterrupted functioning of our banking, information technology, telecommunications, and mortgage loan servicing infrastructure. We outsource some of our major systems, such as customer data and deposit processing, mortgage loan servicing, Internet and mobile banking, and electronic fund transfer systems. The failure or interruption of such systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or mortgage servicing, or any service agreement on which any of these systems or services is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such systems fail or experience interruptions.\nWe periodically sell or securitize our mortgage loans while retaining the obligation to perform the servicing of such loans. Although we are the master servicer of our mortgage loan portfolios, we outsource our servicing functions pursuant to a subservicing arrangement with a third party in Puerto Rico. The termination or interruption of such subservicing arrangement, without a feasible substitute or successor, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because the FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan and lease losses if the shared-loss agreements are not performed by us in accordance with their terms, any such termination or interruption of the subservicing of the covered loans that we acquired in the FDIC-assisted acquisition could adversely affect our ability to comply with such terms.\nIf sustained or repeated, a failure, denial or termination of such systems or services could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new loans, service existing loans, gather deposits and/or provide customer service. It could also compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results are constantly exposed to market risk, in particular to changes in interest rates.\nMarket risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the fair value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or equity prices.\nChanges in interest rates are one of the principal market risks affecting us. Our income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on interest-earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics of the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature or reprice in that period.\nWe use an asset-liability management software program to project future movements in the balance sheet and income statement. The starting point of the projections generally corresponds to the actual values of the balance sheet on the date of the simulations. These simulations are highly complex and use many simplifying assumptions. In addition, the interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the value of loans and investment securities, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:\n\u00b7 Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example, if assets reprice slower than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings may initially decline.\n\u00b7 Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is rising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less than the general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricing competition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similar repricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices that may not move in tandem.\n\u00b7 Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts, i.e., the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently.\n\u00b7 The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, our mortgage-backed securities portfolios may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce portfolio income. If prepayment rates increase, we would be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has a significant impact on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these portfolios.\n\u00b7 Interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand, credit losses, loan origination volume, the value of financial assets and financial liabilities, gains and losses on sales of securities and loans, the value of mortgage servicing rights and other sources of earnings.\nIn limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. We may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated in initial projections as management implements strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.\nThe hedging transactions that we enter into may not be effective in managing our exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.\nWe use over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and options on interest rate swaps, to manage part of our exposure to market risk caused by changes in interest rates. We have offered certificates of deposit with an option tied to the performance of the Standard & Poor 500 stock market index and use derivatives, such as option agreements with major broker-dealer companies, to manage our exposure to changes in the value of the index. The OTC derivative instruments that we may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (i) basis risk, which is the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost; (ii) credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder; and (iii) legal risk, which is the risk that we are unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. All or any of such risks could expose us to losses. Further, as a result of the new regulatory regime\nfor OTC derivatives enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the regulations issued thereunder by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we are subject to additional reporting, recordkeeping and other requirements in connection with our use of OTC derivatives.\nIf the counterparty to an OTC derivative contract fails to perform, our credit risk is equal to the net fair value of the contract. We deal with counterparties that have high quality credit ratings at the time we enter into the counterparty relationships. However, there can be no assurances that the counterparties will have the ability to perform under their contracts. If the counterparty fails to perform, including as a result of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such counterparty, we would incur losses as a result.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we cannot maintain access to stable funding sources.\nOur business requires continuous access to various funding sources. We are able to fund our operations through deposits as well as through advances from the FHLB-NY and FRB-NY; however, our business is significantly dependent upon other wholesale funding sources, such as repurchase agreements and brokered deposits, which consisted of approximately 23% of our total interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2015.\nBrokered deposits are typically sold through an intermediary to small retail investors. Our ability to continue to attract brokered deposits is subject to variability based upon a number of factors, including volume and volatility in the global securities markets, our credit rating and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. Brokered deposits are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches. Investors in brokered deposits are generally more sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on small differences in interest rates offered on deposits.\nWe expect to have continued access to credit from the foregoing sources of funds. However, there can be no assurance that such financing sources will continue to be available or will be available on favorable terms. In a period of financial disruption, or if negative developments occur with respect to us, the availability and cost of funding sources could be adversely affected. In that event, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing the net interest income, or we may need to dispose of a portion of the investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in realizing a loss or experiencing other adverse accounting consequences upon the dispositions. The interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other reductions in liquidity driven by us or market related events. In the event that such sources of funds are reduced or eliminated and we are not able to replace them on a cost-effective basis, we may be forced to curtail or cease our loan origination business and treasury activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur risk management policies, procedures and systems may be inadequate to mitigate all risks inherent in our various businesses.\nA comprehensive risk management function is essential to the financial and operational success of our business. The types of risk we monitor and seek to manage include, but are not limited to, operational risk, technological and organizational risk, market risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted various policies, procedures and systems to monitor and manage these risks. There can be no assurance that those policies, procedures and systems are adequate to identify and mitigate all risks inherent in our various businesses. Our businesses and the markets in which we operate are also continuously evolving. If we fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our business or the financial markets and to adequately or timely enhance the risk framework to address those changes, we could incur losses. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, our risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for us to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits and assets to manage. The competition in originating loans and attracting assets comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and foreign banks, investment advisors, securities broker-dealers, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. We will encounter greater competition as we expand our operations. Increased competition may require us to increase the rates paid on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes, as discussed under the subheading \u201cDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\u201d in Item 1of this annual report.\nThe changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. In particular, the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively, include, among others:\n\u00b7 a reduction in our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets as a result of compliance with heightened capital standards;\n\u00b7 increased cost of operations due to greater regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks and bank holding companies, and higher deposit insurance premiums;\n\u00b7 the limitation on our ability to raise capital through the use of trust preferred securities as these securities will no longer be included as tier 1 capital going forward; and\n\u00b7 the limitation on our ability to expand consumer product and service offerings due to stricter consumer protection laws and regulations.\nFurther, we may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.\nLegislative and other measures that may be taken by Puerto Rico governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn an effort to address the Commonwealth\u2019s ongoing fiscal problems, the Government has enacted tax reform in the past and is expected to do so in the future. In 2014, the Government of Puerto Rico approved an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code, which, among other things, changed the income tax rate for capital gains from 15% to 20%. In addition, in May 2015, the Government approved an increase in the state sales and use tax rate, effective July 1, 2015, from 6% to 10.5% (the municipal sales and use tax remained at a 1% rate), expanded the sales and use tax to certain business-to-business services that were previously exempt, and provided for a transition to a value-added tax was expected to become effective on April 1, 2016. Now, the value added tax is expected to become effective on June 1, 2016. Legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe operate the IBE Unit and IBE Subsidiary pursuant to the IBE Act that provide us with significant tax advantages. An IBE has the benefits of exemptions from Puerto Rico income taxes on interest earned on, or gain realized from the sale of, non-Puerto Rico assets, including U.S. government obligations and certain mortgage-backed securities. This exemption has allowed us to have effective tax rates significantly below the maximum statutory tax rates. In the past, the Legislature of Puerto Rico has considered proposals to curb the tax benefits afforded to IBEs. In 2012, a new Puerto Rico law was enacted in this area. Although it did not repeal the IBE Act, the new law does not allow new license applications under the IBE Act to organize and operate an IBE. Any newly organized entity (now called an \u201cinternational financial entity\u201d) must be licensed under the new law and such entity (as opposed to existing IBEs organized under the IBE Act, including the Bank\u2019s IBE Unit and IBE Subsidiary, which are \u201cgrandfathered\u201d) will generally be subject to a 4% Puerto Rico income tax rate. In the event other legislation is passed in Puerto Rico to eliminate or modify the tax exemption enjoyed by IBEs, the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on us, including increasing the tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets could be determined to be impaired in the future and could decrease the Company\u2019s earnings.\nWe are required to test our goodwill, core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common shares or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly restrict the Company\u2019s ability to make dividend payments without prior regulatory approval.\nBased on our annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that no impairment charges were necessary. As of December 31, 2015, we had on our consolidated balance sheet $86.1 million of goodwill in connection with the BBVAPR Acquisition and the FDIC-assisted Eurobank acquisition, $5.3 million of core deposit intangible in connection with the FDIC-assisted Eurobank acquisition and the BBVAPR Acquisition, and $2.5 million of customer relationship intangible in connection with the BBVAPR Acquisition. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of such goodwill or intangibles will not result in any impairment charges. Among other factors, further declines in our common stock as a result of macroeconomic conditions and the general weakness of the Puerto Rico economy, could lead to an impairment of such assets. If such assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. Dividends to us from our subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations. There are various U.S. federal and Puerto Rico law limitations on the extent to which Oriental Bank, our main subsidiary, can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, U.S. federal and Puerto Rico banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. Further, under the new capital rules adopted by the federal banking regulatory agencies, a banking organization will need to hold a capital conservation buffer (composed of common equity tier 1 capital) greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Compliance with the capital conservation buffer is determined as of the end of the calendar quarter prior to any such capital distribution or discretionary bonus payment, and is subject to a three-year transition period beginning in 2016.\nIf our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments while maintaining adequate capital levels, our liquidity may be affected, and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our holders of common and preferred stock or payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or perception of financial health.\nIn addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by FASB. Market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to promulgate new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. See \u201cNote 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of any accounting developments that have been issued but not yet implemented. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, the effects on our consolidated financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that applies to the consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in attracting talented people could adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations. Our success to date has been influenced strongly by the ability to attract and retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services. Retention of senior managers and appropriate succession planning will continue to be critical to the successful implementation of our strategies.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate loans and to attract deposits and assets is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer, commercial and funding markets of our business practices and our financial health. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, inadequate protection of customer information, or sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators in response to such conduct. Adverse perceptions regarding us could lead to difficulties in originating loans and generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them.\nIn addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if consumption trends decline, our business and financial results will be negatively affected.", "PERMNO": 11208, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OFG"}
