{"cik": "1455684", "company": "TPI COMPOSITES, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, growth prospects and cash flows could suffer significantly. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Wind Blade Business\nA significant portion of our business is derived from a small number of customers, and two wind blade customers in particular, therefore any loss of or reduction in purchase orders, failure of these customers to fulfill their obligations or our failure to secure long-term supply agreement renewals from these customers could materially harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from four wind blade customers. Two customers, Vestas and GE Wind, accounted for 49.7% and 23.4%, respectively, of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 46.1% and 25.7%, respectively, of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 32.0% and 31.7%, respectively, of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, two customers, Nordex and Siemens Gamesa accounted for 15.3% and 4.7%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, 16.1% and 5.1%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 19.0% and 11.2%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. Accordingly, we are substantially dependent on continued business from our current wind blade customers, and Vestas and GE Wind in particular. If one or more of our wind blade customers were to reduce or delay wind blade orders, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, fail to pay amounts due or satisfactorily perform their respective contractual obligations with us or otherwise terminate or fail to renew their long-term supply agreements with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nDefects in materials and workmanship or wind blade failures could harm our reputation, expose us to product warranty or other liability claims, decrease demand for wind blades we manufacture, or materially harm existing or prospective customer relationships, and our reserves for warranty expenses might not be sufficient to cover all future costs.\nDefects in the wind blades we manufacture are unpredictable and an inherent risk in manufacturing technically advanced products that involve a significant amount of manual labor and processes. Defects may arise from multiple causes, including design, engineering, materials, manufacturing and components failures as well as deficiencies in our manufacturing processes. Under our supply agreements, we warranty the materials and workmanship of the wind blades while our customers are responsible for the fitness of use and design of the wind blades. We have experienced wind blade failures and defects at some of our facilities during the startup manufacturing phase of new products, and we may experience failures or defects in the future. Wind blades that we have manufactured have also failed in the field. Any wind blade failures or other product defects in the future could materially harm our existing and prospective customer relationships. Specifically, negative publicity about the quality of the wind blades we manufacture or defects in the wind blades supplied to our customers could result in a reduction in wind blade orders, increased warranty claims, product liability claims and other damages or termination of our long-term supply agreements or business relationships with current or new customers. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe provide warranties for all of the wind blades and precision molding and assembly systems we produce, including parts and labor, for periods that typically range from two to five years depending on the product sold. Our estimate of warranty expense requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain, including future rates of product failure, repair costs, shipping and handling and de-installation and re-installation costs at customers\u2019 sites. Our assumptions could be materially different from the actual performance of our products and these remediation expenses in the future. The expenses associated with wind blade repair and remediation activities can be substantial and may include changes to our manufacturing processes. If our estimates prove materially incorrect, we could incur warranty expenses that exceed our reserves and be required to make material unplanned cash expenditures, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by changing customer demands and associated transition costs, which could materially harm our business.\nThe wind energy industry is competitive and is characterized by evolving customer demands. As a result, we must adapt quickly to customer requests for changes to wind blade specifications, which increases our costs and can provide periods of reduced revenue and margins. For instance, during 2020 and into 2021, we have undertaken and will undertake model transitions at several of our facilities for various customer demands. In 2020, we had several manufacturing lines in transition which adversely impacted our revenue and profitability. We currently expect to have manufacturing lines in transition during 2021 which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability in 2021. We typically share transition costs with the customer in connection with these changing customer demands, but any sharing is usually the subject of negotiation and the amount is not always contractually defined. If we do not receive transition payments from our customers sufficient to cover our transition costs or lost margins, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nWe have experienced, and could in the future experience, quality or operational issues in connection with plant construction or expansion, which could result in losses and cause delays in our ability to complete our projects and may therefore materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe dedicate most of the capacity of our current wind blade manufacturing facilities to existing customers and, as a result, we may need to build additional manufacturing capacity or facilities to serve the needs of new customers or expanded needs of existing customers. Since the third quarter of 2016, we have commenced operations at four new manufacturing facilities in Mexico, one in Turkey, one in Yangzhou, China and one in Chennai, India. The construction of new plants and the expansion of existing plants involves significant time, cost and other risks. We generally expect our plants to generate losses in their first 12 to 18 months of operations related to production startup costs. Additionally, numerous factors can contribute, and have in the past contributed, to delays or difficulties in the startup of, or the adoption of our manufacturing lines to produce larger wind blade models, which we refer to as model transitions, in our manufacturing facilities. These factors include permitting, construction or renovation delays, defects or issues with product tooling, the engineering and fabrication of specialized equipment, the modification of our general production know-how and customer-specific manufacturing processes to address the specific wind blades to be tested and built, changing and evolving customer specifications and expectations and the hiring and training of plant personnel. Any delays or difficulties in plant startup or expansion may result in cost overruns, production delays, contractual penalties, loss of revenues, reduced margins and impairment of customer relationships, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2019, we experienced construction and startup delays with respect to our new manufacturing facility in Yangzhou, China. These delays resulted in us paying liquidated damages of $7.8 million to one of our customers in 2019 and 2020.\nSome of our long-term supply agreements with our customers are subject to early termination and volume reductions at the discretion of our customers, and any early termination of or reduced volumes of wind blades purchased under these agreements could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current long-term supply agreements expire between the end of 2021 and the end of 2024. Some of our long-term supply agreements contain provisions that allow for the early termination of these agreements upon the customer providing us with advance written notice and paying an early termination fee. Our wind blade supply agreements generally establish annual purchase requirements on which we rely for our future production and financial forecasts. However, the timing and volume of purchases, within certain parameters, may be subject to change by our customers. The amount of the annual purchase requirements typically decline in the later years of our long-term supply agreements. Our customers may not continue to maintain long-term supply agreements with us in the future. For example, Vestas has notified us that it does not intend to renew our Dafeng, China supply agreement, which expires at the end of 2021. If one or more of our customers terminate, or reduce the number of manufacturing lines and volumes of wind blades purchased, or fail to renew their long-term supply agreements with us, it would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our long-term supply agreements contain liquidated damages provisions, which may require us to make unanticipated payments to our customers.\nMany of our long-term supply agreements contain liquidated damages provisions in the event that we fail to perform our obligations thereunder in a timely manner or in accordance with the agreed terms, conditions and standards. Our liquidated damages provisions generally require us to make a payment to the customer if we fail to deliver a product or service on time. We generally try to limit our exposure under any individual long-term supply agreement to a maximum penalty. Nevertheless, if we incur liquidated damages, they may materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur wind turbine OEM customers are facing increasing competition and pricing pressure due to the increasing prevalence of auction-based tenders in wind energy markets, and correspondingly our margins and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMany governments are shifting from feed-in tariffs, which typically provide producers of wind energy with favorable prices for wind generated electricity, to unsubsidized, auction-based tenders as a means of promoting the development and growth of renewable energy sources such as wind energy. As a result of this shift, our wind turbine OEM customers are experiencing intense pricing pressure with respect to the sale of their turbines. As a result of this pricing pressure, we will be required to further reduce the costs we incur to manufacture wind blades to remain competitive. We typically share the benefit of cost reductions related to manufacturing wind blades with our customers pursuant to the terms of our long-term supply agreements. If these pricing pressures continue, we may choose to reduce our margins or pass on a greater percentage of the savings to our OEM customers obtained from manufacturing cost reductions than required under our supply agreements to remain competitive, each of which may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough a majority of our manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States, our business is still heavily dependent upon the demand for wind energy in the United States and any downturn in demand for wind energy in the United States could materially harm our business.\nWe have developed a global footprint to serve the growing wind energy market worldwide and have wind blade manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, Mexico, Turkey and India. Although a majority of our manufacturing facilities are located outside of the United States, historically more than half of the wind blades that we produced were deployed in wind farms located within the United States. Our Iowa and Mexico manufacturing facilities manufacture wind blades that are generally deployed within the United States. In addition, many of our wind blades are exported from our China, Turkey and India manufacturing facilities to the United States. In addition, tariffs imposed on components of wind turbines from China, including wind blades, has had a negative impact on demand for our wind blades manufactured in our Chinese manufacturing facilities. Consequently, demand for wind energy and our wind blade sales could be adversely affected by a variety of reasons and factors, and any downturn in demand for wind energy in the United States could materially harm our business.\nWe could experience shortages of raw materials or components critical to our manufacturing needs, which may hinder our ability to perform under our supply agreements.\nWe rely upon third parties for raw materials, such as fiberglass, carbon, resins, foam core and balsa wood, and various components for the wind blades we manufacture. Some of these raw materials and components may only be purchased from a limited number of suppliers. For example, balsa wood is only grown and produced in a limited number of geographies and is only available from a limited number of suppliers. Additionally, our ability to purchase the appropriate quantities of raw materials is constrained by our customers\u2019 transitioning wind blade designs and specifications. As a result, we maintain relatively low inventory and acquire raw materials and components as needed. Due to significant international demand for these raw materials from many industries, we may be unable to acquire sufficient quantities or secure a stable supply for our manufacturing needs. For example, in 2019, we experienced shortages in the supply of balsa wood and other core materials. If shortages or delays occur, we may be unable to provide our products to our customers on time, or at all. In some instances, our customers directly control the purchase of certain key raw materials and components and if they are unable to procure and provide us with such raw materials and components, it could cause delays and disruptions with respect to our business and operations. In 2020, we procured approximately 25% of our raw materials from China so any weather events, strikes, other force majeure events or geopolitical developments impacting China could disrupt our supply chain. In addition, a disruption in any aspect of our global supply chain caused by transportation delays, customs\ndelays, cost issues or other factors could result in a shortage of raw materials or components critical to our manufacturing needs. For example, in 2020 and 2021, we have experienced several delays in receipt of certain raw materials used to make our products primarily due to COVID-19 outbreaks amongst port workers at certain ports in the United States. Any supply shortages, delays in the shipment of materials or components from third party suppliers, or changes in the terms on which they are available could disrupt or materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDemand for the wind blades we manufacture may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including the growth of the wind industry, and decreases in demand could materially harm our business and may not be sufficient to support our growth strategy.\nOur revenues, business prospects and growth strategy heavily depend on the continued growth of the wind industry and our customers\u2019 continuing demand for wind blades. Customer demand could decrease from anticipated levels due to numerous factors outside of our control that may affect the development of the wind energy market generally, portions of the market or individual wind project developments, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe general availability and demand for electricity;\n\u2022\nwind energy market volatility;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness, availability and reliability of alternative sources of energy and competing methods of producing electricity, including solar and non-renewable sources such as natural gas;\n\u2022\nforeign, federal and state governmental tariffs, subsidies and tax or regulatory policies;\n\u2022\ndelays or cancellations of government tenders or auctions for wind energy projects;\n\u2022\nthe availability of financing for wind development projects;\n\u2022\nthe development of electrical transmission infrastructure and the ability to implement a proper grid connection for wind development projects;\n\u2022\nforeign, federal and state laws and regulations regarding avian protection plans, noise or turbine setback requirements and other environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 cost of transporting wind blades from our manufacturing facilities to wind farms;\n\u2022\nincreases in the price or lack of availability of raw materials used to produce our wind blades;\n\u2022\nadministrative and legal challenges to proposed wind development projects; and\n\u2022\npublic perception and localized community responses to wind energy projects.\nIn addition to factors affecting the wind energy market generally, our customers\u2019 demand may also fluctuate based on other factors beyond our control. Any decline in customer demand below anticipated levels could materially harm our revenues and operating results and could delay or impede our growth strategy.\nWe have experienced in the past, and our future wind blade production could be affected by, operating problems at our facilities, which may materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur wind blade manufacturing processes and production capacity have in the past been, and could in the future be, disrupted by a variety of issues, including:\n\u2022\nproduction outages to conduct maintenance activities that cannot be performed safely during operations;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures or reductions;\n\u2022\nbreakdowns, failures or substandard performance of machinery and equipment;\n\u2022\nour inability to comply with material environmental requirements or permits;\n\u2022\ninadequate transportation infrastructure, including problems with railroad tracks, bridges, tunnels or roads;\n\u2022\nsupply shortages of key raw materials and components;\n\u2022\ndamage or production delays caused by earthquakes, fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, extreme weather conditions such as windstorms, hailstorms, drought, temperature extremes, typhoons or other natural disasters or terrorism or health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nlabor unrest or shortages in skilled labor.\nThe cost of repeated or prolonged interruptions, reductions in production capacity, or the repair or replacement of complex and sophisticated tooling and equipment may be considerable and could result in damages under or the termination of our long-term supply agreements or penalties for regulatory non-compliance, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate a substantial portion of our business in international markets and we may be unable to effectively manage a variety of currency, legal, regulatory, economic, social and political risks associated with our global operations and those in developing markets.\nWe currently operate manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, Mexico, Turkey, and India. Since the third quarter of 2016, we have commenced operations at four new manufacturing facilities in Mexico, one in Turkey, one in Yangzhou, China and one in Chennai, India. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 89%, 88% and 84%, respectively, of our net sales were derived from our international operations and we expect that a substantial portion of our projected revenue growth will be derived from those operations. Our overall success depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. The global nature of our operations is subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multiple international locations;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk or currency exchange controls imposed by foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe risk of import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs on foreign trade and investment, including boycotts and embargoes;\n\u2022\ntaxation and revenue policies or other restrictions, including royalty and tax increases, retroactive tax claims and the imposition of unexpected taxes;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of, or rapid or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws, regulatory requirements or trade policies;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital or transfers of funds into or out of foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlimited protection for intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate insurance;\n\u2022\ndifficulty administering internal controls and legal and compliance practices in countries with different cultural norms and business practices;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of being subjected to the jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe misinterpretation of local contractual terms, renegotiation or modification of existing long-term supply agreements and enforcement of contractual terms in disputes before local courts;\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain or enforce legal rights and remedies at a reasonable cost or at all; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for political unrest, expropriation, nationalization, revolution, war or acts of terrorism in countries in which we operate.\nAs we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. We may be unsuccessful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country where we do business or conduct operations. Our failure to manage these risks successfully could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not achieve the long-term growth we anticipate if wind turbine OEMs do not continue to shift from in-house production of wind blades to outsourced wind blade suppliers and if we do not expand our customer relationships and add new customers.\nMany wind turbine OEMs rely on in-house production of wind blades for some or all of their wind turbines. Our growth strategy depends in large part on the continued expansion of our relationships with our current wind blade customers, and the addition of new key customers. All of our customers possess the financial, engineering and technical capabilities to produce their own wind blades and many source wind blades from multiple suppliers. Our existing customers may not expand their wind energy operations or, if they do, they may not choose us to supply them with new or additional quantities of wind blades. Our collaborative dedicated supplier model for the manufacture of wind blades is a significant departure from traditional vertically integrated methods. As is typical for rapidly evolving industries, customer demand for new business models is highly uncertain. Although we have entered into long-term supply agreements with customers that also produce wind blades for their wind turbines in-house, we may not be able to maintain these customer relationships or enter into similar arrangements with new customers that produce wind blades in-house in the future. In addition, although GE Wind historically outsourced all of their wind blade production requirements prior to its acquisition of LM, we expect that GE Wind will continue to utilize LM for a substantial percentage of its wind blade production in the future. Our business and growth strategies depend in large part on the continuation of the trend toward outsourcing manufacturing. If that trend does not continue or we are unsuccessful in persuading wind turbine OEMs to shift from in-house production to the outsourcing of their wind blade manufacturing, we may not achieve the long-term growth we anticipate and our market share could be limited.\nA drop in the price of energy sources other than wind energy, or our inability to deliver wind blades that compete with the price of other energy sources, may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that the decision to purchase wind energy is, to a significant degree, driven by the relative cost of electricity generated by wind turbines compared to the applicable price of electricity from traditional (i.e. thermal) and other renewable energy sources. Decreases in the prices of electricity from traditional or renewable energy sources other than wind energy, such as solar, would harm the market for wind energy. In particular, a drop in natural gas prices could lessen the appeal of wind-generated electricity. Technological advancements or the construction of a significant number of power generation plants, including nuclear, coal, natural gas or power plants utilizing other renewable energy technologies, government support for other forms of renewable energy or construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines could reduce the price of electricity produced by competing methods, thereby making the purchase of wind energy less attractive. The ability of energy conservation technologies, public initiatives and government incentives to reduce electricity consumption or support other forms of renewable energy could also lead to a reduction in the price of electricity, which would undermine the attractiveness of wind energy and thus wind turbines, and, ultimately wind blades. If prices for electricity generated by wind turbines are not competitive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nWe encounter intense competition for limited customers from other wind blade manufacturers, as well as in-house production by wind turbine OEMs, which may make it difficult to enter into long-term supply agreements, keep existing customers and potentially get new customers.\nWe face significant competition from other wind blade manufacturers, and this competition may intensify in the future. The wind turbine market is characterized by a relatively small number of large OEMs. The competitive environment in the wind energy industry may become more challenging in the years ahead, particularly in the event of further consolidation in the industry, which could lead to us having even fewer customers. In addition, a significant percentage of wind turbine OEMs, including all of our current customers, produce some of their own\nwind blades in-house. As a result, we compete for business from a limited number of customers that outsource the production of wind blades. We also compete with a number of wind blade manufacturers in China, who are growing in terms of their technical capability and aspire to expand outside of China. Some of our competitors have more experience in the wind energy industry, as well as greater financial, technical or human resources than we do, which may limit our ability to compete effectively with them and maintain or improve our market share. Additionally, our long-term supply agreements dedicate capacity at our facilities to our customers, which may also limit our ability to compete if our facilities cannot accommodate additional capacity. If we are unable to compete effectively for the limited number of customers that outsource production of wind blades, our ability to enter into long-term supply agreements with potential new and existing customers may be materially harmed.\nWe rely on our research and development efforts to remain competitive, and we may fail to develop on a timely basis new wind blade manufacturing technologies that are commercially attractive or permit us to keep up with customer demands.\nThe market for wind blades is subject to evolving customer needs and expectations. Our research and development is invested in developing faster and more efficient manufacturing processes in order to build the new wind blades designed by our customers that more effectively capture wind energy and are adaptable to new growth segments of the wind energy market. Research and development activities are inherently uncertain and the results of our in-house research and development may not be successful. In addition, our competition may adopt more advanced technologies or develop wind blades that are more effective or commercially attractive. We believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to be at the forefront of technological innovation in the wind energy industry and to rapidly and cost-effectively adapt our wind blade manufacturing processes to keep pace with changing technologies, new wind blade design and changing customer needs. If we are unable to do so, our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation could be materially harmed.\nVarious legislation, regulations and incentives that are expected to support the growth of wind energy in the United States and around the world may not be extended or may be discontinued, phased out or changed, or may not be successfully implemented, which could materially harm wind energy programs and materially decrease demand for the wind blades we manufacture.\nThe U.S. wind energy industry has been dependent in part upon governmental support through certain incentives including federal tax incentives and state RPS programs and may not be economically viable if a large number of these incentives are not continued. Government-sponsored tax incentive programs including the PTC, and the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), are expected to continue to support the U.S. growth of wind energy. The PTC and ITC were recently extended for an additional year through the end of 2021. In addition, there are also increasing regulatory efforts globally to promote renewable power.\nBecause of the long lead times necessary to develop wind energy projects, any uncertainty or delay in adopting, extending or renewing the PTC, ITC or other incentives promoting wind energy beyond their current or future expiration dates could negatively impact potential wind energy installations and result in industry volatility. There can be no assurance that the PTC, the ITC, tender offers, auctions or other governmental programs or subsidies for renewable energy will remain in effect in their present form or at all, and the elimination, reduction, or modification of these programs or subsidies could materially harm wind energy programs in the United States and international markets and materially decrease demand for the wind blades we manufacture and, in turn, materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur long-term growth and success is dependent upon retaining our senior management and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur growth and success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified research and development, management, manufacturing and other key personnel including engineers in our various locations. In addition, we rely heavily on our management team, including William E. Siwek, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Ramesh Gopalakrishnan, our Chief Operating Officer - Wind; Bryan Schumaker, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior management. Although we have executed an employment agreement with each of these executives, these executives and other senior management can resign with little or no notice to us. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Hiring those persons may be especially difficult because of the\nspecialized nature of our business and our international operations. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, or if we lose the services of Messrs. Siwek, Gopalakrishnan, or Schumaker, other key members of senior management or other key personnel, and we do not have adequate succession plans in place, our ability to successfully execute our business plan, market and develop our products and serve our customers could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, because of our reliance on our management team, our future success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and develop talent to succeed its senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critical to the successful implementation of our future strategies.\nRisks Related to our Transportation Business\nOur efforts to expand our transportation business and enter into other strategic markets may not be successful.\nWhile our primary focus has been to manufacture composite wind blades, our strategy is to expand our transportation business and to enter into other strategic markets. In 2018, we expanded our relationship with Proterra and began supplying bus bodies from a new manufacturing facility in Newton, Iowa in addition to our manufacturing facility in Warren, Rhode Island. We experienced startup challenges and incurred significant losses in connection with the supply of bus bodies to Proterra from our Newton, Iowa manufacturing facility. As result, we closed our Newton, Iowa bus body manufacturing facility in the first quarter of 2020, and consolidated our bus body manufacturing operation into our Warren, Rhode Island manufacturing facility and a manufacturing facility in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. The expansion of our transportation business and our entry into other strategic markets will require improved execution in terms of our start up activity and ongoing manufacturing performance as well as significant levels of investment. There can be no assurance that our transportation business or other strategic markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in any such markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, litigation and other disputes and claims.\nWe are exposed to warranty and product liability claims if our transportation products fail to perform as expected. We may in the future be required to participate in a recall of these products or the vehicles incorporating our products. If public safety concerns are raised, we may have to participate in a recall even if our products are ultimately found not to be defective. Vehicle manufacturers have experienced increasing recall campaigns in recent years. Our customers may look to us for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. If our customers demand higher warranty-related cost recoveries, or if our transportation products fail to perform as expected, our business, financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Business as a Whole\nOur business, operations and financial condition during the year ended December 31, 2020 were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and we cannot estimate the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and our business may be adversely affected in the future if the COVID-19 pandemic persists.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our business and operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, our China manufacturing facilities were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the form of reduced production levels and COVID-19 related costs associated with the health and safety of our associates and non-productive labor. During the second quarter of 2020, all of our manufacturing facilities with the exception of our China manufacturing facilities and our Rhode Island manufacturing facility were required to temporarily suspend production or operate at reduced production levels due primarily to certain applicable government-mandated stay at home orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, demands from certain of our labor unions to suspend or reduce production and general safety concerns of our associates. By the end of the second quarter of 2020, most of our manufacturing facilities had returned to operating at or near normal production levels. We may be required to reinstate temporary production suspensions or volume reductions at our other manufacturing facilities to the extent there is a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the regions where we operate or there is an outbreak of positive COVID-19 cases in any of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, although we currently have not experienced any significant disruptions in our global supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our global supply chain may in the future be adversely affected if the COVID-19 pandemic persists.\nOur financial position, revenue, operating results, profitability and cash flows are difficult to predict and may vary from quarter to quarter, which could cause our share price to decline significantly.\nOur quarterly revenue, operating results, profitability and cash flows have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. For example, our quarterly results have ranged from operating income of $29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 to an operating loss of $15.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The factors that are likely to cause these variations include:\n\u2022\noperating and startup costs of new manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nwind blade model transitions;\n\u2022\ndiffering quantities of wind blade production;\n\u2022\nunanticipated contract or project delays or terminations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the costs of raw materials or disruptions in raw material supply;\n\u2022\nscrap of defective products;\n\u2022\npayment of liquidated damages to our customers for late deliveries of our products;\n\u2022\nwarranty expense;\n\u2022\navailability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nemployee wage levels;\n\u2022\ncosts incurred in the expansion of our existing manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nvolume reduction requests from our customers pursuant to our customer agreements;\n\u2022\ndamage or production delays caused by earthquakes, fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, extreme weather conditions such as windstorms, hailstorms, drought, temperature extremes, typhoons or other natural disasters or terrorism or health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rate;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe complexity of the financial assumptions we must use for forecasting our revenue, profitability and operating results under the revenue recognition standard and the impact that unanticipated blade transitions have on those estimates.\nAs a result, our revenue, operating results, profitability and cash flows for a particular period are difficult to predict and may decline in comparison to corresponding prior periods regardless of the strength of our business. It is also possible that in some future periods our revenue, operating results and profitability may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nThe fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates could materially harm our financial results.\nSince we conduct a significant portion of our operations internationally, our business is subject to foreign currency risks, including currency exchange rate fluctuations. The exchange rates are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. For example, an increase in our Turkey sales and operations will result in a larger portion of our net sales and expenditures being denominated in the Euro and Turkish Lira. Significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Turkish Lira and the U.S. dollar, the Turkish Lira and the Euro or the Euro and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our revenue, expenses, as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. To the extent our future revenues and expenses are generated outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, the Turkish Lira, the Chinese Renminbi, Mexican Peso or India Rupee, among others, we will be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur manufacturing operations and future growth are dependent upon the availability of capital, which may be insufficient to support our capital expenditures.\nOur current wind blade manufacturing activities and future growth will require substantial capital investment. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our capital expenditures were $65.8 million and $80.2 million, respectively, including assets acquired under finance leases in 2020 and 2019 of $0.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively. We have recently entered into lease agreements with third parties to lease new manufacturing facilities in China, India and Mexico. Major projects expected to be undertaken include purchasing equipment for our new manufacturing facility in Chennai, India and the continued investment in our Turkey, Mexico, China and Iowa facilities. Our ability to grow our business is predicated upon us making significant additional capital investments to expand our existing manufacturing facilities and build and operate new manufacturing facilities in existing and new markets. We generally estimate that the startup of a new multi-line manufacturing facility requires cash for net operating expenses and working capital of between $20 million to $25 million and additional capital expenditures primarily for machinery and equipment of between $40 million to $50 million. In addition, we estimate our annual maintenance capital expenditures to be between $1 million to $3 million per facility. We may not have the capital to undertake these capital investments. In addition, our capital expenditures may be significantly higher if our estimates of future capital investments are incorrect and may increase substantially if we are required to undertake actions to comply with new regulatory requirements or compete with new technologies. The cost of some projects may also be affected by foreign exchange rates if any raw materials or other goods must be paid for in foreign currency. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds on favorable terms, if at all, or that future financings would not be dilutive to holders of our capital stock. We also cannot assure you that completed capital expenditures will yield the anticipated results. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants, or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility, and would require us to fund additional interest expense. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital at a reasonable cost or at all, we may not be able to expand production sufficiently to take advantage of changes in the marketplace or may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our current operations, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs a U.S. corporation with international operations, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which could impact our ability to compete in certain jurisdictions.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. We have manufacturing facilities in China, Mexico, Turkey and India, countries with a fairly high risk of corruption. Those facilities are subject to routine government oversight. In addition, a number of our raw materials and components suppliers are state-owned, particularly in China. Moreover, due to our need to import raw materials across international borders, we also routinely have interactions, directly or indirectly, with customs officials. In many foreign countries, under local custom, businesses engage in practices that may be prohibited by the FCPA or other similar laws and regulations. Additionally, we continue to hire employees around the world as we continue to expand. Although we have implemented certain procedures and controls designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, there can be no guarantee that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, have not taken and will not take actions that violate our policies and the FCPA, which could subject us to fines, penalties, disgorgement, and loss of business, harm our reputation and impact our ability to compete in certain jurisdictions. In addition, these laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we may be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof. Moreover, our competitors may not be subject to the FCPA or comparable legislation, which could provide them with a competitive advantage in some jurisdictions.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively address fraud risks.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory\nenvironments and to expend significant resources to establish and maintain a system of internal controls that will be adequate to satisfy the reporting obligations of a public company. The effectiveness of our internal controls depends in part on the cooperation of senior managers worldwide.\nAny system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that system, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and harm our business, and lead to our becoming subject to litigation, sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ), the SEC or other regulatory governmental agencies and bodies. Furthermore, investors\u2019 perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund debt service requirements, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and regulatory conditions and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult to react quickly to, changing conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with those of our competitors that have less debt and lower debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to potentially incur additional expenses to amend our London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-indexed loans to a new reference rate due to the planned phase out of the use of LIBOR;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates since some of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.\nIn addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay our outstanding indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs or to comply with the financial covenants set forth therein. If we are not able to pay our debts as they become due, we could be in default under our senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness. We might also be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies to repay indebtedness, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if we must sell assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenues.\nMuch of our intellectual property consists of trade secrets and know-how that is very difficult to protect. If we experience loss of protection for our trade secrets or know-how, our business would be substantially harmed.\nWe have a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and copyrights, but much of our most important intellectual property rights consist of trade secrets and know-how and effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable, limited or outside the scope of the intellectual property rights we pursue in the United States and in foreign countries such as China where we operate. Although we strive to protect our intellectual property rights, there is always a risk that our trade secrets or know-how will be compromised or that a competitor could lawfully reverse-engineer our technology or independently develop similar or more efficient technology. We have confidentiality agreements with each of our customers, suppliers, key employees and\nindependent contractors in place to protect our intellectual property rights, but it is possible that a customer, supplier, employee or contractor might breach the agreement, intentionally or unintentionally. For example, we believe a key former employee may have shared some of our intellectual property with a competitor in China and this former employee or the competitor may use this intellectual property to compete with us in the future. It is also possible that our confidentiality agreements with customers, suppliers, employees and contractors will not be effective in preserving the confidential nature of our intellectual property rights. The patents we own could be challenged, invalidated, narrowed or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Once our patents expire, or if they are invalidated, narrowed or circumvented, our competitors may be able to utilize the inventions protected by our patents. Additionally, the existence of our intellectual property rights does not guarantee that we will be successful in any attempt to enforce these rights against third parties in the event of infringement, misappropriation or other misuse, which may materially and adversely affect our business. Because our ability to effectively compete in our industry depends upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, we might lose business to competitors and our business, revenue, operating results and prospects could be materially harmed if we suffer loss of trade secret and know-how protection or breach of our confidentiality agreements.\nWe may be subject to significant liabilities and costs relating to environmental and health and safety requirements.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate governing, among other things, health, safety, pollution and protection of the environment and natural resources, the handling and use of hazardous substances, the generation, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, and the cleanup of any contaminated sites. In June 2018, Iowa\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a division of the Iowa Department of Labor, issued a citation and notification of penalty to us alleging that certain of our workplace practices and conditions at our Newton, Iowa wind blade manufacturing facility had violated the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Act. Specifically, the citation cited us for multiple alleged violations and proposed that we pay an aggregate penalty of $0.2 million. In March 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Iowa Department of Labor pursuant to which we agreed to make a settlement payment of $0.1 million and to implement certain safety enhancements at our Newton, Iowa manufacturing facility to fully resolve this matter.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures to comply with such laws, regulations and permit requirements. While we believe that we currently are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations and permit requirements, any noncompliance may subject us to a range of enforcement measures, including the imposition of monetary fines and penalties, other civil or criminal sanctions, remedial obligations, and the issuance of compliance requirements restricting our operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not in the future become subject to compliance requirements, obligations to undertake cleanup or related activities, or claims or proceedings relating to environmental, health or safety matters, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminated sites, or other environmental or natural resource damages, that could impose significant liabilities and costs on us and materially harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nClaims that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise misuse the intellectual property rights of others could subject us to significant liability and disrupt our business.\nOur competitors and third-party suppliers of components and raw materials used in our products protect their intellectual property rights by means such as trade secrets and patents. In the future we may be sued for violations of other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, and the risk of this type of lawsuit will likely increase as our size, geographic presence and market share expand and as the number of competitors in our market increases. Any such claims or litigation, whether meritorious or not, could disrupt our business and materially harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, intellectual property disputes have in the past arisen between our customers which negatively affected such customers\u2019 demand for wind blades manufactured by us. If such intellectual property disputes involving, or between, one or more of our customers should arise in the future, our business could be materially harmed.\nWork disruptions resulting from our collective bargaining agreements could result in increased operating costs and materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our employees in Turkey and Matamoros, Mexico, which in the aggregate represented approximately 38% of our workforce as of December 31, 2020, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our collective bargaining agreement for our Turkey facilities are in effect through the end of 2020 and we are in the process of negotiating an amendment for calendar year 2021. In March 2018, we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with a labor union for certain of our employees in our Matamoros, Mexico facility. In January 2019, thousands of workers employed in dozens of manufacturing facilities in Matamoros, Mexico, went on strike. In general, these workers, who were represented by several different labor unions, demanded an increase in their wage rate and an annual bonus. In February 2019, our manufacturing production employees in Matamoros, Mexico, who are represented by a labor union, went on strike also demanding an increase in their hourly wage rate and the payment of an annual bonus. During this strike, our Matamoros manufacturing facility stopped production for several weeks until we reached a revised agreement with our labor union. We recently amended our Matamoros collective bargaining agreement to adjust the salaries and bonuses payable to our associates for calendar year 2021 that are covered by this agreement.\nAdditionally, our other employees working at other manufacturing facilities may vote to be represented by a labor union in the future. There can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages or other slowdowns by workers at any of our facilities. Should significant industrial action, threats of strikes or related disturbances occur, we could experience further disruptions of operations and increased labor costs in Turkey, Mexico or other locations, which could materially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. Any such work stoppage or slow-down at any of our facilities could also result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue for us.\nOur information technology infrastructure could experience serious failures or disruptions, the failure of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nInformation technology is part of our business strategy and operations. It enables us to streamline operation processes, facilitate the collection and reporting of business data, and provide for internal and external communications. There are risks that information technology system failures, network disruptions, breaches of data security and phishing and ransomware attacks could disrupt our operations. Any significant disruption or breach may materially harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.\nWe may be subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in the United States and around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax laws, including increased tax rates or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could harm our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the taxing authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns, or authorities in jurisdictions in which we do not file tax returns could assert that we are subject to tax in those jurisdictions, and in\neither case could impose additional tax, interest and penalties. Further, the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, or that our transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries are improper, any of which could have a material adverse impact on us and the results of our operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and your investment may decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide products due to shipments subject to delayed delivery and deferred revenue arrangements;\n\u2022\nloss of or changes in our relationship with one or more of our customers;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet our earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the energy and manufacturing markets in which we operate and changes in estimates of the size and growth rate of these markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, developments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022\navailability of equipment, labor and other items required for the manufacture of wind blades;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental policies;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully grow our transportation business;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or by our other principal stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of that company\u2019s securities. Securities class-action litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs or damages and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and operating results.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market in future sales, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market can occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had 36,563,798 shares of common stock outstanding. All shares can now be sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal securities laws. We may issue debt or equity securities under our automatic shelf registration statement, which we filed in September 2020, or in other registered or unregistered convertible debt or equity offerings.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material\nportion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you and may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nThe exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under our equity compensation plans will dilute your interest.\nUnder our existing equity compensation plans, as of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding options to purchase 1,499,586 shares of our common stock, 668,454 restricted stock units and 650,523 performance stock units to our employees and non-employee directors. From time to time, we expect to grant additional options and other stock awards. The exercise of options and warrants at prices below the market price of our common stock could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock. Additionally, any issuance of our common stock that is not made solely to then-existing stockholders proportionate to their interests, such as in the case of a stock dividend or stock split, will result in dilution to each stockholder by reducing their percentage ownership of the total outstanding shares. If we issue options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or we issue stock, stockholders may experience further dilution.\nProvisions of Delaware law or our charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include: a classified board of directors; limitations on the removal of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated by-laws; and the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote, and not less than 75% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions that are contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In addition, absent approval of our board of directors, our amended and restated by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our board of directors has not approved. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them.\nAs a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16188, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "TPIC"}
