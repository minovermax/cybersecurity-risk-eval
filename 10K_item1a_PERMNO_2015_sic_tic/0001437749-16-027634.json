These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below. The risks and uncertainties described in this report are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReviews, examinations and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking and consumer protection laws and regulations, and possible changes to those laws and regulations by legislative or regulatory action, may result in changes to our business practices or may expose us to the risk of fines, restitution and litigation.\nOur operations and the operations of our Bank Partners are subject to the jurisdiction and examination of federal, state and local regulatory authorities, including the FDIC, which is WEX Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, the OCC, which is Axiom\u2019s primary federal regulator, and the Federal Reserve Bank, which is Customers Bank primary federal regulator. Our business practices, including the terms of our products, are reviewed and approved by our Bank Partners and subject to both periodic and special reviews by such regulatory authorities, which can range from investigations into specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries into our practices generally. If, as part of any ongoing or future examination or review, the regulatory authorities conclude that we are not complying with applicable laws or regulations, they could request or impose a wide range of remedies, including, but not limited to, requiring changes to the terms of our products (such as decreases in fees or changes to the manner in which OneAccounts are marketed to students), the imposition of fines or penalties or the institution of enforcement proceedings or other similar actions against us alleging that our current or past practices constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As part of an enforcement action, the regulators can seek restitution for affected customers and impose civil money penalties. In addition, negative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation or any related fine could adversely affect our stock price, our relationships with various industry participants, including our Bank Partners, or our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2011, the New York Regional Office of the FDIC notified us that it was prepared to recommend to the Director of FDIC Supervision that an enforcement action be taken against us for alleged violations of certain applicable laws and regulations principally relating to our compliance management system and policies and practices for past overdraft charging on persistently delinquent accounts, collections and transaction error resolution. We responded to the FDIC\u2019s notification and voluntarily initiated a plan in December 2011, which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain insufficient fund fees. As a result of this plan, we recorded a reduction in our revenue of approximately $4.7 million in 2011. On August 8, 2012, we received a Consent Order, Order for Restitution, and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty, or the 2012 Consent Order, dated August 7, 2012, issued by the FDIC to settle such alleged violations. Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 Consent Order, we neither admitted nor denied any charges when agreeing to its terms. Under the terms of the 2012 Consent Order, we were required to, among other things, review and revise our compliance management system and, to date, we have substantially revised our compliance management system. Additionally, the 2012 Consent Order provided for restrictions on the charging of certain fees. The 2012 Consent Order further provided that we shall make restitution to less than 2% of our customers since 2008 for fees previously assessed, which restitution has been completed through the voluntary customer credit plan described above, and we paid a civil money penalty of $0.1 million.\nIn 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago notified us and a former bank partner of potential violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act relating to marketing and disclosure practices concerning OneAccounts during the period it was offered by such former bank partner. On May 9, 2014, the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago (the responsible Reserve Bank for a former bank partner) and Philadelphia (the responsible Reserve Bank for a current bank partner) notified us that the Staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System intended to recommend that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Board of Governors, seek an administrative order against us with respect to asserted violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The cited violations relate to our activities with both a former and current bank partner and our marketing and disclosure practices related to the process by which students may select the OneAccount option for financial aid refund.\nIn April 2015, the San Francisco Regional Office of the FDIC (the responsible Regional Office for a current bank partner) notified us it was prepared to recommend to the Director of the Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection that administrative enforcement action be taken against us for alleged violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act principally relating to our marketing and enrollment practices concerning OneAccounts. We have responded to the FDIC\u2019s notification and we believe that these allegations are similar and related to the Federal Reserve Board allegations previously disclosed and discussed above. On September 24, 2015, the San Francisco Regional Office of the FDIC provided a revised notification to us regarding those alleged violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\nOn December 23, 2015, the Board of Governors issued to HOI an Order to Cease and Desist and Order of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty Issued Upon Consent Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as Amended (\u201cFed Order\u201d), related to the Board of Governors matter discussed above. Pursuant to the terms of the Fed Order, HOI is required to, among other things: (1) continue to take all action necessary to correct all violations previously cited by the Board of Governors and prevent the recurrence of similar violations; (2) submit to the Philadelphia Reserve Bank an acceptable written plan to enhance the consumer compliance risk management program to ensure that the marketing, processing, and servicing of student financial aid-related deposit or loan products or services by Higher One comply with all consumer protection laws and regulations; (3) deposit $24.0 million into a qualified settlement fund for purposes of providing restitution of certain OneAccount fees to consumers, as provided by the Fed Order, and submit to the Philadelphia Reserve Bank an acceptable written plan to provide for the restitution; and (4) pay a civil money penalty of $2.2 million.\nAlso on December 23, 2015, the FDIC issued to HOI a Consent Order, Order for Restitution and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty (\u201cFDIC Order\u201d) related to the FDIC matter discussed above.. Pursuant to the terms of the FDIC Order, HOI is required to, among other things: (1) continue to correct and eliminate all violations of law previously cited by the FDIC and prevent the recurrence of similar violations; (2) review its Compliance Management System as it relates to its student financial aid-related deposit or loan products and revise, develop and/or implement changes as necessary to ensure such products and services comply with all applicable consumer protection laws; (3) deposit $31.0 million into a segregated deposit account for the purpose of providing restitution of certain OneAccount fees to consumers, as provided by the FDIC Order; and submit to the Regional Director of the FDIC for non-objection a plan to provide restitution; and (4) pay a civil money penalty of $2.2 million. Concurrent to HOI entering this FDIC Order, the FDIC lifted the August 7, 2012 Consent Order discussed above.\nAs a result of the FDIC Order and Fed Order, we recorded an allowance for customer restitution of approximately $46.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, representing the difference between the total amount of restitution of $55.0 million and the amount accrued as of December 31, 2014 of $8.75 million. In addition, we recorded expenses of approximately $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, representing the civil money penalty and our estimate of costs to administer the distribution of restitution funds. The total amount of restitution was deposited in a qualified settlement trust and the total civil money penalties was paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe remain subject to the jurisdiction and examination of the Board of Governors and the FDIC and further action could be taken to the extent we do not comply with the terms of the consent orders or if the Board of Governors or FDIC were to identify additional violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any further action could have a material adverse affect on the Company.\nPlease also refer to the \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d section within, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K for information related to the consent orders we received from the Board of Governors and the FDIC.\nAdditionally, since 2012, we have received and responded to inquiries and information requests from certain federal legislators and regulatory agencies. These requests sought information related to our financial aid refund processing and the related services which we provide to students. Certain federal legislators have also sent communications regarding similar matters to various federal agencies, including ED and the CFPB. These inquiries or others could lead to further action by these or other governmental actors or agencies, including the introduction of legislation or new regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial federal and state governmental regulation that could change and thus force us to make modifications to our business. Compliance with the various complex laws and regulations is costly and time consuming, and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, increased regulatory requirements on our services may increase our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a payments processor to higher education institutions we take payment instructions from institutions and their constituents, including students and employees, and gives them to our Bank Partners. Accordingly, we are directly or indirectly subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations. Our contracts with most of our higher education institution clients and our Bank Partners require us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including:\n\u25cf\nTitle IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, or Title IV;\n\u25cf\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1975, or FERPA;\n\u25cf\nthe Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E;\n\u25cf\nthe USA PATRIOT Act and related anti-money laundering requirements; and\n\u25cf\ncertain federal rules regarding safeguarding personal information, including rules implementing the privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or GLBA.\nHigher Education Regulations\nThird-Party Servicer. Because of the services we provide to some institutions with regard to the handling of Title IV funds, we are considered a \u201cthird-party servicer\u201d under the Title IV regulations. Those regulations require a third-party servicer annually to submit a compliance audit conducted by outside independent auditors that cover the servicer\u2019s Title IV activities. Each year we submit a \u201cCompliance Attestation Examination of the Title IV Student Financial Assistance Programs\u201d audit to ED, which includes a report by an independent audit firm. This yearly compliance audit submission to ED provides comfort to our higher education institution clients that we are in compliance with the third-party servicer regulations that may apply to us. We also provide this compliance audit report to clients upon request to help them fulfill their compliance audit obligations as Title IV participating institutions.\nUnder ED\u2019s regulations, a third party servicer that contracts with a Title IV institution acts in the nature of a fiduciary in the administration of Title IV programs. Among other requirements, the regulations provide that a third-party servicer is jointly and severally liable with its client institution for any liability to ED arising out of the servicer\u2019s violation of Title IV or its implementing regulations, which could subject us to material fines related to acts or omissions of entities beyond our control. ED is also empowered to limit, suspend or terminate the violating servicer\u2019s eligibility to act as a third-party servicer and to impose significant civil penalties on the violating servicer.\nAdditionally, on behalf of our higher education institution clients, we are required to comply with ED\u2019s cash management regulations regarding payment of financial aid credit balances to students and providing bank accounts to students that may be used for receiving such payments. In the event ED concluded that we had violated Title IV or its implementing regulations and should be subject to one or more of these sanctions, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. There is limited enforcement and interpretive history of Title IV regulations.\nIn 2012, ED published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to draft proposed regulations designed to prevent fraud through the use of electronic fund transfers to students\u2019 bank accounts, ensure proper use of federal financial aid funds, address the use of debit cards and other banking products for disbursing federal financial aid funds, and improve and streamline campus\u2019 financial aid programs. In 2013, ED announced additional topics for consideration, and in early 2014, formed a negotiated rulemaking committee. The negotiated rulemaking committee concluded its efforts in May 2014 and a consensus was not reached on any proposed regulations. On May 18, 2015, ED published its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM on program integrity and improvement issues. Final rules relating to Title IV Cash Management were published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2015. The Final Rules included, among others, provisions related to (i) restrictions on the ability of higher education institutions and third party servicers like the Company to market financial products to students including sending unsolicited debit cards to students, (ii) prohibitions on the assessment of certain types of account fees on student accountholders and (iii) requirements related to ATM access for student accountholders that would become effective as of July 1, 2016. Although the complete impact of the Final Rules are unknown, there could be a significant negative impact on the disbursement business, including related to OneAccounts.\nFERPA. Our higher education institution clients are subject to FERPA, which provides, with certain exceptions, that an educational institution that receives any federal funding under a program administered by ED may not have a policy or practice of disclosing education records or \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d from education records, other than directory information, to third parties without the student\u2019s or parent\u2019s written consent. Our higher education institution clients that use the Refund Managements disbursement services disclose to us certain non-directory information concerning their students, including contact information, student identification numbers and the amount of students\u2019 credit balances. Additionally, our higher education institution clients that use Campus Labs\u00ae products also share personally identifiable information with us. We believe that our higher education institution clients may disclose this information to us without the students\u2019 or their parents\u2019 consent pursuant to one or more exceptions under FERPA. However, if ED asserts that we do not fall into one of these exceptions or if future changes to legislation or regulations require student consent before our higher education institution clients can disclose this information to us, a sizeable number of students may cease using our products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as we are indirectly subject to FERPA, we may not permit the transfer of any personally identifiable information to another party other than in a manner in which a higher education institution may disclose it. In the event that we re-disclose student information in violation of this requirement, FERPA requires our clients to suspend our access to any such information for a period of five years. Any such suspension could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nState Laws. We may also be subject to similar state laws and regulations, including those that restrict higher education institutions from disclosing certain personally identifiable information of students. State attorneys general and other enforcement agencies may monitor our compliance with state and federal laws and regulations that affect our business, including those pertaining to higher education and banking, and conduct investigations of our business that are time consuming and expensive and could result in fines and penalties that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In July 2014, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pursuant to the Commonwealth's Consumer Protection Act. The Massachusetts Attorney General has informed us that its investigation relates to our debt collection practices. We provided the information requested by the civil investigative demand, which included information and records about our company and certain of our business practices, particularly as they relate to Massachusetts residents, institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts, and students who attended those institutions. We cannot predict whether we will become subject to any action by the Massachusetts Attorney General or any other state agencies.\nAdditionally, individual state legislatures may propose and enact new laws that restrict or otherwise affect our ability to offer our products and services as we currently do, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the legislation has been introduced in the State of Oregon which may further regulate the disbursement of financial aid refunds and associated financial products and services.\nRegulation of OneAccounts\nAnti-Money Laundering; USA PATRIOT ACT; Office of Foreign Assets Control. Our Bank Partners are insured depository institutions and funds held by them are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits. As insured depository institutions, our Bank Partners are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision and, in the course of making their services available to our customers, we are required to assist our bank partners in complying with certain of their regulatory obligations. In particular, the anti-money laundering provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified whenever a checking account is established. For example, because we facilitate the opening of checking accounts at our Bank Partners on behalf of our customers, we assist our bank partners in collecting the customer identification information that is necessary to open an account. In addition, both we and our Bank Partners are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulators could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nCompliance; Audit. As a service provider to insured depository institutions, we are required under applicable federal and state laws to submit to examination by our Bank Partners\u2019 regulators. We also are subject to audit by our Bank Partners to ensure that we comply with our obligations to them appropriately. Failure to comply with our responsibilities properly could negatively affect our operations. Our Bank Partners are required under our respective agreements to comply with state and federal banking regulations. The failure of our bank partners to maintain regulatory compliance could result in significant disruptions to our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nElectronic Fund Transfer Act; Regulation E. Our Bank Partners provide depository services for OneAccounts through a private label relationship. We provide processing services for OneAccounts for our Bank Partners. These services are subject to, among other things, the requirements of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the CFPB\u2019s Regulation E, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers\u2019 rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs, debit cards and certain other electronic banking services. We may assist our bank partners with fulfilling their compliance obligations pursuant to these requirements. See \u201cFees for financial services are subject to increasingly intense legislative and regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for future growth\u201d below in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoney Transmitter Regulations. Because our technology services are provided in connection with the financial products of our bank partners, our activities are occasionally reviewed by regulatory agencies to ensure that we do not impermissibly engage in activities that require licensing at the state or federal level. In the ordinary course of business, we receive letters and inquiries concerning the nature of our business as it applies to state \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d licensing and regulations from different state regulatory agencies. If a state agency were to conclude that we are required to be licensed as a \u201cmoney transmitter,\u201d we may need to undergo a costly licensing process in that state, and failure to comply could be a violation of state and potentially federal law.\nPrivacy and Data Regulation\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and data regarding our customers and their financial information. In addition, we are bound by our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data, which are posted on our website.\nIn conjunction with the disbursement, payroll and tuition payment services we make available through our Bank Partners, we collect certain information from our customers (such as bank account and routing numbers) to transmit to our bank partners. Our bank partners use this information to execute the funds transfers requested by our customers, which are effected primarily by means of ACH networks and other wire transfer systems, such as FedWire. To the extent the data required by these electronic funds networks change, the information that we will be required to request from our clients may also change.\nWe are subject, either directly or by virtue of our contractual relationship with our bank partners, to the privacy and security standards of the GLBA privacy regulations, as well as certain state data protection laws and regulations. The GLBA privacy regulations require that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program prescribing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any personally identifiable information we access for processing purposes or otherwise maintain. As a service provider of our bank partners, we also are limited in our use and disclosure of the personal information we receive from our bank partners, which we may use and disclose only for the purposes for which it was provided to us and consistent with the bank\u2019s own data privacy and security obligations. We also are subject to the standards set forth in guidance on data security issued by the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council, as well as the data security standards imposed by the card associations, including Visa, Inc., and MasterCard. In addition, we are subject to similar data security breach laws enacted by a number of states.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations, or with our own privacy policies, could result in fines, sanctions, litigation, negative publicity, limitation of our ability to conduct our business and injury to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew legislation and regulations in this area have been proposed, both at the federal and state level. Such measures, including pending Federal legislation, would potentially impose additional obligations on us, including requiring that we provide notifications to consumers and government authorities in the event of a data breach or unauthorized access or disclosure, beyond what state law already requires. These laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of our operations\nCompliance\nWe monitor our compliance through (i) an internal audit program, led by our vice president of internal audit, (ii) our compliance management system, led by our chief compliance officer and (iii) a risk management program, led by our chief risk officer. Our internal audit team works with a third-party internal audit firm to conduct annual reviews to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements described above. The costs of these audits and the costs of complying with the applicable regulatory requirements are significant. Increased regulatory requirements on our products and services, such as in connection with the matters described above, could materially increase our costs or reduce revenue.\nIt is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become law. The imposition of any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions. If we were deemed to be in violation of any laws or regulations that are currently in place or that may be promulgated in the future, including those described above, we could be exposed to financial liability and negative publicity or forced to change our business practices or stop offering some of our products and services. We also could face significant legal fees, delays in extending our product and services offerings and damage to our reputation that could harm our business and reduce demand for our products and services. Even if we are not required to change our business practices, we could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could cause us to incur substantial legal fees, costs and delays.\nThe fees that we generate through our relationships with higher education institutions and their campus communities are subject to competitive pressures and are subject to change, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe generate revenue from, among other sources, the banking services fees charged to our OneAccount holders, interchange fees related to purchases made through our debit and ATM cards, which our Bank Partners charge and remit to us, convenience fees from processing tuition payments on behalf of students, fees charged to our higher education institution clients and service fees that we receive from our Bank Partners.\nIn an increasingly price-conscious and competitive market that is also subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, it is possible that to maintain our competitive position with higher education institutions, we may have to decrease the fees we charge institutions for our services. Similarly, in order to maintain our competitive position with our OneAccount holders, we may need to work with our Bank Partners to reduce or otherwise alter the structure of the banking services fees charged to our OneAccount holders.\nMasterCard could reduce the interchange rates, which it unilaterally sets and adjusts from time to time, and upon which our interchange revenue is dependent. In addition, OneAccount holders may modify their spending habits and increase their use of ACH relative to their use of Higher One debit MasterCard, as ACH payments are generally free, which could reduce the interchange fees remitted to us. Students may also become less willing to pay convenience fees when using our payment transaction services. If our fees are reduced as described above, our business, results of operations and prospects for future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn July 2012, a memorandum of understanding was filed between a number of class action plaintiffs and Visa and MasterCard. The memorandum of understanding provides among other things, that all defendants in the case will pay a total of $6.05 billion to class plaintiffs and that each network will make certain changes to network rules regarding merchant point of sale practices. The December 13, 2013 decision of the court which granted approval to the settlement is currently being appealed. If MasterCard makes changes to their network rules regarding merchant point of sale practices, our business, results of operations and prospects for future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nFees for financial services are subject to increasingly intense legislative and regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for future growth.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is generated from interchange fees, ATM fees, non-sufficient funds fees, other banking services fees and convenience fees. These fees, as well as the financial services industry in general, have undergone substantial changes in recent years and may continue to do so in the near future. For example, in 2013 we made certain changes to our fee schedule, including removal of a fee that was assessed to abandoned accounts, removal of a fee that was assessed to customers that have not repaid an overdraft balance within an allotted time period, institution of a maximum daily amount of non-withdrawal ATM fees and a decrease in the types of transactions that can produce an insufficient funds fee. These, and other potential changes we may make in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for future growth.\nIn 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the already substantial regulation and oversight of the financial services industry and imposed restrictions on the ability of firms within the industry, including us, to conduct business consistent with historical practices. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, to regulate any person engaged in a \u201cfinancial activity\u201d in connection with a consumer financial product or service, including those, such as us, that process financial services products and services. The CFPB has assumed regulatory authority for many of the consumer protection laws to which we and our Bank Partners are subject and may have direct supervisory authority over us. The CFPB also has authority to issue and enforce regulations relating to consumer financial protection designed to prevent unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices in the offering of consumer financial products. In early 2013, the CFPB issued a request for information regarding financial products marketed to students enrolled in institutions of higher education, and in September 2013, the CFPB hosted a forum on this topic at which selected members of the public, including students and representatives from institutions, state government agencies and ED were invited to present and some of the participants expressed opinions that were unfavorable of us. Additionally, in early 2014, ED convened a negotiated rulemaking committee that worked to establish new regulations on topics such as fees associated with debit cards that are marketed to students for purposes of receiving financial aid refunds. On May 18, 2015, ED published its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM on program integrity and improvement issues. Final rules relating to Title IV Cash Management were published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2015. The Final Rules included, among others, provisions related to (i) restrictions on the ability of higher education institutions and third party servicers like the Company to market financial products to students including sending unsolicited debit cards to students, (ii) prohibitions on the assessment of certain types of account fees on student accountholders and (iii) requirements related to ATM access for student accountholders that would become effective as of July 1, 2016. Although the complete impact of the Final Rules are unknown, the Final Rules and such new regulations or action by the CFPB could require us to make changes to our fee schedules, which could result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also required changes to the manner in which merchants accept and process certain debit- and credit-card transactions. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act, subject to certain exemptions, requires the Federal Reserve to impose limits on debit card interchange fees tied principally to the cost of processing the transaction, which may have the result of decreasing revenue to debit card issuers and processors. In 2011, the Federal Reserve\u2019s final rule implementing these limits on debit card interchange fees became effective. Issuers such as our Bank Partners that, together with their affiliates, have less than $10 billion in assets are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards, although they are subject to other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibitions on network exclusivity and routing restrictions. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that smaller issuers, such as our Bank Partners, may also be impacted. Some federal, state, and local government-administered payment programs that use debit cards are exempt from this interchange fee restriction.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Act permits merchants to offer a discount or other incentive to encourage use of one form of payment over another. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s final rule, prohibits an issuer or payment card network from restricting the number of payment card networks over which an electronic debit transaction may be processed to fewer than two unaffiliated networks, or restricting the ability of a merchant to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process the electronic debit transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also allows merchants to set minimum purchase thresholds for credit card transactions, provided such thresholds do not exceed $10, and it permits institutions of higher education and federal agencies - which constitute many of our clients - to impose maximum dollar amounts for credit-card purchases. Individual state legislatures are also reviewing interchange fees, and legislators in a number of states have proposed bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies also frequently propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, although changes to existing law could affect how we and our Bank Partners operate and could significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nThe scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions, including those noted above, will continue to be determined through the rule making process. As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on us or our Bank Partners at this time, nor can we predict the impact or substance of other future legislation or regulation. However, we believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and other changes in regulation and legislation under consideration by the states could affect how we and our Bank Partners operate by significantly reducing the interchange fees, ATM fees, non-sufficient fund fees, other banking services fees and convenience fees charged in respect of our services and that are important to our financial results. These regulatory and legislative changes could also increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our Bank Partners for certain banking services, and a change in the relationships, or difficulties implementing our program, with our Bank Partners or their failure to comply with certain banking regulations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs the provider of FDIC-insured depository services for all OneAccounts, as well as other banking functions, such as supplying cash for our ATM machines, our bank partners provide third-party services that are critical to our student-oriented banking services. Within the past few years, we have experienced turnover with respect to our bank partners, which presents certain risks and uncertainties. For example, on February 8, 2013, we agreed to a mutual termination with Cole Taylor of our Deposit Processing Services Agreement to be effective August 30, 2013. On July 11, 2013, we entered into an agreement with Customers Bank under which it currently provides deposit services as a bank partner. In connection with transitioning bank partners, we made certain changes to our practices and operations, and could be required to make further changes in the future. Should we encounter any difficulties in on-boarding, retaining or transitioning bank partners, we may not be able to continue offering the OneAccount in the same manner as we do now, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, in the future, if we are not able to transition the functions performed by our then current bank partners to another financial institution, or, to the extent necessary, replace a current bank partner, we may not be able to continue offering the OneAccount in the same manner as we do now, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if any material adverse event were to affect any of our bank partners or future bank partners, including, a significant decline in financial condition, a decline in the quality of service, loss of deposits, a change in deposit classification related to the OneAccounts, inability to comply with applicable banking and financial service regulatory requirements, systems failure or inability to pay us fees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. There is also a risk that the terms of our services agreement with future bank partners may not be as favorable to us as our current agreements. The aggregate impact of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may suffer because of competition in the industries in which we do business.\nThe market for our products and services is competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, subject to rapid technological change. Our disbursement services compete against all forms of payment, including paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks), electronic transactions such as wire transfers and Automated Clearing House, or ACH, payments and other electronic forms of payment, including card-based payment systems. Many competitors, including Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc., provide payment software, products and services that compete with those we offer. In addition, our OneAccount, which we provide through our Bank Partners, also competes with banks active in the higher education market, including national, regional and local banks. Future competitors may begin to focus on higher education institutions in a manner similar to us.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may in the future offer a wider range of products and services and may use advertising and marketing strategies that achieve broader brand recognition or acceptance. In addition, our competitors may develop new products, services or technologies that render our products, services or technologies obsolete or less marketable. If we cannot continue to compete effectively against our competitors in any of our product offerings, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nThe length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for signing potential higher education institution clients could delay new sales of our products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe sales cycle between our initial contact with a potential higher education institution client and the signing of a contract with that client can be lengthy. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, our ability to forecast accurately the timing of revenues associated with new sales is limited. Our sales cycle varies widely due to significant uncertainties, over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u25cf\nthe individual decision-making processes of each higher education institution client, which typically include extensive and lengthy evaluations and require us to spend substantial time, effort and money educating each client about the value of our products and services;\n\u25cf\nthe budgetary constraints and priorities and budget cycle of each higher education institution client; and\n\u25cf\nthe reluctance of higher education staff to change or modify existing processes and procedures.\nIn addition, there is no guarantee that a potential client will sign a contract with us even after we spend substantial time, effort and money educating that potential client about the value of our products and services. Recently, the duration of the sales process has lengthened due in part to the current regulatory environment and the uncertainty that it presents. A delay in our ability or a failure to enter into new contracts with potential higher education institution clients could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our relationship with higher education institutions and, in turn, student usage of our products and services for future growth of our business.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to enter into agreements with higher education institutions. Our contracts with these clients can generally be terminated at will and, therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these clients. We may also be unable to maintain our agreements with these clients on terms and conditions acceptable to us. In addition, we may not be able to continue to establish new relationships with higher education institution clients at our historical growth rate or at all. The termination of our current client contracts or our inability to continue to attract new clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstablishing new client relationships and maintaining current ones are also essential components of our strategy for attracting new student customers, deepening the relationship we have with existing customers and maximizing customer usage of our products and services. A reduction in enrollment, a failure to attract and maintain student customers, as well as any future demographic or other trends that reduce the number of higher education students could materially and adversely affect our capability for both revenue and cash generation and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, since 2012, we have experienced a decrease in the proportion of OneAccounts that received a financial aid refund as well as a decrease in refund sizes compared to the prior periods. These decreases have had a negative impact on our results of operations since that time and we continue to lack visibility into these enrollment trends, which could have a further negative impact on our results of operations if this trend continues.\nOur business and future success may suffer if we are unable to cross-sell our products and services.\nA significant component of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to cross-sell products and services to new and existing higher education institution clients. In particular, our growth strategy depends on our ability to successfully cross-sell our disbursement and payments services to clients that do not already use our entire suite of products. We may not be successful in cross-selling our products and services because our clients may find our additional products and services unnecessary or unattractive. Our failure to sell additional products and services to new and existing clients could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal economic and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decrease in consumer confidence due to a weakened global economy may cause decreased spending among our student customers and may decrease the use of the OneAccount. Increases in college tuition alongside stagnation or reduction in available financial aid may also restrict spending among college students and the size of disbursements, reducing the use of the OneAccount and demand for our disbursement services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to manage future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued development of our business may place a significant strain upon our management and administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our strategy contemplates further increasing the number of our higher education institution clients and student banking customers, but the rate at which we have been able to establish relationships with our customers in the past may not be indicative of the rate at which we will be able to establish additional customer relationships in the future.\nOur success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. Our ability to grow also depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees, obtain financing for our capital needs, maintain and expand our systems effectively, control increasing costs, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between our operational functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressures on our management and administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we face as we continue to expand our operations or that we will be able to manage growth effectively or achieve further growth at all. If our business does not continue to grow or if we fail to effectively manage any future growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on key members of management and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have historically depended on the efforts, skill and reputations of our senior executive team, including Marc Sheinbaum (Chief Executive Officer and President) Casey McGuane (Chief Operating Officer), Robert Reach (Chief Sales Officer) and Christopher Wolf (Chief Financial Officer). We do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers. None of our executive officers have entered into employment agreements with us that would prevent them from terminating their involvement with us at any time and/or pursuing other opportunities. The loss of any of our executive officers or other members of management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our company, growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage, and retain other qualified management, as well as technical and operational personnel. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel in the future, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe may not be able to meet all of the continuing criteria required in order to retain the various subsidies, grants and credits we have received in connection with our rehabilitation and development project.\nWe have received various subsidies, grants and credits from different state and federal agencies and private entities that will offset our investment in the rehabilitation project relating to our headquarters facility. Many of these programs have criteria that we must meet on an ongoing basis in order to prevent forfeiture of the subsidies, grants and credits, and in some cases the imposition of a penalty. If we are not able to meet the continuing criteria, we may forfeit some or all of the incentives we have received.\nThe convenience fees that we charge in connection with payment transactions are subject to change.\nMost credit and debit card associations and networks permit us to charge convenience fees to students, parents or other payers who make online payments to our higher education institution clients through the SmartPay feature of our ePayment product and our NetPay and Tuition Payment Plan products using a credit or debit card. In 2012, these convenience fees accounted for substantially all of our payment transaction revenue, which is a trend we expect to continue going forward. While the majority of credit and debit card associations and networks routinely permit merchants and other third parties to charge these fees, it is not a ubiquitous practice in the payment industry. If these credit and debit card associations and networks change their policies in permitting merchants and other third-parties to charge these fees or otherwise restrict our ability to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with charging convenience fees.\nThrough our SmartPay service and our NetPay and Tuition Payment Plan services, which we acquired from Sallie Mae in May 2013, some of our higher education institution clients charge convenience fees to students, parents or other payers who make online payments using a credit or debit card. In light of the ongoing legislative efforts at financial regulatory reform, we examined the laws and regulations related to convenience fees. We found that these laws and regulations vary from state to state and certain states, including California, Massachusetts and New York, have laws that to varying degrees prohibit the imposition of a surcharge on a credit or debit cardholder who elects to use a credit or debit card in lieu of payment by cash, check or other means. The penalties for violating these laws vary and certain states impose fines that could be significant.\nWe are not aware of any enforcement or civil action against a higher education institution or a third party service provider for charging convenience fees. We have nevertheless worked with our higher education institution clients to ensure that we can continue to provide the services they demand, while ensuring we are in compliance with these laws and regulations prospectively. If one or more states or other parties initiate an action against us, we could be subject to a claim for significant fines or damages. Moreover, the beginning of any such action could disrupt our operations or result in negative publicity, which could diminish our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients, and could materially and adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the current government financial aid regime that relies on the outsourcing of financial aid disbursements through higher education institutions.\nIn general, the U.S. federal government distributes financial aid to students through higher education institutions as intermediaries. Our Refund Management disbursement service provides our higher education institution clients an electronic system for improving the administrative efficiency of this refund disbursement process. If the government, through legislation or regulatory action, restructures the existing financial aid regime in such a way that reduces or eliminates the intermediary role played by financial institutions serving higher education institutions or limits or regulates the role played by service providers such as us, our business, results of operations and prospects for future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nA change in the availability of financial aid, as well as U.S. budget constraints, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance by reducing demand for our services.\nThe higher education industry depends heavily upon the ability of students to obtain financial aid. As part of our contracts with our higher education institution clients that use Refund Management disbursement services, students\u2019 financial aid and other refunds are sent to us for disbursement. The fees that we charge most of our Refund Management disbursement service higher education institution clients are based on the number of financial aid disbursements that we make to students. In addition, our relationships with Refund Management disbursement service higher education institution clients provide us with a market for OneAccounts, from which we derive a significant proportion of our revenues. Consequently, a change in the availability or amount of financial aid that restricted client use of our Refund Management disbursement service or otherwise limited our ability to attract new higher education institution clients could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Also, decreases in the amount of financial aid disbursements from higher education institutions to students could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Future legislative and executive branch efforts to reduce the U.S. federal budget deficit or worsening economic conditions may require the government to severely curtail its financial aid spending, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTermination of, or changes to, the MasterCard association registration could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our Bank Partners, which issue our Higher One debit MasterCards, are subject to MasterCard association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by MasterCard for acts or omissions by us or businesses that work with us. The termination of the card association registration held by us or our Bank Partners or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide our products and services could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a changing and unpredictable regulatory environment. If we are subject to new legislation, industry standards or software upgrades regarding the operation of our ATMs, we could be required to make substantial expenditures to comply.\nThe U.S. ATM industry is subject to the rules and regulations of the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which establishes the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in the electronic funds transfer system. The vast majority of states have few, if any, licensing requirements. However, legislation related to the U.S. ATM industry is periodically proposed at the state and local level. In recent years, certain members of the U.S. Congress called for a re-examination of the interchange and surcharge fees that are charged for an ATM transaction. If regulation or legislation is passed regarding ATMs, it could limit the fees we receive from our ATMs, force us to replace and or stop operating our ATMs entirely or until such time compliance is achieved or require us to make substantial expenditures to be compliant with such regulation and could reduce our revenue or net income. In addition, the cost of compliance with applicable industry standards and the cost to implement software upgrades for our fleet of ATMs could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and if we are unsuccessful in our defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties may assert, including by means of counter-claims against us as a result of the assertion of our intellectual property rights, that our products, services or technology, or the operation of our business, violate their intellectual property rights. As the number of competitors in our industry increases and the functionality of technology offerings further overlap, such claims and counter-claims could become more common. We cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nAny intellectual property claim against us, regardless of its merit, could result in significant liabilities to our business. Depending on the nature of such claim, our business may be disrupted, our management\u2019s attention and other company resources may be diverted and we may be required to redesign our products and services or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the rights to use necessary technologies, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot redesign our products and services or license necessary technologies, we may be subject to the risk of injunctive relief and/or significant damage awards, which are complex, subjective and hard to predict, and subsequently we may not be able to offer or sell a particular product or service, or a family of products or services.\nAny intellectual property claim against us could be expensive and time consuming to defend. Insurance may not cover or be insufficient to fully cover such a claim, or may not be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we have an indemnification arrangement with a third-party to indemnify us against an intellectual property claim, such indemnifying party may not uphold its contractual obligations to us. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim that is brought against us is successful, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe terms of our credit agreement may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nOur credit agreement contains, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022make investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022transfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions;\n\u2022dispose of assets;\n\u2022pay dividends or make any other distributions with respect to our stock;\n\u2022issue stock, warrants, options or other rights to purchase stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of stock;\n\u2022engage in any material line of business substantially different from the lines of business we currently conduct or any business substantially related or incidental thereto; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of funding. We cannot be sure that such waivers, amendments or alternative sources of funding could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nOur credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain liquidity levels and satisfy certain financial ratios, including a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. A failure by us to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. An event of default would also occur under our credit agreement if we undergo a change of control or if we experience a material adverse change in our operations, condition or prospects. In the event of any default under our credit agreement, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these amounts. The acceleration of indebtedness under our credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe outsource critical operations, which exposes us to risks related to our third-party vendors, and we have begun to in-source certain technology functions, which exposes us to other risks.\nWe have entered into contracts with third-party vendors to provide critical services, technology and software in our operations. These outsourcing partners include: Fiserv, which provides back-end account and transaction data processing for OneAccounts; MasterCard, which provides the payment network for our debit MasterCard ATM cards, as well as for certain other transactions; and BMO Harris and Global Payments, which provide transaction processing and banking services for payment processing related to the SmartPay feature of our ePayment service and Ubiquity Global Services, which provides live-agent, chat and IVR services for the disbursements business, including the OneAccount. In the event that these service providers fail to maintain adequate levels of support, do not provide high quality service, discontinue their lines of business, terminate our contractual arrangements or cease or reduce operations, we may be required to pursue new third-party relationships, which could materially disrupt our operations and our ability to provide our products and services, and could divert management\u2019s time and resources. Replacement technology or services provided by replacement third-party vendors could be more expensive than those we have currently, while the process of transitioning services and data from one provider to another can be complicated and time consuming. If we are unable to complete a transition to a new provider on a timely basis, or at all, we could be forced to temporarily or permanently discontinue certain services, which could disrupt services to our customers and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to establish comparable new third-party relationships on as favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. With respect to the technology and operational support functions that we have in-sourced to date or that we seek to in-source, we may encounter difficulty or delays in developing and supporting an appropriate infrastructure to be able to perform these functions ourselves. We may also not realize the full value of our investments in these projects.\nBreaches of security measures, unauthorized access to or disclosure of data relating to our clients or student OneAccount holders, computer viruses or unauthorized software (malware), fraudulent activity, and infrastructure failures could materially and adversely affect our reputation or harm our business.\nIn recent years, companies that process and transmit cardholder information have been specifically and increasingly targeted by sophisticated criminal organizations in an effort to obtain the information and utilize it for fraudulent transactions. The encryption software and the other technologies we use to provide security for storage, processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information may not be effective to protect against data security breaches. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers.\nUnauthorized access to our computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft or publication of the information or the deletion or modification of sensitive records, and could cause interruptions in our operations. Any inability to prevent security breaches could damage our relationships with our merchant customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, expose us to liability for unauthorized purchases, and subject us to network fines. These claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices. Further, a significant data security breach could lead to additional regulation, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations. Any material increase in our costs resulting from litigation or additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, our higher education institution clients and student OneAccount holders disclose to us certain \u201cpersonally identifiable\u201d information, including student contact information, identification numbers and the amount of credit balances, which they expect we will maintain in confidence. It is possible that hackers, customers or employees acting unlawfully or contrary to our policies, or other individuals, could improperly access our or our vendors\u2019 systems and obtain or disclose data about our customers. Further, because customer data may also be collected, stored, or processed by third-party vendors, it is possible that these vendors could intentionally, negligently or otherwise disclose data about our clients or customers.\nWe rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems, databases, and infrastructure, and take reasonable steps to protect them. However, due to their size, complexity, content and integration with or reliance on third-party systems they are vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, natural disaster and random attack, all of which pose a risk of exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized persons or to the public.\nA cybersecurity breach of our information systems could lead to fraudulent activity such as identity theft, losses on the part of our banking customers, additional security costs, negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand. In addition, our customers could be subject to scams that may result in the release of sufficient information concerning themselves or their accounts to allow others unauthorized access to their accounts or our systems (e.g., \u201cphishing\u201d and \u201csmishing\u201d). Claims for compensatory or other damages may be brought against us as a result of a breach of our systems or fraudulent activity. If we are unsuccessful in defending against any resulting claims against us, we may be forced to pay damages, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, computer viruses or malware could infiltrate our systems, thus disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable. Although we utilize several preventative and detective security controls in our network, they may be ineffective in preventing computer viruses or malware that could damage our relationships with our merchant customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, or cause us to be in non-compliance with applicable network rules and regulations.\nIn addition, a significant incident of fraud or an increase in fraud levels generally involving our products could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use of our products and services. Such incidents could also lead to a large financial loss as a result of the protection for unauthorized purchases we provide to OneAccount customers given that we are liable to our Bank Partners for any uncollectable accountholder overdrafts and any other losses due to fraud or theft. Such incidents of fraud could also lead to regulatory intervention, which could increase our compliance costs. Compliance with the various complex laws and regulations is costly and time consuming, and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, increased regulatory requirements on our services may increase our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, account data breaches and related fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our future growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA disruption to our systems or infrastructure could damage our reputation, expose us to legal liability, cause us to lose customers and revenue, result in the unintentional disclosure of confidential information or require us to expend significant efforts and resources or incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data and security concerns. The harm to our business could be even greater if such an event occurs during a period of disproportionately heavy demand for our products or services or traffic on our systems or networks.\nWe maintain a significant amount of cash within our ATMs, which is subject to potential loss due to theft or other events, including natural disasters.\nAny loss of cash from our ATMs is generally our responsibility. We typically require that our service providers, who either transport the cash or otherwise have access to the ATM safe, maintain adequate insurance coverage in the event cash losses occur as a result of theft, misconduct or negligence on the part of such providers. Cash losses at the ATM could occur in a variety of ways, such as natural disaster (hurricanes, floods, etc.), fires, vandalism, and theft. While we maintain insurance policies to cover a significant portion of any losses that may occur that are not covered by the insurance policies maintained by our service providers, such insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of those losses. Any increase in the frequency and/or amounts of theft and other losses could negatively impact our operating results by causing higher deductible payments and increased insurance premiums.\nProviding disbursement services to higher education institutions is an uncertain business; if the market for our products does not continue to develop, we will not be able to grow this portion of our business.\nOur continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to generate revenues by providing financial transaction services to higher education institutions and their students. The market for these services has evolved and the long-term viability and profitability of this market is unproven. Our business will be materially and adversely affected if we do not develop and market products and services that achieve and maintain market acceptance. Outsourcing disbursement services may not become as widespread in the higher education industry as we anticipate, and our products and services may not achieve continued commercial success. In addition, higher education institution clients could discontinue using our services and return to in-house disbursement and payment solutions. If outsourcing disbursement services does not become as widespread as we anticipate or if higher education institution clients return to their prior methods of disbursement, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and a failure to maintain and develop our brand in a cost-effective manner may hurt our ability to expand our customer base.\nMaintaining and developing our brands is critical to expanding and maintaining our base of higher education institution clients and OneAccount holders. We believe the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Maintaining and developing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services at cost effective and competitive prices, as well as after-sale customer service. While we intend to continue investing in and updating our existing and new brands, we cannot predict the success of these investments. If we fail to maintain and enhance our existing and new brands, if our re-branding efforts are unsuccessful, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort or if our reputation is otherwise tainted, including by association with the wider financial services industry, we may be unable to maintain loyalty among our existing customers or attract new customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not continue to update and improve our existing products and services and develop new ones.\nThe industry for electronic financial transactions, including disbursement services, is generally subject to rapid and significant technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards, radio frequency and proximity payment devices (such as contactless cards), electronic commerce and mobile commerce. While we cannot predict how these technological changes will affect our business, we believe that disbursement services to the higher education industry will be subject to a similar degree of technological change and that new services and technologies for the industry will emerge in the medium-term. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. In addition, the products and services we develop may not be able to compete with the alternatives available to our customers. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.\nWe make substantial investments in improving our products and services, but we have no assurance that our investments will be successful. Our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected if we do not develop products and services that achieve broad market acceptance with our current and potential customers.\nOur business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to appropriately assess the risks in transactions.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, businesses, technologies, services, product lines and other assets, such as our acquisition of Sallie Mae\u2019s Campus Solutions division in May 2013. The successful integration of these businesses, or any business, technology, service, product line or other asset that we may acquire in the future, on a cost-effective basis, may be critical to our future performance. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with such integration, including: we may not be able to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies regarding the acquisition within the expected time-frames or at all and to successfully integrate the acquired business operations; such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; we may not be successful in converting new clients gained through acquisitions to our own products and services or in cross-selling our products and service to such clients; revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected; operating costs, client and customer loss and business disruption (including, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) may be greater than expected following the transaction; we may have difficulty retaining certain key employees in the acquired business; we may be subject to legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the acquisition agreement; and the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the acquisition may be greater than anticipated. If we do not successfully integrate a strategic acquisition, or if the benefits of a particular transaction do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts, the market price of our common stock may decline. Even if we successfully integrate assets or businesses we may acquire, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete and integrate an acquisition and the acquired business may not perform as we expect or enhance the value of our business as a whole.\nWe may be liable to our customers or lose customers if we provide poor service or if our systems or products experience failures.\nBecause of the large amount of data we collect and manage, hardware failures and errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain significant inaccuracies. For example, errors in our processing systems could delay disbursements or cause disbursements to be made in the wrong amounts or to the wrong person. Our systems may also experience service interruptions as a result of undetected errors or defects in our software, fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism, accident or other similar reason, in which case we may experience delays in returning to full service, especially with regard to our data centers and customer service call centers. If problems such as these occur, our customers may seek compensation, withhold payments, seek full or partial refunds, terminate their agreements with us or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures. In addition, we may be subject to claims made by third parties also affected by any of these problems.\nOur ability to limit our liabilities by contract or through insurance may be ineffective or insufficient to cover our future liabilities.\nWe attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages arising from our negligence, errors, mistakes or security breaches. Contractual limitations on liability, however, may not be enforceable or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages. For example, as we may be deemed by ED to be a third-party servicer to our higher education institution clients, we are required to agree to be held jointly and severally liable with our clients for violations of the federal regulations that govern the disbursement of financial aid refunds. Additionally, some of our public higher education institution clients are prohibited by state law from contractually indemnifying us for liability resulting from such violations. We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions. It is possible, however, that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nIf we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.\nOur business depends on certain registered and unregistered intellectual property rights and proprietary information. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and technical measures (such as the password protection and encryption of our data and systems) to protect our technology and intellectual property rights, including our proprietary software. Existing laws afford only limited protection for our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights or registrations granted to us may provide an inadequate competitive advantage to us or be too narrow to protect our products and services. Similarly, there is no guarantee that our pending applications for intellectual property protection will result in registrations or issued patents or sufficiently protect our rights. The protections outlined above may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of our intellectual property or technology and may not prevent our competitors from copying, infringing, or misappropriating our products and services. We cannot be certain that others will not independently develop, design around or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or intellectual property rights. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our business and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOne or more of our issued patents or pending patent applications may be categorized as so-called \u201cbusiness method\u201d patents. The general validity of software patents and business method patents has been challenged in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States. In 2010, the United States Supreme Court determined that a certain \u201cbusiness method\u201d amounting to abstract ideas was not patentable and in2014 the United States Supreme Court further held that implementing an abstract idea on a computer does not make it patent eligible. Although the Court\u2019s decision provides little guidance on patentability of our business methods, our patents could become less valuable or unenforceable if additional requirements are imposed that our patents do not meet.\nFrom time to time, we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties, such as through the litigation against TouchNet Information Systems, Inc. that we settled in 2015. See \u201cPart I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this report. The fact that we have intellectual property rights, including registered intellectual property, may not guarantee success in our attempts to enforce these rights against third parties. Our ability and potential success in enforcing our rights is also subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid, otherwise unenforceable, or are licensed to the party against whom we are asserting the claim. In addition, our assertions of intellectual property rights may result in the other party seeking to assert various claims against us, including its own alleged intellectual property rights, claims of unfair competition, or other claims. Furthermore, enforcing our intellectual property and other proprietary rights can be expensive. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive or less profitable to do business and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a holding company, our main source of cash is distributions from our operating subsidiaries.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our main cash source is dividends and other distributions from these subsidiaries. The ability of each subsidiary to make distributions depends on the funds that a subsidiary has from its operations in excess of the funds necessary for its operations, obligations or other business plans. If our operating subsidiaries are unable to make distributions, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy, unless we are able to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the event of a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation, there may not be assets sufficient for us to recoup our investment in the subsidiary.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Asset Sale, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect our business.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Asset Sale, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, our business or our relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, while the completion of the Asset Sale is pending we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and our management\u2019s focus and attention and employee resources may be diverted from operational matters.\nIn the event that the Asset Sale is not completed, the announcement of the termination of the Disbursements Asset Purchase Agreement may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, our business or our relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees.\nWe cannot be sure if or when the Asset Sale will be completed.\nThe consummation of the Asset Sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the authorization of the Asset Sale by our stockholders. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the Disbursement Asset Purchase Agreement will be satisfied. If we are unable to satisfy the closing conditions in Customers\u2019 favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, Customers will not be obligated to complete the Asset Sale.\nIf the Asset Sale is not completed, our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our stockholders, may evaluate other strategic alternatives that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to our stockholders as the Asset Sale. These may include retaining and operating the Disbursements Business or pursuing an alternate sale transaction that would yield reduced consideration or involve significant delays. Any future sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company or other transactions may be subject to further stockholder approval.\nIf we do not complete the Asset Sale, we cannot be sure that we will receive the cooperation of Customers should we attempt to sell the Disbursements Business to another purchaser.\nIf we do not complete the Asset Sale and instead seek to sell the Disbursements Business to another purchaser, Customers, in its capacity as a current bank partner of the Company, would need to cooperate in the transition of the Disbursements Business to such purchaser (including, in particular, the transition of student accounts). We cannot be sure that such cooperation would be forthcoming, potentially hindering our ability to sell the Disbursements Business to another purchaser.\nWe may undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d), which could affect our ability to offset gains, if any, realized in the Asset Sale against our net operating losses and certain of our tax credit carryovers.\nSection 382 of the Code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating losses and tax credits existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of a company\u2019s stock within a rolling three-year period. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company.\nIf we were to undergo one or more \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, our net operating losses and certain of our tax credits existing as of the date of each ownership change may be unavailable, in whole or in part, to offset gains, if any, from the Asset Sale. If we are unable to offset fully for U.S. federal income tax purposes gains, if any, realized in respect of the Asset Sale with our tax loss carry-forwards, we may incur U.S. federal income tax liability.\nOne of our executive officers may have interests in the Asset Sale other than, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.\nOne of our executive officers may have interests in the Asset Sale that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. Our Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Asset Purchase Agreement.\nBecause the Disbursements Business represented approximately 59% of our gross revenues for fiscal year 2015, our business following the Asset Sale will be substantially different.\nThe Disbursements Business represented approximately 59% of our gross revenues for the fiscal year 2015. Following the consummation of the Asset Sale, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we fail to effectively reduce our overhead costs to reflect the reduced scale of our operations or we fail to grow our Other Businesses. Our smaller size may result in the recognition of less revenues from the operations of our Other Businesses, which may negatively affect our overall net earnings.\nIf the Asset Sale disrupts our business operations and prevents us from realizing intended benefits, our business may be harmed.\nThe Asset Sale may disrupt the operation of our business and prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of the Asset Sale as a result of a number of obstacles, such as the loss of key employees, customers or business partners, the failure to adjust or implement our business strategies, additional expenditures required to facilitate the Asset Sale transaction, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations.\nThe Asset Sale may not be completed or may be delayed if the conditions to closing are not satisfied or waived.\nThe Asset Sale may not be completed or may be delayed because the conditions to closing, including approval of the transaction by our stockholders and consents from certain third parties, may not be satisfied or waived. If the Asset Sale is not completed, we may have difficulty recouping the costs incurred in connection with negotiating the Asset Sale, our relationships with our clients, customers, suppliers and employees may be damaged, and our business may be harmed.\nThe announcement of the Asset Sale may harm our business.\nAs a result of our announcement of the Asset Sale, third parties may be unwilling to enter into material agreements with respect to the Disbursements Business or our Other Businesses. New or existing clients, customers and business partners may prefer to enter into agreements with our competitors who have not expressed an intention to sell their business because clients, customers and business partners may perceive that such new relationships are likely to be more stable. Additionally, employees working in the Disbursements Business may become concerned about the future of the Disbursements Business and lose focus or seek other employment.\nIf we fail to complete the Asset Sale, our business may be harmed.\nIf we fail to complete the Asset Sale, the failure to maintain existing business relationships or enter into new ones could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition including, but not limited to the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its bank partner relationships and contract with new bank partners to the extent necessary. If we fail to complete the Asset Sale and we retain the Disbursements Business, we will consider alternatives including, but not limited to, an orderly shut-down of the Disbursements Business. The potential for loss or disaffection of employees or customers of the Disbursements Business following a failure to consummate the Asset Sale could have a material, negative impact on the value of our business.\nIn addition, if the Asset Sale is not consummated, our directors, executive officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction, and we will have incurred significant third party transaction costs, in each case, without any commensurate benefit, which may have a material and adverse effect on our stock price and results of operations.\nThe Disbursement Asset Purchase Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Asset Sale.\nThe Disbursement Asset Purchase Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell the Disbursements Business to any party other than Customers. These provisions include the prohibition on our ability to solicit competing proposals and the requirement that we pay a termination fee of $1,500,000 if the Disbursement Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances. These provisions could make it less advantageous for a third party that might have an interest in acquiring the Company or all of or a significant part of the Disbursements Business to consider or propose an alternative transaction, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the consideration to be paid by Customers.\nBecause our business will be smaller following the sale of the Disbursements Business, there is a possibility that our common stock may be delisted from New York Stock Exchange if we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of that market.\nEven though we currently satisfy the continued listing standards for the New York Stock Exchange, following the sale of the Disbursements Business our business will be smaller and, therefore, we may fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. In the event that we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, our common stock may be delisted from that market. Any delisting of our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders. In addition, delisting of our common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the future we may sell businesses, technologies, services, product lines and other assets.\nDivestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nreductions of our revenues or earnings per share;\n\u2022\nunanticipated liabilities, legal risks and costs;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management from our ongoing business; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of a divestiture.\nBecause divestitures are inherently risky, transactions we undertake may not be successful and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 93418, "SIC": 6099, "TIC": "ONE.2"}
