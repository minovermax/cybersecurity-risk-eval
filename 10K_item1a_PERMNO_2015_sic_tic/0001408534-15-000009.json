{"cik": "1408534", "company": "First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. - Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves substantial risks. You should carefully consider, among other matters, the factors set forth below as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether an investment in shares of our common stock is suitable for you. If any of the risks described herein develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nAdverse events in Louisiana, where our business is concentrated, could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.\nOur business, the location of our branches and the real estate used as collateral on our real estate loans are primarily concentrated in Louisiana. At December 31, 2014, approximately 75.6% of the secured loans in our loan portfolio were secured by real estate and other collateral located in Louisiana. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The occurrence of an economic downturn in Louisiana, or adverse changes in laws or regulations in Louisiana could impact the credit quality of our assets, the businesses of our customers and our ability to expand our business. Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing in our market area. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may be negatively affected.\nMaterial fluctuations in the price of oil and gas could adversely affect our business. At December 31, 2014, approximately $21.3 million, or 2.7% of our total loan portfolio was comprised of loans to businesses engaged in support or service activities for oil and gas operations. We had $12.1 million in unfunded commitments related to these businesses. In addition, the market value of the real estate securing loans as collateral could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions. Adverse developments affecting commerce or real estate values in the local economies in our primary market areas could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. In addition, substantially all of our loans are to individuals and businesses in Louisiana. Our business customers may not have customer bases that are as diverse as businesses serving regional or national markets. Consequently, any decline in the economy of our market area could have an adverse impact on our revenues and financial condition. In particular, we may experience increased loan delinquencies, which could result in a higher provision for loan losses and increased charge-offs. Any sustained period of increased non-payment, delinquencies, foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in our market area could adversely affect the value of our assets, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a significant number of loans secured by real estate, and a downturn in the local real estate market could negatively impact our profitability.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 66.5% of our total loan portfolio was secured by real estate, almost all of which is located in Louisiana. As a result of the severe recession in 2008 and 2009, real estate values nationally and in our Louisiana markets declined. Recently, real estate values both nationally and in our market areas have shown improvement. Future declines in the real estate values in our Louisiana markets could significantly impair the value of the particular collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower\u2019s obligations to us. This could require increasing our allowance for loan losses to address the decrease in the value of the real estate securing our loans which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur loan portfolio consists of a high percentage of loans secured by non-farm non-residential real estate. These loans carry a greater credit risk than loans secured by one- to four-family properties.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-farm non-residential real estate loans, primarily loans secured by commercial real estate such as office buildings, hotels and retail facilities. At December 31, 2014, our non-farm non-residential loans totaled $328.4 million, or 41.5% of our total loan portfolio. Our non-farm non-residential real estate loans expose us to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than one- to four-family family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation and income stream of the borrowers. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a one- to four-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. In addition, non-farm non-residential real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential loans. Accordingly, charge-offs on non-farm non-residential loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. An unexpected adverse development on one or more of these types of loans can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans secured by receivables, inventory, equipment or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAt December 31, 2014, $196.3 million, or 24.8% of our total loans, was comprised of commercial and industrial loans to businesses collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and generally backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. These commercial and industrial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial and industrial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, or may be difficult to market and sell, exposing us to increased credit risk. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets, resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our loan portfolio consists of syndicated loans, including syndicated loans known as shared national credits, secured by assets located generally outside of our market area. Syndicated loans may have a higher risk of loss than other loans we originate because we are not the lead lender and we have limited control over credit monitoring.\nOver the last seven years, we have pursued a focused program to participate in select syndicated loans (loans made by a group of lenders, including us, who share or participate in a specific loan) with a larger regional financial institution as the lead lender. Syndicated loans are typically made to large businesses (which are referred to as shared national credits) or middle market companies (which do not meet the regulatory definition of shared national credits), both of which are secured by business assets or equipment, and commercial real estate located generally outside of our market area. The syndicate group for both types of loans usually consists of two to three other financial institutions. At December 31, 2014, we had $129.0 million in syndicated loans, or 16.3% of our total loan portfolio with our largest individual syndicated loan totaling $8.8 million. At December 31, 2014, shared national credit loans totaled $76.9 million, or 9.7% of our total loan portfolio. In addition at December 31, 2014, we had $52.1 million in syndicated loans that were not shared national credits. Syndicated loans may have a higher risk of loss than other loans we originate because we rely on the lead lender to monitor the performance of the loan. Moreover, our decision regarding the classification of a syndicated loan and loan loss provisions associated with a syndicated loan are made in part based upon information provided by the lead lender. A lead lender also may not monitor a syndicated loan in the same manner as we would for other loans that we originate. If our underwriting of these syndicated loans is not sufficient, our non-performing loans may increase and our earnings may decrease.\nCurtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect a segment of our business, and government agencies may not honor their guarantees if we do not originate loans in compliance with their guidelines.\nAs of December 31, 2014, $27.0 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio, were comprised of loans where all or some portion of the loans were guaranteed through the SBA, USDA or Farm Security Administration (\u201cFSA\u201d) lending programs, and we intend to grow this segment of our portfolio in the future. From time to time, the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal limits and cease to guarantee loans. In addition, these agencies may change their rules for loans or Congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the loan programs. Non-governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers, but the terms might not be equally acceptable. Therefore, if these changes occur, the volume of loans to small business, industrial and agricultural borrowers of the types that now qualify for government guaranteed loans could decline. Also, the profitability of these loans could decline.\nIn addition, while we follow the SBA\u2019s, USDA\u2019s and FSA\u2019s underwriting guidelines, our ability to do so depends on the knowledge and diligence of our employees and the effectiveness of controls we have established. If our employees do not follow the SBA, USDA or FSA guidelines in originating loans and if our loan review and audit programs fail to identify and rectify such failures, the government agencies that guarantee these loans may refuse to honor their guarantee obligations and we may incur losses as a result.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income, or the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes.\nWhen interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nWhile we attempt to invest a significant percentage of our assets in loans (our loan to deposit ratio was 57.6% at December 31, 2014), we invest a large portion of our total assets (42.2% at December 31, 2014) in investment securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, generating an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements of our public funds deposits and meeting regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2014, the book value of our securities portfolio was $641.6 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPublic funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits.\nPublic funds deposits are a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At December 31, 2014, $601.5 million, or 43.9% of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities such as school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and other municipalities, which are collateralized by letters of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) and investment securities. Given our dependence on high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could significantly and adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily demand deposit accounts or short-term time deposits and are therefore more sensitive to interest rate risks. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net income.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe have selectively acquired financial institutions over the past ten years, and we intend to continue pursuing a strategy that includes acquisitions. An acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nfinding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u25cf\nattracting funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances;\n\u25cf\nmaintaining asset quality;\n\u25cf\nretaining customers and key personnel;\n\u25cf\nobtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nconducting adequate due diligence and managing known and unknown risks and uncertainties;\n\u25cf\nintegrating acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition candidates that fit our strategy and standards. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized. Acquisitions will be subject to regulatory approvals, and we may be unable to obtain such approvals. Acquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, and acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire and to realize our attempts to eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that they would otherwise be able to direct toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market trading values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition of a financial institution or service company, and the carrying amount of any goodwill that we acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain and manage our growth.\nContinued growth depends, in part, upon the ability to expand market presence, to successfully attract core deposits, and to identify attractive commercial lending opportunities. Management may not be able to successfully manage increased levels of assets and liabilities. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loan balances, which may adversely impact our efficiency, earnings and shareholder returns. In addition, franchise growth may increase through acquisitions and de novo branching. The ability to successfully integrate such acquisitions into our consolidated operations will have a direct impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend primarily on net interest income for our earnings rather than noninterest income.\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our operating income. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our net interest income totaled $44.1 million in comparison to our total non-interest income of $6.2 million earned during the same year. We do not rely on nontraditional sources of fee income utilized by some community banks, such as fees from sales of insurance, securities or investment advisory products or services. The amount of our net interest income is influenced by the overall interest rate environment, competition, and the amount of interest-earning assets relative to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities. In the event that one or more of these factors were to result in a decrease in our net interest income, we have limited sources of non-interest income to offset any decrease in our net interest income.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2014, our non-performing assets, which consist of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, were $15.0 million, or 0.99% of total assets. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways:\n\u25cf\nwe record interest income only on the cash basis or cost-recovery method for nonaccrual loans and we do not record interest income for other real estate owned;\n\u25cf\nwe must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses;\n\u25cf\nnon-interest expense increases when we write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values;\n\u25cf\nthere are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees; and\n\u25cf\nthe resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activities.\nIf additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our non-performing assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nLoan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. We may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio are made, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the loans and the loss and delinquency experience and evaluates economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income, was 1.15% and as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 71.2%. The determination of the appropriate level of allowance is subject to judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. If assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio at the date of the financial statements. Significant additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income. Non-performing loans may increase and non-performing or delinquent loans may adversely affect future performance. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any significant increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEmphasis on the origination of short-term loans could expose us to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2014, $639.9 million, or 81.0% of our total loans consisted of short-term loans, defined as loans whose payments are typically based on ten to 20-year amortization schedules but have maturities typically ranging from one to five years. This results in our borrowers having significantly higher final payments due at maturity, known as a \u201cballoon payment.\u201d In the event our borrowers are unable to make their balloon payments when they are due, we may incur significant losses in our loan portfolio. Moreover, while the shorter maturities of our loan portfolio help us to manage our interest rate risk, they also increase the reinvestment risk associated with new loan originations. During an economic slow-down, we might incur significant losses as our loan portfolio matures.\nWe rely on our management team and our board of directors for the successful implementation of our business strategy.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued service and skills of our senior management team and our board of directors, particularly Marshall T. Reynolds, our Chairman, Alton B. Lewis, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Eric J. Dosch, our Chief Financial Officer. The implementation of our business and growth strategies also depends significantly on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executives and directors. The loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a negative impact on our business because of their skills, years of industry experience and difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our noninterest revenue through service charges on core deposit accounts, and regulations impacting service charges could reduce our fee income.\nA significant portion of our noninterest revenue is derived from service charge income. During the year ended December 31, 2014, service charges, commissions and fees represented $4.4 million, or 71.8% of our total noninterest income. The largest component of this service charge income is overdraft-related fees. Management believes that changes in banking regulations pertaining to rules on certain overdraft payments on consumer accounts have and will continue to have an adverse impact on our service charge income. Additionally, changes in customer behavior, as well as increased competition from other financial institutions, may result in declines in deposit accounts or in overdraft frequency resulting in a decline in service charge income. A reduction in deposit account fee income could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete with others for business.\nThe area in which we operate is considered attractive from an economic and demographic viewpoint, and is a highly competitive banking market. We compete for loans and deposits with numerous regional and national banks and other community banking institutions, as well as other kinds of financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers and private lenders. Many competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. The differences in resources may make it harder for us to compete profitably, reduce the rates that we can earn on loans and investments, increase the rates we must offer on deposits and other funds, and adversely affect our overall financial condition and earnings.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather conditions in Louisiana can have an adverse impact on our market area.\nOur market area in Southeast Louisiana is close to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico, areas which are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms and other natural disasters and adverse weather conditions. For example, Hurricane Katrina hit the greater New Orleans area in August 2005 causing widespread damage. Similar future events could potentially cause widespread property damage, require the relocation of an unprecedented number of residents and business operations, and severely disrupt normal economic activity in our market areas, which may have an adverse effect on our operations, loan originations and deposit base. Moreover, our ability to compete effectively with financial institutions whose operations are not concentrated in areas affected by hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions or whose resources are greater than ours will depend primarily on our ability to continue normal business operations following such event. The severity and duration of the effects of hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions will depend on a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including the amount and timing of government, private and philanthropic investments including deposits in the region, the pace of rebuilding and economic recovery in the region and the extent to which a hurricane\u2019s property damage is covered by insurance. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nOur ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as we expand. Similar to other large corporations, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events. As discussed below, we are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of our technology systems. Additionally, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.\nWe continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third party providers of such platforms into its existing businesses.\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOur businesses are dependent on their ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of our client base and our geographical reach, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber-attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nChanges in accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting policies are essential to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which may result in our restating our prior period financial statements.\nWe hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future. If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings and the book values of these assets would decrease.\nWe are required to test goodwill and core deposit intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and financial performance. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment which would adversely affect our financial performance.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of our investment securities, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. As stated above, public funds are a sizeable portion of our deposits. Loss of a large public funds depositor at the end of a contract would negatively impact liquidity.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the FHLB or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFederal Reserve Bank\u201d). We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in our target markets or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock we issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with the SBLF may be dilutive to your stock ownership in First Guaranty Bancshares.\nThe ownership interest of your common stock may be diluted to the extent we need to raise capital by issuing securities to redeem the 39,435 shares of Series C Preferred Stock we sold to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the SBLF. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, our shareholders bear the risk of our future offerings related to redeeming the Series C Preferred Stock, including reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting shareholders\u2019 holdings in our common stock. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nThe dividend rate on our Series C Preferred Stock will increase to 9.0% if we have not redeemed the Series C Preferred Stock on or prior to March 22, 2016, which will impact net income available to holders of our common stock and earnings per share of our common stock.\nThe per annum dividend rate on the shares of our Series C Preferred Stock was 1.0% per annum at December 31, 2014. Beginning on March 22, 2016, the per annum dividend rate on the Series C Preferred Stock will increase to a fixed rate of 9.0% if any Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding. At the current dividend rate of 1.0% per annum, the total dividend paid on our Series C Preferred Stock is $394,350. Assuming the increased dividend rate of 9.0% per annum and assuming we have not redeemed any of our Series C Preferred Stock, the annual dividend payable on our Series C Preferred Stock would be $3.5 million. Depending on our financial condition at the time, any such increase in the dividend rate could have a material negative effect on our financial condition, including reducing our net income available to holders of our common stock and our earnings per share.\nFailure to pay dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock may have negative consequences, including limiting our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock issued in connection with our participation in the SBLF pays a non-cumulative quarterly dividend in arrears. Such dividends are not cumulative but we may only declare and pay dividends on our common stock (or any other equity securities junior to the Series C Preferred Stock) if we have declared and paid dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock for the current dividend period.\nMoreover, our ability to pay dividends is always subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors could further reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Like other bank holding companies and financial institutions, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. Under these laws, we are required, among other things, to enforce a customer identification program and file currency transaction and suspicious activity reports with the federal government. Government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws or make required reports.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d), the FDIC and the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions (\u201cOFI\u201d), periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to any regulatory actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nFinancial reform legislation enacted by Congress will, among other things, tighten capital standards and result in new laws and regulations that likely will increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. This law significantly changed the then-existing bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the regulatory structure to which we are subject in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nthe base for FDIC insurance assessments has been changed to a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base, while the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise insurance premiums has been expanded;\n\u25cf\nthe current standard deposit insurance limit has been permanently raised to $250,000;\n\u25cf\nthe FDIC must raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to \u201coffset the effect\u201d of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10.0 billion;\n\u25cf\nthe interchange fees payable on debit card transactions have been limited;\n\u25cf\nthere are multiple new provisions affecting corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly traded companies; and\n\u25cf\nall federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on commercial demand deposit accounts have been repealed.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards, as well as with respect to certain mortgage-related matters, such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and prepayment penalties.\nOur management continues to assess the impact on our operations of the Dodd-Frank Act and its regulations, some of which have yet to be proposed or adopted or are to be phased-in over time. Because the full impact of many of the regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time, it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us. However, it is expected that at a minimum our operating and compliance costs will increase, and our interest expense could increase.\nWe will become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to First Guaranty Bancshares, on a consolidated basis, and First Guaranty Bank, on a stand -alone basis. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective for First Guaranty Bancshares and First Guaranty Bank on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for First Guaranty Bank and First Guaranty Bancshares could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we are unable to comply with such requirements.\nWe are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the United States Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the industry in which we operate.\nIf capital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption as they did during the recent financial crisis, we may face the following risks:\n\u25cf\nincreased regulation of our industry;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities;\n\u25cf\nmarket developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could affect our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Competition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial institutions in connection with the current market conditions;\n\u25cf\nmarket disruptions make valuation even more difficult and subjective, and our ability to measure the fair value of our assets could be adversely affected. If we determine that a significant portion of our assets have values significantly below their recorded carrying value, we could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter in which such determination was made, our capital ratios would be adversely affected and a rating agency might downgrade our credit rating or put us on credit watch; and\n\u25cf\nthe downgrade of the United States government\u2019s sovereign credit rating, any related rating agency action in the future, and the downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings for several European nations could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the policies of the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve Board include open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, particularly in light of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks and the current military operations in the Middle East, we cannot predict possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or our business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the United States government and other governments in responding to such terrorist attacks or the military operations in the Middle East may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.\nFuture legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our rights against borrowers.\nFuture legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our rights against borrowers in the event of their default on their outstanding loan obligations. There have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution\u2019s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral. If proposals such as these or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor were to be implemented, we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing its remedies as a creditor.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC insurance premiums or additional special assessments that could adversely affect our earnings. A bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. Recent insured depository institution failures, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions generally, have significantly increased the losses of the FDIC, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio of the FDIC to historical lows. To restore this reserve ratio and bolster its funding position, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on depository institutions and also increased deposit insurance assessment rates. In the event of bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC insurance premiums. Any future increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk Associated with an Investment in our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is established between a buyer and seller.\nFirst Guaranty Bank acts as the transfer agent for First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. The price for all shares traded are agreed upon by buyers and sellers. There is no active or liquid market for our common stock. First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. is not traded on an exchange, therefore liquidation and/or purchases of stock may not be readily available.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessary in relation to our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact our business.\nOur Management and Directors control a substantial percentage of our common stock and therefore has the ability to exercies substantial control over our affairs.\nBecause of the large percentage of common stock held by our directors and executive officers, such persons could significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders even if other shareholders were in favor of a different result.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends.\nAlthough First Guaranty Bancshares, and First Guaranty Bank prior to the Share Exchange, paid a quarterly dividend to our shareholders for 86 consecutive quarters at December 31, 2014, we have no obligation to continue paying dividends, and we may change our dividend policy at any time without prior notice to our shareholders. In addition, our ability to pay dividends will continue to be subject, among other things, to certain regulatory guidance and/or restrictions.", "PERMNO": 15840, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FGBI"}
