{"cik": "1011509", "company": "Golden Minerals Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nInvestors in Golden Minerals should consider carefully, in addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors:\nWe have historically incurred operating losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect to incur operating losses and operating cash flow deficits through 2016; our potential profitability in the foreseeable future would depend on our ability to identify, acquire and mine properties to generate sufficient revenues to fund our continuing activities.\nWe have a history of operating losses and we expect that we will continue to incur operating losses unless and until such time as our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, our El Quevar project, or another of our exploration properties, which may include the Santa Maria Mine, the San Luis del Cordero project, or the Rodeo property, generates sufficient revenue to fund our continuing business activities. In the fourth quarter 2015 we shut down the mines at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties due to our inability to establish profitability with current mining methods at current prices, and borrowed $5.0 million from an investment fund managed by The Sentient Group, our largest stockholder, to fund cash deficits. Although we have leased the oxide plant at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties to a subsidiary of Hecla Mining Company, the cash that we expect will be generated from that lease will be insufficient to fund all of our continuing business activities as currently conducted. In addition, the oxide plant lease may terminate sooner or produce less revenue than we anticipate if Hecla experiences mining problems or delays at its nearby mine, if there are disputes between Hecla and us, or for other reasons. There is no assurance that we will develop additional sources of revenue.\nIn addition, the potential profitability of mining and processing at any of our properties would be based on a number of assumptions. For example, profitability would depend on metal prices, costs of materials and supplies, costs at the mines and processing plants and the amounts and timing of expenditures, including expenditures to maintain our El Quevar project and to continue exploration at other exploration properties, and potential strategic acquisitions or other transactions, in addition to other factors, many of which are and will be beyond our control. We cannot be certain we will be able to generate sufficient revenue from any source to achieve profitability and eliminate operating cash flow deficits, or to cease to require additional funding.\nWe will require additional external financing to fund our continuing business activities in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. If Sentient converts the remaining $1.1 million Sentient Loan plus accrued interest into shares of our common stock, and assuming we receive approximately $4.8 million from the oxide plant lease in 2016, we expect that our current cash and cash equivalent balance would be depleted to approximately $0.5 million by the end of 2016. If Sentient does not convert the remaining $1.1 million Sentient Loan plus accrued interest into shares of our common stock, we will require external funding to repay the loan. In addition, the oxide plant lease may terminate sooner or produce less revenue than we anticipate if Hecla experiences mining problems or delays at its nearby mine, if there are disputes between Hecla and us, or for other reasons. Even with cash generated by the oxide plant lease, and assuming that the remaining principal and interest under the Sentient Note is fully converted into shares of our common stock, our cash balance in 2016 may not be sufficient to pursue further exploration of our properties in Mexico or cover costs required to start mining and processing at any of those properties, requiring us to seek additional funding from equity or debt, from monetization of non-core assets or from other business transactions or combinations.\nWe do not have a credit, off-take or other commercial financing arrangement in place that would finance our general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities in the future, and we believe that securing credit for these purposes may be difficult given our limited history and the continuing volatility in global credit and commodity markets. In addition, commercial financing arrangements may not be available on favorable terms or on terms that would not further restrict our flexibility and ongoing ability to meet our cash requirements over a reasonable period of time. Access to public\nfinancing has been negatively impacted by the volatility in the credit markets and metals prices, which may affect our ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future and, if obtained, to do so on favorable terms. We also may not be able to obtain funding by monetizing additional non-core exploration or other assets at an acceptable price. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing to fund our general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we commence mining in Mexico, we will likely enter into a collective bargaining agreement with a union that, together with labor and employment regulations, could adversely affect our mining activities and financial condition.\nAs was the case at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, mine employees in Mexico are typically represented by a union, and our relationship with our employees was, and we expect in the future will be, governed by collective bargaining agreements. Any collective bargaining agreement that we enter into with a union is likely to restrict our mining flexibility in and impose additional costs on our mining activities. In addition, relations between us and our employees in Mexico may be affected by changes in regulations or labor union requirements regarding labor relations that may be introduced by the Mexican authorities or by labor unions. Changes in legislation or in the relationship between us and our employees may have a material adverse effect on our mining activities and financial condition.\nWe may not mine the Velarde\u00f1a Properties again.\nIn mid-November 2015, we shut down the mines and sulfide processing plant at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties and placed them on care and maintenance. Commencing mining again is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 whether we are able to create mine plans or gold recovery improvements that can achieve sustainable cash positive results at current and future metals prices;\n\u00b7 unexpected events, including difficulties in maintaining the properties on a care and maintenance basis, potential sabotage or damage to the assets related to the suspension of mining, and variations in ore grade and relative amounts, grades and metallurgical characteristics of oxide and sulfide ores;\n\u00b7 continued decreases or insufficient increases in gold and silver prices to permit us to achieve sustainable cash positive results;\n\u00b7 actual holding and care and maintenance costs resulting from the shutdown exceeding current estimates or including unanticipated costs;\n\u00b7 loss of and inability to adequately replace skilled mining and management personnel;\n\u00b7 strikes or other labor problems; and\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain additional funding for general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities as currently conducted and possibly for a potential restart of our Velarde\u00f1a Properties.\nBased on these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that we will restart mining activities at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties.\nOur ability to successfully conduct mining and processing activities resulting in long-term cash flow and profitability will be affected by changes in prices of silver, gold and other metals.\nOur ability to successfully conduct mining and processing activities in Mexico, Argentina or other countries, to establish reserves and advance our exploration properties, and to become profitable in the future, as well as our long-term viability, depend, in large part, on the market prices of silver, gold, zinc, copper and other metals. The market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 global or regional consumption patterns;\n\u00b7 supply of, and demand for, silver, gold, zinc, lead, copper and other metals;\n\u00b7 speculative activities and hedging activities;\n\u00b7 expectations for inflation;\n\u00b7 political and economic conditions; and\n\u00b7 supply of, and demand for, consumables required for extraction and processing of metals.\nThe declines in silver and gold prices in 2013, 2014 and 2015 have had a significant impact on our mining activities, resulting in shutdowns in 2013 and 2015 of mining at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, and negatively affect mining opportunities at our other properties. Additionally, future weakness in the global economy could increase volatility in metals prices or depress metals prices, which could also affect our mining and processing plans at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties or make it uneconomic for us to engage in mining or exploration activities. Volatility or sustained price declines may also adversely affect our ability to build or continue our business.\nProducts processed from our Velarde\u00f1a Properties or other mines could contain higher than expected contaminants, thereby negatively impacting our financial condition.\nIn 2015 we processed mined material to make gold and silver bearing lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates. Concentrate treatment charges paid to smelters and refineries include penalties for certain elements, including arsenic and antimony that exceed contract limits. It is possible that our concentrates will contain higher amounts of these elements than we anticipate. This can occur due to unexpected variations in the occurrence of these elements in the material mined, problems that occur during blending of material from various locations in the mine prior to processing and other unanticipated events. In the future, if our concentrates include higher than expected contaminants, we would incur higher treatment expenses and penalty charges, which could increase our costs and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our business combination with ECU, we have assumed all historical ECU liabilities, some of which are known or which may become known by Golden Minerals.\nIn September 2011, we completed a business combination with ECU, which at that time owned the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. As a result of this transaction, we are subject to the environmental, contractual, tax and other obligations and liabilities of ECU, some of which may be unknown. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all obligations and liabilities related to the historical business of ECU. These liabilities, and other liabilities related to ECU\u2019s business not currently known to us or that prove to be more significant than we currently anticipate, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Velarde\u00f1a Properties, the El Quevar project and our other properties may not contain mineral reserves.\nWe are considered an exploration stage company under SEC Industry Guide 7, and none of the properties at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, the El Quevar project, or any of our other properties have been shown to contain proven or probable mineral reserves. Expenditures made in mining at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties or the exploration and advancement of our El Quevar project or other properties may not result in positive cash flow or in discoveries of commercially recoverable quantities of ore. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits, and we cannot assure you that any mineral deposit we identify will qualify as an orebody that can be legally and economically exploited or that any particular level of recovery from discovered mineralization will in fact be realized.\nTetra Tech completed a technical report on our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, which indicated the presence of mineralized material, and RungePincockMinarco completed a technical report on our El Quevar property, which indicated the presence of mineralized material. Mineralized material figures based on estimates made by geologists are inherently imprecise and depend on geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling that may prove to be unreliable or inaccurate. We cannot assure you that these estimates are accurate or that proven and probable mineral reserves will be identified at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, El Quevar or any of our other properties. Even if the presence of reserves is established at a project, the economic viability of the project may not justify exploitation. We have spent significant amounts on the evaluation of El Quevar prior to establishing the economic viability of that project.\nEstimates of reserves, mineral deposits and mining costs also can be affected by factors such as governmental regulations and requirements, fluctuations in metals prices or costs of essential materials or supplies, environmental factors, unforeseen technical difficulties and unusual or unexpected geological formations. In addition, the grades of ore or material ultimately mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results, sampling, feasibility studies or technical reports. Short-term factors relating to reserves, such as the need for orderly development of ore bodies or the processing of new or different grades, may also have an adverse effect on\nmining and on the results of operations. Silver, gold or other minerals recovered in small-scale laboratory tests may not be duplicated in large-scale tests under on-site processing conditions.\nThe Velarde\u00f1a Properties, the El Quevar project and our other properties are subject to foreign environmental laws and regulations which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have conducted mining activities in Mexico and conduct mineral exploration activities primarily in Mexico. Mexico and Argentina, where our El Quevar project is located, have laws and regulations that control the exploration and mining of mineral properties and their effects on the environment, including air and water quality, mine reclamation, waste generation, handling and disposal, the protection of different species of flora and fauna and the preservation of lands. These laws and regulations require us to acquire permits and other authorizations for conducting certain activities. In many countries, there is relatively new comprehensive environmental legislation, and the permitting and authorization process may not be established or predictable. We may not be able to acquire necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in acquiring any permit or authorization could increase the cost of our projects and could suspend or delay the commencement of extraction and processing of mineralized material.\nOur Velarde\u00f1a Properties are subject to regulation by SEMARNAT, the environmental protection agency of Mexico. In order to permit new facilities at or expand existing facilities, regulations require that an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a Manifestaci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental, be prepared by a third-party contractor for submission to SEMARNAT. Studies required to support the Manifestaci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental include a detailed analysis of soil, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The Manifestaci\u00f3n is then published on SEMARNAT\u2019s web page and in its official gazette in a national and local newspaper. The Manifestaci\u00f3n is discussed at various open hearings, including hearings in the local communities, at which third parties may voice their views. We would be required to provide proof of local community support of the Manifestaci\u00f3n as a condition to final approval. We may not be able to obtain community support of future projects.\nEnvironmental legislation in Mexico is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. For example, in January 2011, Article 180 of the Mexican Federal General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection was amended. Among other things, this amendment extended the term during which an individual or entity having a legitimate interest may contest administrative acts, including environmental authorizations, permits or concessions granted, without the need to demonstrate the actual existence of harm to the environment, natural resources, flora, fauna or human health, making it sufficient to argue that harm may be caused. Further, the amendment permits the contesting party to challenge a Manifestaci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental through a variety of administrative or court procedures. As a result of the amendment, more legal actions supported or sponsored by non-governmental groups interested in halting projects may be filed against companies operating in all industrial sectors, including the mining sector. Mexican operations are also subject to the environmental agreements entered into by Mexico, the United States and Canada in connection with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Further, in August 2011, certain amendments to the Civil Federal Procedures Code of Mexico (\u201cCFPC\u201d) were published in the Official Daily of the Federation. The amendments establish three categories of collective actions by which 30 or more people claiming injury resulting from, among other things, environmental harm, will be deemed to have a sufficient and legitimate interest in seeking, through a civil procedure, restitution, economic compensation or suspension of the activities from which the alleged injury derived. These amendments to the CFPC may result in more litigation by plaintiffs seeking remedies for alleged environmental harms, including suspension of the activities alleged to cause harm. Future changes in environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where the Velarde\u00f1a Properties are located may adversely affect our business, make our business prohibitively expensive, or prohibit it altogether.\nEnvironmental legislation in many other countries, in addition to Mexico, is evolving in a manner that will likely require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. For example, in September 2010, the Argentine National Congress passed legislation which prohibits mining activity in glacial and surrounding areas. Although we do not currently anticipate that this legislation will impact the El Quevar project, the legislation provides an example of the evolving environmental legislation in the areas in which we operate. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may (i) necessitate significant capital outlays, (ii) cause us to delay, terminate or otherwise change our intended activities with respect to one or more projects, or (iii) materially adversely affect our future exploration activities.\nThe Velarde\u00f1a Properties and many of our exploration properties are located in historic mining districts where prior owners, including ECU in the case of the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, may have caused environmental damage that may not be known to us or to the regulators. At the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and in most other cases, we have not sought complete environmental analyses of our mineral\nproperties. We have not conducted comprehensive reviews of the environmental laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which we own or control mineral properties. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and mining) is not generally available. To the extent environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we currently hold interests, or may hold interests in the future, that are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by us, or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally, and to the extent we are subject to environmental requirements or liabilities, the cost of compliance with these requirements and satisfaction of these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to fully fund the cost of remediation of any environmental condition, we may be required to suspend activities or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remediation.\nIn addition, U.S. or international legislative or regulatory action to address concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could negatively impact our business.\nTitle to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other properties and rights may be defective or may be challenged.\nOur policy is to seek to confirm the validity of our rights to, title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral property in which we have a material interest. However, we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is not available for our mineral properties, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure rights to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Accordingly, the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. In addition, we may be unable to conduct activities on our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties, and the title to our mineral properties may also be impacted by state action. We have not conducted surveys of all of the exploration properties in which we hold direct or indirect interests and, therefore, the precise area and location of these exploration properties may be in doubt.\nIn most of the countries in which we operate, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners. Any such loss, reduction or imposition of partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUnder the laws of Mexico, mineral resources belong to the state, and government concessions are required to explore for or exploit mineral reserves. Mineral rights derive from concessions granted, on a discretionary basis, by the Ministry of Economy, pursuant to the Mexican mining law and regulations thereunder. We hold title to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other properties in Mexico through these government concessions, but there is no assurance that title to the concessions comprising the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and other properties will not be challenged or impaired. The Velarde\u00f1a Properties and other properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims, and title may be affected by undetected defects. There could be valid challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Velarde\u00f1a Properties that, if successful, could impair mining with respect to such properties in the future. A defect could result in our losing all or a portion of our right, title, and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.\nOur Velarde\u00f1a Properties mining concessions and our other mining concessions in Mexico may be terminated if our obligations to maintain the concessions in good standing are not satisfied, including obligations to explore or exploit the relevant concession, to pay any relevant fees, to comply with all environmental and safety standards, to provide information to the Ministry of Economy and to allow inspections by the Ministry of Economy. In addition to termination, failure to make timely concession maintenance payments and otherwise comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in reduction or expropriation of entitlements. Additionally, in 2014, new mining concessions became subject to additional review and approval by the Mexico Ministry of Energy.\nMining concessions in Mexico give exclusive exploration and exploitation rights to the minerals located in the concessions but do not include surface rights to the real property, which requires that we negotiate the necessary agreements with surface landowners. Many of our mining properties are subject to the Mexican ejido system requiring us to contract with the local communities surrounding the properties in order to obtain surface rights to land needed in connection with our mining exploration activities. In connection with our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, we have contracts with two ejidos to secure surface rights with a total annual cost of approximately $25,000. The first contract is a ten-year contract with the Velarde\u00f1a ejido, which provides surface rights to certain roads and other infrastructure at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties through 2021. The second contract is a 25-year contract with the Vista Hermosa ejido signed in March 2013, which provides exploration access and access rights for roads and utilities for our Velarde\u00f1a Properties. Our inability to maintain and periodically renew or expand these surface rights on favorable terms or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMining and processing activities are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining activities.\nMining and processing at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, as at most mines, requires significant amounts of water. At the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, our ability to have sufficient water is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims. Water is provided for all of the mines comprising our Velarde\u00f1a Properties by wells located in the valley adjacent to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. We hold title to three wells located near the sulfide plant and hold certificates of registration to three wells located near the oxide plant. We are licensed to pump water from all six wells up to a permitted amount. We are currently only using water from the three wells associated with the oxide plant. We are required to make annual payments to the Mexican government to maintain our rights to these wells. We are required to pay a fine to the Mexican Government each year if we use too much water from a particular well or alternatively if we do not use a minimum amount of water from a particular well. In addition to these fines, the Mexican Government reserves the right to cancel our title to the wells for abuse of these rules.\nWe currently have a sufficient amount of water for the third party processing activities at the oxide plant. However, if we began processing material from both the sulfide and oxide plants in the future, we may face shortages in our water supply, and therefore will need to obtain water from outside sources at higher costs. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our wells, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights would require us to seek water from outside sources at higher costs and could require us to curtail or shut down mining and processing in the future. Laws and regulations may be introduced in the future which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in mining activities, thus adversely affecting our business.\nThere are significant hazards involved in underground mining and processing activities at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, not all of which are fully covered by insurance. To the extent we must pay the costs associated with such risks, our business may be negatively affected.\nThe mining and processing of the underground mines at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, as well as the conduct of our exploration programs that frequently require rehabilitation of and drilling in underground mine workings, are subject to numerous risks and hazards, including, but not limited to, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations, formation pressures, cave-ins, underground fires or floods, power outages, labor disruptions, seismic activity, rock bursts, accidents relating to historical workings, landslides and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or processing facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced extraction and processing and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance against risks inherent in the conduct of our business in amounts that we consider reasonable, this insurance contains, as in the case of our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, exclusions and limitations on coverage, and will not cover all potential risks associated with mining and exploration activities, and related liabilities might exceed policy limits. As a result of any or all of the forgoing, particularly if the facilities are older, we could incur significant liabilities and costs that could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nOur Velarde\u00f1a Properties and most of our exploration properties are located in Mexico and are subject to various levels of political, economic, legal and other risks.\nOur Velarde\u00f1a Properties are located in Mexico, and, as such, are exposed to various levels of political, economic, legal and other risks and uncertainties, including local acts of violence, such as violence from drug cartels; military repression; extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labor unrest; the risks of war or civil unrest; expropriation and nationalization; renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts; illegal mining; acts of political corruption; changes in taxation policies; restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; and changing political conditions, currency controls and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nIn the past, Mexico has been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, which have resulted in changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Mexico\u2019s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required funding for our Velarde\u00f1a Properties or other projects in Mexico in the future.\nOur Mexican properties are subject to a variety of governmental regulations governing health and worker safety, employment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection of endangered and protected species, purchase, storage and use of explosives and other matters. Specifically, our activities related to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties are subject to regulation by SEMARNAT, the Comision Nacional del Agua, which regulates water rights, and Mexican mining laws. Mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards.\nOur Velarde\u00f1a Properties and mineral exploration activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to our mining and exploration activities or the maintenance of our properties. For example, in January 2014, amendments to the Mexico federal corporate income tax law require titleholders of mining concessions to pay annually a 7.5% duty of their mining related profits and a 0.5% duty on revenues obtained from the sale of gold, silver and platinum that were effective March 2015. These additional duties applicable to Mexico mining concession titleholders will have a significant impact on the annual costs applicable to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties if we have mining related profits or significant revenues in the future.\nChanges, if any, in mining or investment policies, changes or increases in the legal rights of indigenous populations or in the difficulty or expense of obtaining rights from them that are necessary for our Velarde\u00f1a Properties or shifts in political attitude may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our mining and exploration activities may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to restrictions on extraction, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, income and other taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. Restart of mining or use of both the oxide and sulfide plant may also require us to assure the availability of adequate supplies of water and power, which could be affected by government policy and competing businesses in the area. The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our mining and exploration activities and financial condition.\nFuture changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact current or planned exploration or mining activities at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties or in respect of any of our other projects in Mexico or with which we become involved in Mexico. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption of mining and exploration or material fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nMost of our costs are subject to exchange control policies, the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso.\nOur revenue and external funding are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, mining, processing, maintenance and exploration costs at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and most of our exploration properties are denominated principally in Mexican pesos. These costs principally include electricity, labor, water, maintenance, local contractors and fuel. When inflation in Mexico increases without a corresponding devaluation of the Mexican peso, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. The annual inflation rate in Mexico was 2.1% in 2015, 4.1% in 2014 and 4.0% in 2013. At the same time, the peso has been subject to significant fluctuation, which may not have been proportionate to the inflation rate and may not be proportionate to the inflation rate in the future. The value of the peso decreased by 17% in 2015, decreased by 13% in 2014 and decreased by 0.6% in 2013. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance that the Mexican government will maintain its current policies with regard to the peso or that the peso\u2019s value will not fluctuate significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that currency fluctuations, inflation and exchange control policies will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, earnings and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to obtain all of our required governmental permits or obtain property rights on favorable terms or at all, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFuture mining and current processing at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, the continued evaluation of the El Quevar project and other exploration activities will require additional permits from various governmental authorities. Our business is and will continue to be governed by laws and regulations governing mining, exploration, prospecting, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, mining royalties and other matters. We may also be required to obtain certain property rights to access or use our properties. Obtaining or renewing licenses and permits, and acquiring property rights, can be complex and time-consuming processes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, and that such terms will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that the issuance of such licenses, permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties. Delays in obtaining or a failure to obtain any licenses, permits or property rights or any required extensions; challenges to the issuance of licenses, permits or property rights, whether successful or unsuccessful; changes to the terms of licenses, permits or property rights; or a failure to comply with the terms of any licenses, permits or property rights that have been obtained could have a material adverse effect on our business by delaying, preventing or making future mining and processing at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties and other continued processing activities economically unfeasible. U.S. or international legislative or regulatory action to address concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could also negatively impact our business. While we will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations regarding such matters, we currently believe that the impact of such legislation on our business will not be significant.\nWe own our interest in the San Diego exploration property in Mexico in a 50-50 joint venture and are therefore unable to control all aspects of exploration and advancement of this property.\nWe hold the San Diego exploration property in Mexico in a 50-50 joint venture with Golden Tag Resources Ltd., which, until March 2017, has a right to acquire an additional 10% interest by making expenditures related to further exploration drilling and completing an updated resource assessment at the property. Our interest in the San Diego property is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures. A disagreement between joint venture partners on how to conduct business efficiently, the inability of joint venture partners to meet their obligations to the joint venture or third parties, or litigation arising between joint venture partners regarding joint venture matters could have a material adverse effect on the viability of our interests held through the joint venture. For example, in 2009, ECU received a notice of arbitration from Golden Tag Resources Ltd. The dispute was settled in September 2010 and resulted in an increase in ECU\u2019s mining property costs of approximately $61,000. Additionally, if Golden Tag Resources Ltd. exercises its right to acquire an additional 10% interest, our ability to control exploration and advancement will be further reduced.\nWe depend on the services of key executives.\nOur business strategy is based on leveraging the experience and skill of our management team. We are dependent on the services of key executives, including Warren Rehn and Robert Vogels. Due to our relatively small size, the loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to manage and succeed in our mining and exploration activities.\nThe exploration of our mineral properties is highly speculative in nature, involves substantial expenditures and is frequently non-productive.\nMineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and is frequently non-productive. Substantial expenditures are required to:\n\u00b7 establish mineral reserves through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques;\n\u00b7 determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to process metal from the ore;\n\u00b7 determine the feasibility of mine development and production; and\n\u00b7 construct, renovate or expand mining and processing facilities.\nIf we discover a deposit or ore at a property, it usually takes several years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible. During this time, the economic feasibility of a project may change because of increased costs, lower metal prices or other factors. As a result of these uncertainties, we may not successfully acquire additional mineral rights, or our exploration programs may not result in proven and probable reserves at all or in sufficient quantities to justify developing the El Quevar project or any of our exploration properties.\nThe decisions about future advancement of exploration projects may be based on feasibility studies, which derive estimates of mineral reserves, operating costs and project economic returns. Estimates of economic returns are based, in part, on assumptions about future metal prices and estimates of average cash operating costs based upon, among other things:\n\u00b7 anticipated tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;\n\u00b7 anticipated recovery rates of silver and other metals from the ore;\n\u00b7 cash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and\n\u00b7 anticipated climatic conditions.\nActual cash operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those anticipated by our studies and estimates.\nLack of infrastructure could forestall or prevent further exploration and advancement.\nExploration activities, as well as any advancement activities, depend on adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important factors that affect capital and operating costs and the feasibility and economic viability\nof a project. Unanticipated or higher than expected costs and unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, or government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exploration activities are in countries with developing economies and are subject to the risks of political and economic instability associated with these countries.\nWe currently conduct exploration activities almost exclusively in countries with developing economies, including Argentina and Mexico. These countries and other emerging markets in which we may conduct business have from time to time experienced economic or political instability. We may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with conducting exploration activities in countries with developing economies, including:\n\u00b7 political instability and violence;\n\u00b7 war and civil disturbance;\n\u00b7 acts of terrorism or other criminal activity;\n\u00b7 expropriation or nationalization;\n\u00b7 changing fiscal, royalty and tax regimes;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 high rates of inflation;\n\u00b7 uncertain or changing legal requirements respecting the ownership and maintenance of mineral properties, mines and mining activities, and inconsistent or arbitrary application of such legal requirements;\n\u00b7 underdeveloped industrial and economic infrastructure;\n\u00b7 corruption; and\n\u00b7 unenforceability of contractual rights.\nChanges in mining or investment policies or shifts in the prevailing political climate in any of the countries in which we conduct exploration activities could adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct our business in countries that may be adversely affected by changes in the local government\u2019s policies toward or laws governing the mining industry.\nWe have exploration activities primarily in Mexico and Argentina. In these regions there exist uncertainties regarding future changes in applicable law related to mining and exploration. For instance, in January 2014, amendments to the Mexico federal corporate income tax law require titleholders of mining concessions to pay annually a 7.5% duty of their mining related profits and a 0.5% duty on revenues obtained from the sale of gold, silver and platinum that were effective March 2015. These additional duties applicable to Mexico mining concession titleholders will have a significant impact on the annual costs applicable to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties if we have mining related profits or significant revenues in the future.\nAdditionally, effective January 2015, the Argentina National Mining Code was amended, increasing the annual canon payment by approximately four times. In 2014 and 2015, our annual canon fees payable to the Argentine government was $35,000 and $74,000 respectively, and we expect to pay approximately $114,000 in 2016.\nFurthermore, as a result of the termination of a bilateral tax treaty among Spain and Argentina (terminated January 2013), certain beneficial tax treatment arising from equity ownership between our Spain and Argentina subsidiaries was eliminated. Consequently, we recorded a liability of approximately $21,500 as of December 31, 2015 and could be liable for up to an additional approximately $0.3 million stemming from unpaid interest equity tax for years 2009 through 2012 plus fines.\nIn addition to the risk of increased transaction costs, we do not maintain political risk insurance to cover losses that we may incur as a result of nationalization, expropriation or similar events in Mexico or Argentina where we explore or have mining and processing activities.\nWe compete against larger and more experienced companies.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive. Many large mining companies are primarily makers of precious or base metals and may become interested in the types of deposits on which we are focused, which include silver, gold and other precious metals deposits or polymetallic deposits containing significant quantities of base metals, including zinc, lead and copper. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, experience and technical capabilities than we do. We may encounter increasing competition from other mining companies in our efforts to acquire mineral properties and hire experienced mining professionals. Increased competition in our business could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable mining properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, which are subject to certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business. Any significant breakdown, invasion, virus, cyber attack, security breach, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact our business. To the extent any invasion, cyber attack or security breach results in disruption to our business, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, we may suffer such losses in the future. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nIf we default on the Sentient Loan, Sentient will have the right to foreclose on the stock of subsidiaries holding our Velarde\u00f1a Properties and the El Quevar project and exercise other remedies.\nIn October 2015, pursuant to a senior secured convertible note (the \u201cSentient Note\u201d), we borrowed $5.0 million (the \u201cSentient Loan\u201d) from a fund managed by The Sentient Group. On February 11, 2016, Sentient converted approximately $3.9 million of principal plus $0.1 million accrued interest under the Sentient Loan into 23,355,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of approximately $.17 per share. Upon conversion, Sentient holds approximately 49% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. After conversion, approximately $1.1 million principal amount under the Sentient Note remains outstanding and due at maturity on October 27, 2016.\nThe Sentient Loan is secured by the stock of the Company\u2019s principal subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are holding companies for or directly own the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and the El Quevar project. In addition, these and other subsidiaries have guaranteed the Sentient Loan. Under the related loan agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), our failure to comply with other covenants typical of such loan agreements, or to pay principal and interest when due would also result in an event of default under the Loan Agreement. If we were unable to cure defaults, Sentient could accelerate the maturity of the Sentient Note, foreclose on the stock of subsidiaries holding our principal assets, and take action to enforce guarantees against certain of our subsidiaries.\nWe do not currently have sufficient funds to pay the remaining principal and interest on the Sentient Loan and may not have sufficient funds to do so prior to the scheduled maturity of the Sentient Loan. As a result of exercising its remedies in the event of a default, Sentient could acquire directly or indirectly the Company\u2019s principal assets, which would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe issued a significant number of shares of common stock upon the partial conversion of the Sentient Note and may issue a significant number of additional shares of common stock upon total conversion of the Sentient Note, which could significantly dilute our existing stockholders and depress the market price of our common stock.\nOn February 11, 2016, Sentient converted approximately $3.9 million of principal plus $0.1 million accrued interest under the Sentient Loan into 23,355,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of approximately $.17 per share. Upon conversion of the Sentient Note, Sentient remains the Company\u2019s largest stockholder, holding approximately 49% or 37,578,734 shares of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock, which totals 76,690,333 shares of common stock outstanding after conversion. After conversion, approximately $1.1 million principal amount under the Sentient Note remains outstanding and due at maturity on October 27, 2016.\nSentient has the right to convert the remaining principal and accrued interest under the Sentient Note at a conversion price equal to the lowest of (i) $0.29, equal to 90 percent of the 15-day volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of our Common Stock for the period immediately preceding the loan closing date, (ii) 90 percent of the 15-day VWAP for the period immediately preceding the loan conversion date, or (iii) an anti-dilution adjusted price based on the lowest price for which the Company has sold its stock following the borrowing date (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Sentient Note). If Sentient converts the remaining amount of principal and interest due at the loan maturity date, estimated at approximately $1.2 million, at $0.29, Sentient would own approximately 55% of the Company\u2019s then outstanding common stock, assuming no other issuances of common stock. A lower stock price prior to the conversion date or the effects of an anti-dilution adjustment in the Sentient Note could further reduce the conversion price significantly, and significantly increase the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion, and Sentient\u2019s resulting ownership percentage.\nThe common stock issuable upon conversion of the Sentient Note may represent overhang that may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of the company\u2019s stock typically decreases, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market further decrease the share price. $.29 is the highest price at which the Sentient Note may be converted. Decreases in our stock price below $0.29 have the effect of decreasing the conversion price and increasing the number of shares to be issued on conversion, which could further decrease our stock price. A significant increase in the number of our outstanding shares resulting from conversion of the Sentient Note could exert downward pressure on the market price for our common stock and would significantly dilute the voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nWhether or not Sentient converts the remaining principal and interest due under the Sentient Note, we will require additional funding to support our business, including for general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities as currently conducted. Because debt financing is difficult to obtain for early-stage mining companies, it is likely that we will seek such financing in the equity markets. If we were to engage in any type of equity financing, the current ownership interest of our stockholders would be diluted.\nThe issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Sentient Note resulted in a change of control.\nAs a result of the February 2016 loan conversion described above, Sentient\u2019s ownership increased from 27% to 49% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. If Sentient converts the remaining amount of principal and interest due at the loan maturity date, estimated at approximately $1.2 million, at $0.29, Sentient would own approximately 55% of the Company\u2019s then outstanding common stock, assuming no other issuances of common stock. The ownership increase to 49% effectively resulted in a change of control of the Company. With this increased ownership, Sentient could exert significant control over the Company, including over the election of directors, changes in the size or the composition of the board of directors, and mergers and other business combinations involving the Company. Through control of the board of directors and increased voting power, including an ability to prevent a quorum at stockholders meetings, Sentient could control certain decisions, including decisions regarding qualification and appointment of officers, operations of the business including acquisition or disposition of our assets or purchases and sales of mining or exploration properties, dividend policy, and access to capital (including borrowing from third-party lenders and the issuance of equity or debt securities).\nThe existence of a significant number of warrants may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with our financing in September 2014, we issued warrants to acquire 4,746,000 shares of our common stock at $1.21 per share expiring in September 2019. In connection with our financing in September 2012, we issued five year warrants to purchase 3,431,649 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8.42 per share expiring September 2017. Pursuant to a weighted average dilution calculation based on the pricing in the September 2014 financing, the exercise price for the September 2012 warrants was reduced to $7.17 and the number of shares issuable on exercise of the warrants increased to 4,031,409. As a result of the Sentient conversion on February 11, 2016, pursuant to the weighted average dilution calculation in the 2012 and 2014 warrants, (i) the exercise price for the September 2012 warrants was further reduced to $5.09 and the number of shares issuable on exercise of the warrants increased to 5,677,757, and (ii) the exercise price for the September 2014 warrants was reduced to $0.91 and the number of shares issuable on exercise of the warrants increased to 5,365,983. The existence of securities available for exercise and resale is referred to as an \u201coverhang,\u201d and, particularly if the warrants are \u201cin the money,\u201d the anticipation of potential sales could exert downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to meet the maintenance criteria of the NYSE MKT may result in the delisting of our common stock, which could result in lower trading volumes and liquidity, lower prices of our common shares and make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, and we are subject to its continued listing requirements, including maintaining certain share prices and a minimum amount of shareholders equity. The market price of our common stock has been recently and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuation. If we are unable to comply with the NYSE MKT continued listing requirements, including its trading price requirements, our common stock may be suspended from trading on and/or delisted from the NYSE MKT. Alternatively, in order to avoid delisting by the NYSE MKT, we may be required to effect a reverse split of our common stock. Although we have not been notified of any delisting proceedings, there is no assurance that we will not receive such notice in the future or that we will be able to then comply with NYSE MKT listing standards. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE MKT may materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer could find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing on the NYSE MKT, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. These factors could significantly negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital.", "PERMNO": 93285, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "AUMN"}
