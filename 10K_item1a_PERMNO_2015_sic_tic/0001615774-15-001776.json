{"cik": "1491419", "company": "LOTON, CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Form 10-K. The following risks relate principally to our business, which we acquired on April 28, 2014, and our common stock. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe own 50% of KOKO.\nWe own 50% of the shares of capital stock of OCHL. OCHL is the sole owner of OCL which owns and operates KOKO. As 50% owner of OCHL, we have the right to appoint half of the members of the board of directors of OCHL and, as a result of the OCHL Shareholders Agreement, as amended, of OCL as well. Following the Merger, the Board of OCHL is comprised of Mr. Ellin and Mr. Bengough and both manage pursuant to the terms of the OCHL Shareholders\u2019 Agreement and the Variation Agreement. Pursuant to the OCHL Shareholder Agreement discussed above under the heading \u201cThe OCHL Shareholder Agreement,\u201d and the Variation Agreement, discussed above under the heading \u201cVariation to Shareholder\u2019s Agreement,\u201d we are subject to shared control of OCHL and thus of KOKO with regard to the management of KOKO so long as the OCHL Shareholder Agreement and the Variation Agreement are in effect and the Company controls 50% or less of the shares of capital stock of OCHL. In the absence of holding a majority of voting rights, neither we nor the other owner of 50% of OCHL, Mr. Bengough, can unilaterally implement decisions pertaining to the operation or disposition of KOKO.\nPursuant to the Variation Agreement, Mr. Bengough has agreed, promptly following the closing of the Merger, subject to Mr. Bengough\u2019s receipt of satisfactory tax clearances under the tax laws of the United Kingdom, and entry into mutually acceptable documentation, to transfer all shares of OCHL held by him to KoKo UK with the result that OCHL would become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. There is no assurance that Mr. Bengough will obtain such satisfactory tax clearances and will close on the exchange agreement to transfer his shares of OCHL to KoKo UK. Since Mr. Bengough has failed to close on the exchange agreement to transfer his shares of OCHL to KoKo UK, the Company will continue to co-operate OCHL with Mr. Bengough and seek expansion through other means such as acquisition of other live concert or event or media companies, licensing opportunities and hiring skilled personnel in the concert venue, media and night-club operations industries. The Company may not be able to fully leverage its strategies or to direct the expansion of the KOKO brand or enter into licensing or promotional arrangements, or to exploit the KOKO venue, without the consent of Mr. Bengough.\nOur business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to maintain our attractiveness and reputation.\nOur business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on our ability to maintain the attractiveness of our venue and reputation as a place where shows can be successfully promoted and performed.\nOur business depends on relationships between key promoters, executives, agents, managers, artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships, as executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists, agents, promoters and managers in order to secure the rights to live music performances and events which are critical to our success. Due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business, the loss of any of OCL\u2019s or our officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business. We can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts, including musical artists.\nSimilarly, OCL depends upon the Mint Group for management services including oversight of operational, financial and marketing activities. OCL\u2019s contract with the Mint Group is of one year duration. It is generally renewed each year but there is no assurance that at the end of any given one-year term, it will be renewed. If it were not renewed, OCL would have to hire employees or enter a contract with a different service provider. There is no assurance that OCL would be able to do so successfully or within a time period that would not have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnother important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with third-party distribution channels, advertisers, sponsors and service providers. Any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the live music industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition. The live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists, and, in the markets in which we promote music concerts; we face competition from other promoters and venue operators. Our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours. These competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists. Our competitors may develop services, advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nOther variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, leading to decreases in overall revenue, the number of sponsors, event attendance, ticket prices and fees or profit margins include:\n\u00b7 unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u00b7 competitors\u2019 offerings that may include more favorable terms than we offer in order to obtain agreements for new venues or ticketing arrangements or to obtain events for the venues they operate;\n\u00b7 technological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer, which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events;\n\u00b7 other entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions which could cause our consumers to reduce discretionary spending;\n\u00b7 unfavorable changes in labor conditions which may require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees; and\n\u00b7 unfavorable shifts in population and other demographics which may cause us to lose audiences as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence, or which may cause sponsors to be unwilling to pay for sponsorship and advertising opportunities if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective.\nWe have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses.\nWe incurred a net loss of $5.2 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. We may face reduced demand for our live music events, our streaming platform and related services and other factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. We cannot predict whether we will achieve and maintain profitability in future periods.\nOur success depends, in significant part, on entertainment and leisure events and factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income. In addition, during past economic slowdowns and recessions, many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures. The impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict, but they may result in reductions in sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue. The risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment and leisure events.\nOur business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. Many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment, fuel prices, interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results. Business conditions, as well as various industry conditions, including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels, can also significantly impact our operating results. These factors can affect attendance at our events, premium seat sales, sponsorship, advertising and hospitality spending, concession and merchandise sales, as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues, events and the industry. Negative factors such as challenging economic conditions, public concerns over terrorism and security incidents, particularly when combined, can impact corporate and consumer spending, and one negative factor can impact our results more than another. There can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions, or by any further or future deterioration in economic conditions, thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth.\nWe may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities. In the event of future acquisitions, we could, among other things:\n\u2022 use a significant portion of our available cash;\n\u2022 issue equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022 incur substantial debt;\n\u2022 incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown;\n\u2022 incur amortization expenses related to intangibles; and\n\u2022 incur large accounting write-offs.\nSuch actions by us could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOCL currently operates in the London market, but we plan to expand internationally which may expose us to risks not found doing business in the United Kingdom.\nOCL currently provides services in the United Kingdom but we expect to expand our presence internationally. We expect to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations, including:\n\u00b7 political instability, adverse changes in diplomatic relations and unfavorable economic conditions in our current market and in new markets into which we may expand;\n\u00b7 more restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulation of the music and live entertainment industries, which could result in increased compliance costs and/or otherwise restrict the manner in which we provide services and the amount of related fees charged for such services;\n\u00b7 limitations on the ability of foreign subsidiaries to repatriate profits or otherwise remit earnings;\n\u00b7 adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7 any failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties;\n\u00b7 operating in foreign countries subjects us to risk from currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7 expropriations of property and risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u00b7 diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 lower levels of internet usage, credit card usage and consumer spending in comparison to those in the United Kingdom; and\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing operations and adapting to consumer desires due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with (i) business practices and customs that are common in certain foreign countries but might be prohibited by U.S. or British law and our internal policies and procedures, and (ii) management and operational systems and infrastructures, including internal financial control and reporting systems and functions, staffing and managing of foreign operations, which we might not be able to do effectively, or if so, on a cost-efficient basis.\nSince Mr. Bengough has failed to close on the exchange agreement to transfer his shares of OCHL to KoKo UK, the Company will need to seek expansion through other means such as acquisition of other live concert or event or media companies, seeking out licensing opportunities and hiring skilled personnel in the concert venue, media and night-club operations industries.\nIf the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term, significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period.\nOCL and/or LXL may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties.\nOCL and/or LXL may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties. We regard our and OCL/LXL\u2019s intellectual property rights, including service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property (as applicable) as critical to our success.\nOCL and LXL rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, domain names, or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require legal action to correct. In addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties.\nOCL and LXL have generally registered and continue to apply to register, or secure by contract when appropriate, our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used. OCL and LXL consider the protection of their trademarks and service marks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation. While OCL and LXL vigorously protect their trademarks, service marks and domain names, effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which OCL and LXL may operate, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. As we expand internationally, we may become aware of third parties in other jurisdictions that already own prior rights to the KOKO and LiveXLive trademarks. Depending on the circumstances, we may deem it appropriate, for instance, to acquire a license or a consent from any such prior mark owners, or we may determine to operate under a different mark in that jurisdiction. Also, OCL and LXL have generally also registered and continue to reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate. Not every variation of a domain name may be available, however, or OCL or LXL may determine not to register it, even if available. Our or OCL\u2019s or LXL\u2019s failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations.\nBecause we own, through OCL, assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations, we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.\nThere is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with OCL\u2019s live music events, which could subject us or OCL to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses, as well as reduce attendance at OCL\u2019s live music events, causing a decrease in our revenue.\nThere are inherent risks involved with producing live music events. As a result, personal injuries and accidents have, and may, occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries. Incidents in connection with OCL\u2019s live music events at any of our venues could also result in claims, reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events, which could cause a decrease in our revenue. While we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient, in management\u2019s judgment, to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at OCL\u2019s venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances.\nActivities or conduct, such as illegal drug use, at OCL\u2019s properties or the events OCL produces may expose OCL to liability, cause OCL to lose business licenses or government approvals, result in the cancellation of all or a part of an event or result in adverse publicity.\nOCL is subject to risks associated with activities or conduct, such as drug use at our events or venue that are illegal or violate the terms of our OCL\u2019s business licenses. Illegal activities or conduct at any of our events or venue may result in negative publicity, adverse consequences (including illness, injury or death) to the persons engaged in the illegal activity or others, and litigation against us. OCL has developed policies and procedures aimed at ensuring that the operation of each event is conducted in conformance with local, state and federal laws. Additionally, OCL has a \u2018\u2018no tolerance\u2019\u2019 policy on illegal drug use in or around its facilities, and OCL continually monitors the actions of entertainers, fans and our employees to ensure that proper behavioral standards are met. However, such policies, no matter how well designed and enforced, cannot provide absolute assurance that the policies\u2019 objectives are achieved. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems and policies, there can be no assurance that our policies will prevent deliberate acts by persons attempting to violate or circumvent them. The consequences of these acts may increase our costs, result in the loss or termination of the lease for OCL\u2019s venue by the property owner, result in our inability to get the necessary permits and locations for our events, or lead to the cancellation of all or part of an event. These consequences may also make it more difficult for OCL to obtain or retain sponsorships, lower consumer demand for OCL\u2019s events, subject OCL to liability claims, divert management\u2019s attention from OCL\u2019s business and make an investment in our securities unattractive to current and potential investors. These outcomes could have the effect of lowering our revenue, profitability and/or our stock price.\nCosts associated with, and our ability to obtain, adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nHeightened concerns and challenges regarding property, casualty, liability, business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weather-related conditions and incidents. As a result, OCL may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable rates, including coverage for acts of terrorism and weather-related property damage. OCL has a material investment in property and equipment at its existing venue and may have material investments at future venues, which are located in or near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans.\nThese operational, geographical and situational factors, among others, may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable. OCL cannot assure that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact its profitability, thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth.\nWe cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits, including insurance coverage for property, casualty, liability and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism, would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues, or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages. We cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available, offered at reasonable rates, or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness. The occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting our existing venue or any one or more of our future venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and/or company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages.\nCosts associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nGrowth or maintenance of OCL\u2019s existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in its venue. Therefore, OCL expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet long-term increasing demand, value and revenue. OCL frequently may have a number of significant capital projects underway. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond OCL\u2019s control, may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements, including:\n\u00b7 availability of financing on favorable terms;\n\u00b7 advances in technology and related changes in customer expectations;\n\u00b7 unforeseen changes in design;\n\u00b7 increases in the cost of materials, equipment and labor;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\n\u00b7 litigation, accidents or natural disasters;\n\u00b7 national or regional economic changes; and\n\u00b7 additional venue acquisition costs.\nThe amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year. In addition, actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials, equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change. Construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which, if changed, could materially affect the ultimate cost.\nOCL is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOCL\u2019s operations are subject to national statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures, both domestically and internationally, which are subject to change at any time, governing matters such as:\n\u00b7 construction, renovation and operation of our venues;\n\u00b7 licensing and planning laws, including those relating to noise, security and playing copyrighted music and sound recordings;\n\u00b7 human health, safety and sanitation requirements;\n\u00b7 the service of food and alcoholic beverages;\n\u00b7 working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, immigration and employment laws;\n\u00b7 compliance with the DDA, DDR and regarding any operations in the US, the ADA;\n\u00b7 listed building regulation;\n\u00b7 compliance with United States FCPA, the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries;\n\u00b7 advertising regulation;\n\u00b7 hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental protection laws;\n\u00b7 sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;\n\u00b7 privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information;\n\u00b7 marketing activities via post, telephone, text and online; and\n\u00b7 the timely filing of corporate documentation with the Company Registrar (including in relation to financial accounts).\nOCL\u2019s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While OCL attempts to conduct its business and operations in a manner that it believes to be in compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to OCL\u2019s current understanding of the law or regulation. In addition, the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nUnfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur results may be affected by the outcome of any future litigation. Unfavorable rulings in future legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings. In addition, from time to time in the future we may be subject to various claims, investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings (whether civil or criminal) or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties, as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor. If the results of these investigations, proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third-party lawsuits, we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or counterclaim, we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur primary strategy for the growth of LXL is dependent upon our ability to acquire and develop live music festival streaming rights, and any inability to fund the significant up-front cash requirements associated with our live music streaming platform could result in the inability to secure and retain such festival rights.\nIn order to secure live music festival streaming rights, we are often required to advance cash to the festival promoter prior to the sale of any advertising or sponsorships or for that festival. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or available capacity to advance the necessary cash for any given festival, we would not be able to retain the rights for that festival and our live music streaming business would be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to develop and grow LXL\u2019s user base, or if ad engagement on our platform declines, our revenue, business and operating results may be harmed.\nThe size of LXL\u2019s user base is critical to our success. LXL will need to develop and cultivate a strong user base. We expect to generate revenue based upon subscription fees from our users and ads that we display. If people do not perceive our products and services to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract users to subscribe to our services and/or increase the frequency of their engagement with our platform and the ads that we display. A number of consumer-oriented websites that achieved early popularity have since seen their user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our user base. A number of factors could potentially negatively affect user growth and engagement, including if:\n\u00b7 users engage with other products, services or activities as an alternative to ours;\n\u00b7 influential users, such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets and brands or certain age demographics conclude that an alternative product or service is more relevant;\n\u00b7 we are unable to convince potential new users of the value and usefulness of our products and services;\n\u00b7 there is a decrease in the perceived quality of our content;\n\u00b7 we fail to introduce new and improved products or services or if we introduce new or improved products or services that are not favorably received or that negatively affect user engagement;\n\u00b7 technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products or services in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, including issues with connecting to the Internet;\n\u00b7 users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products or services on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\n\u00b7 users believe that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, relevance and prominence of ads that we display;\n\u00b7 there are user concerns related to privacy and communication, safety, security or other factors;\n\u00b7 there are adverse changes in our products or services that are mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees;\n\u00b7 we fail to provide adequate customer service to users; or\n\u00b7 we do not maintain our brand image or our reputation is damaged.\nIf we are unable to develop and grow our user base, or if these metrics decline, our products and services could be less attractive to potential new users, as well as to advertisers and platform partners, which would have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf LXL is unable to compete effectively for users and advertiser spend, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nCompetition for users of LXL\u2019s products and services is intense. Although LXL is developing a new platform for streaming live music events in real time, LXL faces strong competition in its business. LXL will compete against many companies to attract and engage users, including, (i) broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial radio providers such as Clear Channel and CBS and satellite radio providers such as Sirius XM, (ii) interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, such as Apple\u2019s iTunes Music Store and Apple Music, RDIO, Rhapsody, Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Amazon that allow listeners to stream music or select the audio content that they stream or purchase and (iii) other forms of entertainment, including Facebook (including Instagram), Google, Twitter (including Periscope), Yahoo, and Meerkat which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. To the extent users choose to watch satellite or cable television, stream video from on-demand services such as Hulu, VEVO or YouTube or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than use the LXL service, these content services pose a competitive threat. We believe that LXL\u2019s ability to compete effectively for users depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 the timing and market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u00b7 the adoption of our products and services domestically and internationally;\n\u00b7 our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services;\n\u00b7 the frequency and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain relationships with platform partners that integrate with our platform;\n\u00b7 changes mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\n\u00b7 our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees, particularly engineers, designers and product managers;\n\u00b7 acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and\n\u00b7 our reputation and the brand strength relative to our competitors.\nLXL also will face significant competition for advertiser spend. We expect the substantial majority of LXL\u2019s advertising revenue will be generated through festival sponsorships and ads on the LXL mobile app and website, and LXL competes against online and mobile businesses, including those referenced above, and traditional media outlets, such as television, radio and print, for advertising budgets. LXL also will compete with advertising networks, exchanges, demand side platforms and other platforms, such as Google AdSense, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, Yahoo Ad Exchange, AOL\u2019s Ad.com and Microsoft Media Network, for marketing budgets and in the development of the tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. In order to grow LXL\u2019s revenue and improve LXL\u2019s operating results, LXL must increase its share of spending on advertising relative to its competitors, many of which are larger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products. In addition, some of LXL\u2019s larger competitors have substantially broader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain additional share of advertising budgets.\nIf LXL is not able to compete effectively for users and advertisers spend our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nLXL\u2019s products and services may contain undetected software errors, which could harm our business and operating results.\nLXL\u2019s products and services incorporate complex software and we encourage employees to quickly develop and help us launch new and innovative features. Our software, including any open source software that is incorporated into our code, may contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities. Any errors, bugs or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of platform partners, loss of advertisers or advertising revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nLXL\u2019s products and services contain open source software, and LXL licenses some of its software through open source projects, which may pose particular risks to LXL proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative effect on our business.\nLXL uses open source software in its products and services and will use open source software in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which LXL is subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on LXL\u2019s ability to provide or distribute its products or services. Additionally, LXL may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that LXL developed using such software, which could include LXL proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require LXL to make its software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until LXL can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and LXL may not be able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe will require substantial amounts of capital to develop, launch and operate LXL, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nWe will require substantial amounts of capital to develop, launch and operate LXL. Our ability to obtain financing, if and when required, will depend on investor and lender demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets and other factors, and we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur revenue depends in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns, and there can be no assurance that such advertising, promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits.\nSuch marketing activities include, among others, promotion of events and ticket sales, premium seat sales, hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related merchandise and apparel. There can be no assurance that these marketing or advertising efforts will be successful or will generate revenue or profits.\nWe are vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth.\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we expect to achieve organically and through acquisitions and the demands and additional responsibilities that our growth will place on our management.\nThe following factors could present us with difficulties in managing our growth:\n\u00b7 a lack of sufficient executive-level personnel;\n\u00b7 the inability to successfully develop, expand and monetize our digital music, video and other content offerings;\n\u00b7 an increased administrative burden on our employees;\n\u00b7 the inability to attract, train, manage and retain the qualified personnel necessary to manage and operate a greater number of venues, events and other business activities; and\n\u00b7 the inability to integrate acquired businesses.\nIf we fail to address these and other challenges associated with our anticipated growth, our growth itself may fail to materialize, we may grow without achieving profitability, we may have difficulty with our internal controls and procedures and the quality of our events and other offerings may decline, among other things. Any of these could harm our business and financial results.\nOCL and/or LXL may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks.\nThe occurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, intentional or unintentional mass-casualty incidents, natural disasters or similar events, may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events, which may decrease OCL\u2019s and/or LXL\u2019s revenue or expose them to substantial liability. The terrorism and security incidents in the past, military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities.\nFollowing past terrorism actions, some artists refused to travel or book tours, which adversely affected our business. The occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, military actions by the United States or others, contagious disease outbreaks, natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the United States, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries where we may do business in the future.\nTo service OCL\u2019s lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions and capital expenditures, OCL will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOCL\u2019s ability to service its lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control. This is, to an extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that OCL\u2019s business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to OCL in an amount sufficient to enable OCL to pay its lease obligations or to fund its other liquidity needs. If OCL\u2019s future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay its obligations as they occur or to fund its liquidity needs, it may be forced to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets or obtain additional equity capital.\nThese measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting OCL to meet scheduled lease obligations. It may be unable to restructure or refinance its obligations and obtain debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all. Capital markets have been volatile in the recent past; a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise. As a result, the inability to meet OCL\u2019s lease obligations could cause it to default on those obligations. Any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to the seasonality of our business and other factors related to our business;\n\u00b7 our loss of or inability to obtain significant popular artists;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u00b7 the publication by securities analysts of financial estimates or reports about our business;\n\u00b7 changes by securities analysts of earnings estimates or reports, or our inability to meet those estimates or achieve any goals described in those reports;\n\u00b7 the disclosure of facts about our business that may differ from those assumed by securities analysts in preparing their estimates or reports about us;\n\u00b7 media reports, whether accurate or inaccurate;\n\u00b7 receptivity of the capital markets to our efforts to expand into the live music festival streaming business;\n\u00b7 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u00b7 overall market fluctuations; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nIn particular, the realization of any of the risks described in these Risk Factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them. If a suit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, which could affect its market price.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth, development and expansion of our business and/or to repay existing indebtedness. Accordingly, we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The declaration, payment and amount of future dividends, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow from operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of Nevada law.\nAccordingly, holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected.\nFuture sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.\nWe have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. As of June 26, 2015, there were approximately 45.0 million shares of Company common stock outstanding (including 1.41 million shares of unvested restricted stock awards), and warrants to purchase 1.475 million shares of common stock.\nWe continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy. These acquisitions may involve the payment of cash, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities. Any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time. In addition, future financing transactions through the sale of additional shares of our common stock at or below market prices may adversely affect our stock prices. The price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock.\nOur directors and officers do not hold the majority of voting rights to control or to submit to stockholders for approval matters related to the operations of OCHL, OCL or KOKO.\nPursuant to the OCHL Shareholder Agreement and the Variation Agreement, the Company is restricted from taking actions on behalf of OCHL without the written consent of Mr. Bengough, and Mr. Bengough\u2019s consent is required for most material actions to be taken by OCHL and OCL, so long as the OCHL Shareholder\u2019s Agreement and the Variation Agreement remain in effect. This severely limits the power of the shareholders of the Company to vote to take actions with respect to KOKO\u2019s business. Therefore, the management of the Company needs to make decisions relating to the operations of KOKO in consultation with Mr. Bengough and subject to the terms of the OCHL Shareholders Agreement and the Variation Agreement.", "PERMNO": 17323, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LIVX"}
