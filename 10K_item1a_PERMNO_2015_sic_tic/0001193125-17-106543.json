{"cik": "315545", "company": "PROVECTUS BIOPHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business and its future performance may be affected by various factors, the most significant of which are discussed below.\nWe are a development stage company, have no prescription drug products approved for commercial sale, have incurred substantial losses, and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a development stage company that has no prescription drug products approved for commercial sale. We have never generated any substantial revenues and may never achieve substantial revenues or profitability. As of December 31, 2016, we have incurred net losses of $205 million in the aggregate since inception in January 2002. We expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability, even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our prescription drug candidates, OTC products, or non-core technologies. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating expenditures and anticipate that our operating and capital expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop and seek regulatory approval for our prescription drug candidates PV-10 and PH-10;\n\u2022\nseek licensure of PV-10, PH-10, our OTC products, and our other non-core technologies;\n\u2022\nfurther develop our non-core technologies;\n\u2022\nimplement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nhire additional personnel.\nWe also expect to experience negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and any future capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock.\nAll of our existing prescription drug candidates are in early to intermediate stages of development. It may be several years, if ever, until we have a prescription drug product available for commercial resale. If we do not successfully develop and license or commercialize our prescription drug candidates, or sell or license our OTC products or non-core technologies, we will not achieve revenues or profitability in the foreseeable future, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenues or achieve profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe need additional capital to conduct our operations and commercialize and/or further develop our prescription drug candidates in 2017 and beyond, and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain.\nWe need additional capital in 2017 and beyond as we continue to develop and seek commercialization of our prescription drug candidates. We intend to proceed as rapidly as possible with licensure of PH-10 on the basis of our expanding phase 2 atopic dermatitis and psoriasis results, which continue to be developed. We potentially may license PV-10 depending on the timing for the optimal deal structure for our stockholders. We are also focusing on PV-10 geographic licensing and partnering opportunities in such countries as China and India. We are also focusing on potential co-development partnering opportunities with combination of PV-10\nand immune checkpoint blockade or systemic immunotherapy agents. We intend to also proceed as rapidly as possible with the sale or licensure of our OTC products and other non-core technologies. Although we believe that there is a reasonable basis for our expectation that we will become profitable due to both the licensure of PH-10 and PV-10, and the sale or licensure of our OTC products and non-core technologies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve, or maintain, a level of profitability sufficient to meet our operating expenses.\nWe have based our estimate of capital needs on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we cannot assure you that estimates and assumptions will remain unchanged. For example, we are currently assuming that we will continue to operate without any significant staff or other resources expansion. On March 19, 2017, we entered into an exclusive Definitive Financing Commitment Term Sheet with a group of our stockholders, which was amended and restated effective as of March 19, 2017 (the \u201cTerm Sheet\u201d), which sets forth the terms on which such investors will use their best efforts to provide financing to the Company in the minimum amount of $10 million up to $20 million (the \u201c2017 Financing\u201d). In connection with our entry into the Term Sheet, on March 20, 2017, we announced the termination of our offering of subscription rights to our existing common stockholders and holders of our class of warrants with an exercise price of $0.85 expiring June 19, 2020 (the \u201cListed Warrants\u201d) to purchase units (\u201cUnits\u201d) consisting of shares of common stock and Series C Preferred Stock (the \u201cRights Offering\u201d), without accepting any funds from investors. We intend to acquire additional funding through the financing contemplated by the Term Sheet, and we may also seek capital from public or private equity or debt financings or other financing sources that may be available. Such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. As discussed in more detail below, additional equity financing could result in significant dilution to stockholders. Further, in the event that additional funds are obtained through licensing or other arrangements, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our products, product candidates, and technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves. If sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and may impair the value of our patents and other intangible assets.\nThere is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $1,165,738 at December 31, 2016, compared with $14,178,902 at December 31, 2015. We continue to incur significant operating losses, and management expects that significant on-going operating expenditures will be necessary to successfully implement our business plan and develop and market our products. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued. Implementation of our plans and our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon our ability to develop PV-10 and raise additional capital.\nManagement believes that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings (including the 2017 Equity Offering), exchange offers, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means. In addition, we continue to explore opportunities to strategically monetize our lead drug candidate, PV-10, through potential licensing transactions, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful with such plans. We have historically been able to raise capital through equity offerings, although no assurance can be provided that we will continue to be successful in the future. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital through the 2017 Equity Offering or otherwise, we will not be able to pay our obligations as they become due.\nOur prescription drug candidates are at an intermediary stage of development and may never obtain U.S. or international regulatory approvals required for us to commercialize our prescription drug candidates.\nWe will need approval of the FDA to commercialize our prescription drug candidates in the U.S. and approvals from the FDA equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our prescription drug candidates in those jurisdictions.\nWe are continuing to pursue clinical development of our most advanced prescription drug candidates, PV-10 and PH-10, for use as treatments for specific conditions. The continued and further development of these prescription drug candidates will require significant additional research, formulation and manufacture development, and pre-clinical and extensive clinical testing prior to their regulatory approval and commercialization. Pre-clinical and clinical studies of our prescription drug candidates may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after experiencing promising results in earlier trials. Pharmaceutical drug and medical device products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market or be marketed successfully for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\na product may be found to be ineffective or have harmful side effects during subsequent pre-clinical testing or clinical trials,\n\u2022\na product may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearance,\n\u2022\na product may be too difficult to manufacture on a large scale,\n\u2022\na product may be too expensive to manufacture or market,\n\u2022\na product may not achieve broad market acceptance,\n\u2022\nothers may hold proprietary rights that will prevent a product from being marketed, and\n\u2022\nothers may market equivalent or superior products.\nSatisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional nonclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\ndelay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpose costly procedures on us; and\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nWe do not expect any prescription drug and other product candidates that we are developing to be commercially available without a partner. Our research and product development efforts may not be successfully completed and may not result in any successfully commercialized products. Further, after commercial introduction of a new product, discovery of problems through adverse event reporting could result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal from the market and, in certain cases, civil or criminal penalties.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, we cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for any of our prescription drug or other product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by reducing our number of salable products and, therefore, corresponding product revenues.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our drugs. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above.\nOur former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, as well as our former Interim Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, received travel expense advancements, which may be deemed a violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and/or other federal securities laws.\nOur internal control testing for the year ended December 31, 2015 identified inadequate supporting documentation and lack of adequate review for the travel advances and expense reimbursements to H. Craig Dees, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nIn February 2016, the Audit Committee initiated a review of Company procedures, policies and practices, including travel expense advancements and reimbursements to Dr. Dees. The Audit Committee retained independent counsel and an advisory firm with forensic accounting expertise to assist the Audit Committee in conducting the investigation. As part of the investigation, the Committee reviewed the Company\u2019s financial policies and procedures, including management expenses. The Audit Committee concluded that Dr. Dees did not produce receipts for most of the travel expense advances he received from 2013 to 2015, and that some receipts produced by Dr. Dees during this period appear to have been altered.\nA subsequent investigation conducted by a special committee of the Board of Directors regarding travel expenses of Peter R. Culpepper, our former Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, concluded that Mr. Culpepper did not produce receipts and/or proof of travel for certain travel expense advances he received.\nSection 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits personal loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. If the SEC were to institute proceedings to enforce a violation of this statute or other federal securities laws as a result of the travel advances to Dr. Dees or Mr. Culpepper, we may become a party to litigation or proceedings over these matters, and the outcome of such litigation or proceedings (including criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or penalties by the SEC), alone or in addition to the costs of litigation, may materially and adversely affect our business. The Company is unable to predict the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to the advances to Dr. Dees and Mr. Culpepper.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. We cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies do not exist or that they will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on the results of management\u2019s assessment and evaluation of our internal controls, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weakness described below.\nThe Company has identified the following material weakness related to its travel expense advancement and reimbursement policies and procedures to Dr. Dees and Mr. Culpepper: (1) the documentation provided for an expenditure was not sufficient to support the authorization of such expenditure, (2) only the check register and not the supporting documentation was obtained by an executive officer approving the expenses incurred by another executive officer, and (3) there was not adequate reconciliation of travel advances to actual expenses. As a result, our management also has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective such that the information relating to our Company required to be disclosed in the reports we file with the SEC (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe continue to aggressively remediate the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. To do so, we have put in place more clearly defined, tighter controls, including a clear process for limiting, approving and documenting travel advances and expenses and appropriately managing them. Specifically, we have:\n\u2022\nAdopted a control enhancement to require the provision of all invoice copies along with the check register for appropriate approval, including all travel reimbursements separately approved;\n\u2022\nEstablished a policy so travel advances are no longer permitted; and\n\u2022\nImplemented a more formal and detailed travel and expense reimbursement policy.\nIn addition, we have replaced the independent consulting group previously utilized by management to aid in our documentation and testing of internal controls over financial reporting and appointed John Glass as our Interim Chief Financial Officer to assist in the organization and strategic operation of the Company as to its procedures and daily operations of the Company. We are also in the process of implementing many of the other recommendations made by counsel to the Audit Committee to remediate these issues, including the identification and recruitment of a permanent Chief Executive Officer and any other positions necessary. We believe the foregoing actions will continue to improve our internal control over financial reporting as well as our disclosure controls and procedures. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the area affected by the material weakness discussed above, and will perform any additional procedures, as well as implement any new resources and policies, deemed necessary by our management to remediate the material weakness.\nIf we do not successfully remediate the material weakness described above, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies arise in the future, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis or prevent fraud, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and require restatement which could result in the loss of investor confidence, delisting or cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical trials for our product candidates, including PV-10. The positive clinical results obtained for our product candidates in prior clinical studies may not be repeated in future clinical studies.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, including PV-10, we must conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Competition in clinical development has made it difficult to enroll patients at an acceptable rate in our clinical trials. Advances in medical technology could make our product candidates obsolete prior to completion of clinical testing. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nIn October 2012, we presented final top-line data from the phase 2 trial of PV-10 for metastatic melanoma, and in March 2014, applied for BTD with the FDA, which was subsequently denied pending new clinical evidence that supports BTD. We (i) are conducting an expanded phase 1 trial of PV-10 for metastatic liver cancer; (ii) are conducting an exploratory phase 1 trial of PV-10 for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) metastatic to the liver; (iii) have completed a phase 1 clinical study of PV-10 for recurrent breast cancer; (iv) have completed a phase 1 trial of PV-10 in an investigator initiated study to ascertain the feasibility of detecting immune cell infiltrates in injected melanoma tumors which led to publication of data in 2016; (v) are conducting advanced immunologic profiling of clinical samples obtained in a phase 2 clinical trial for mechanism of action of PH-10 for psoriasis; (vi) have completed multiple phase 2 clinical trials of PH-10 for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis; (vii) have commenced a global phase 3 clinical trial to assess response to intralesional PV-10 versus that of investigator\u2019s choice of systemic chemotherapy or intralesional oncolytic viral therapy in patients with melanoma confined to cutaneous and subcutaneous sites; and (viii) have commenced a phase 1b/2 study of PV-10 and Merck\u2019s KEYTRUDA in late stage melanoma. While we have experience with earlier phase clinical development, we have never conducted a phase 3 clinical trial. The positive results we have seen to date in our phase 2 clinical trials of PV-10 for metastatic melanoma do not ensure that later clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy characteristics despite having progressed satisfactorily through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in phase 3 clinical development, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nWe may experience a number of unforeseen events during clinical trials for our product candidates, including PV-10, that could delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of our clinical trials, including the following:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nthe clinical study protocol may require one or more amendments delaying study completion;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of subjects required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, subjects may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate and enrollment in these clinical trials has been significantly slower than we anticipated so we have had to expand our geographic scope of enrollment of patients;\n\u2022\nclinical investigators or study subjects fail to comply with clinical study protocols;\n\u2022\ntrial conduct and data analysis errors may occur, including, but not limited to, data entry and/or labeling errors;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our clinical trial materials or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to suspend or terminate the trials.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we expand our phase 3 clinical trial of PV-10 to achieve patient accrual needs with respect to PV-10 as planned, and undertake additional clinical trials of our other product candidates. Because successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds required to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development; however, if the full $20 million of the 2017 Equity Offering is raised, we believe the proceeds from the 2017 Equity Offering will be sufficient to fund the expansion of the geographical scope necessary to complete patient accrual in our ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of PV-10 and continue our current development activities with respect to PV-10.\nNegative or inconclusive results of our future clinical trials of PV-10, or any other clinical trial we conduct, could cause the FDA to require that we repeat or conduct additional clinical studies. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for PV-10, we do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates, including PV-10. If later stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, including PV-10, may be adversely impacted.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. We may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Events which may result in delays or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials, including our future clinical trials for PV-10, include the following:\n\u2022\ninability to raise funding, if necessary, to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement with the FDA on final trial design;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board (IRB) approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by clinical sites dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new clinical sites or to obtain regulatory approval and open sites in geographic regions beyond the sites initially planned; and\n\u2022\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials for our product candidates, including PV-10, are delayed for any of the above reasons, our development costs may increase, the approval process could be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates may be reduced and our competitors may bring products to market before us. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that current or future clinical trials of our prescription drug candidates will take additional years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ndetermination of dosing issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our submissions or the conduct of these trials.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our claims concerning our prescription drug candidates.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our claims concerning our prescription drug candidates. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans or effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, we anticipate that our clinical trials will involve only a small patient population. Accordingly, the results of such trials may not be indicative of future results over a larger patient population.\nPhysicians and patients may not accept and use our prescription drug candidates.\nEven if the FDA approves our prescription drug candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of our prescription drug products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our prescription drug products;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness of our prescription drug products relative to competing products;\n\u2022\navailability of reimbursement for our prescription drug products from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nBecause we expect sales or licensure of our prescription drug candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nWe have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities for our prescription drug candidates or our OTC products and non-core technologies.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our prescription drug candidates or our OTC products and non-core technologies. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain such collaborative relationships, the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to proceed as rapidly as possible with licensure of PH-10 on the basis of our Phase 2 atopic dermatitis and psoriasis results, which are in process of being further developed. We have determined that the most efficient use of our capital in further developing our OTC products is to license the products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our product in the United States or overseas.\nWe cannot be sure that our OTC products or non-core technologies will be licensed or sold in the marketplace.\nIn order for our OTC products to become commercially successful and our non-core technologies to be further developed, we must license or sell those products and technologies. We have been discussing this strategy with interested groups, though we cannot be sure that we will be successful in licensing or selling such products or technologies.\nCompetition in the prescription pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense, and we may be unable to succeed if our competitors have more funding or better marketing.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in research efforts related to treatment of dermatological conditions or cancers of the skin, liver and breast, which may compete with our clinical trials for patients and investigator resources and have caused lesser enrollment than anticipated, and could lead to the development of products or therapies that could compete directly with the prescription drug and other product candidates, and OTC products that we are seeking to develop and market.\nMany companies are also developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and dermatological conditions and, in this regard, are our competitors. Many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in:\n\u2022\nresearch and development;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing;\n\u2022\npreclinical and clinical testing;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nmarketing.\nSmaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies that may compete with our efforts to establish similar collaborative arrangements. Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development, and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs.\nIn addition to the above factors, we expect to face competition in the following areas:\n\u2022\nproduct efficacy and safety;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory consents;\n\u2022\navailability of resources;\n\u2022\nreimbursement coverage;\n\u2022\nprice; and\n\u2022\npatent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.\nSince our prescription candidates PV-10 and PH-10 have not yet been approved by the FDA or introduced to the marketplace, we cannot estimate what competition these products might face when they are finally introduced, if at all. We cannot assure you that these products will not face significant competition for other prescription drugs and generic equivalents.\nIf we are unable to secure or enforce patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for our products and technologies we develop or license. In addition, our competitors may develop products similar to ours using methods and technologies that are beyond the scope of our intellectual property protection, which could reduce our anticipated sales. While some of our products have proprietary patent protection, a challenge to these patents can subject us to expensive litigation. Litigation concerning patents, other forms of intellectual property, and proprietary technology is becoming more widespread and can be protracted and expensive and can distract management and other personnel from performing their duties.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop a competitive position. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and technology, or that we can adequately protect our trade secrets and technology.\nIf we are unable to secure or enforce patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. If we infringe on the intellectual property of others, our business could be harmed.\nWe could be sued for infringing patents or other intellectual property that purportedly cover products and/or methods of using such products held by persons other than us. Litigation arising from an alleged infringement could result in removal from the market, or a substantial delay in, or prevention of, the introduction of our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we do not update and enhance our technologies, they will become obsolete.\nThe pharmaceutical market is characterized by rapid technological change, and our future success will depend on our ability to conduct successful research in our fields of expertise, to discover new technologies as a result of that research, to develop products based on our technologies, and to commercialize those products. While we believe that our current technology is adequate for our present needs, if we fail to stay at the forefront of technological development, we will be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors are using substantial resources to develop new pharmaceutical technologies and to commercialize products based on those technologies. Accordingly, our technologies may be rendered obsolete by advances in existing technologies or the development of different technologies by one or more of our current or future competitors.\nThe resignation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, the termination of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and former Chief Financial Officer and our searches for, and appointments of, a long-term Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Financial Officer creates uncertainties and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEffective February 27, 2016, Dr. Dees resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Culpepper, who was then serving as our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, was appointed to serve as our Interim Chief Executive Officer until our Board of Directors completed its search process for a successor Chief Executive Officer to replace Dr. Dees. On December 27, 2016, the Board of Directors unanimously voted to terminate Mr. Culpepper, effective immediately, from all positions he held with the Company and each of its subsidiaries, including Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, for cause, in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement based on the results of the investigation conducted by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors regarding improper expense advances and reimbursements to Mr. Culpepper.\nWe face significant competition for executives with the qualifications and experience we are seeking. There can be no assurances concerning the timing or outcome of the Company\u2019s search for a new permanent Chief Executive Officer. The Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategies may be adversely affected by the uncertainty associated with this transition.\nExecutive leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business. As a result of the recent changes in our management team, our existing management team has taken on substantially more responsibility, which has resulted in greater workload demands and could divert their attention away from certain key areas of our business. In addition, management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result. The loss of services of one or more other members of senior management, or the inability to attract a qualified permanent Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we lose any of our key personnel, we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan.\nOur business is presently managed by two key employees and an independent contractor:\n\u2022\nTimothy C. Scott, Ph.D., our President;\n\u2022\nEric A. Wachter, Ph.D. our Chief Technology Officer; and\n\u2022\nJohn R. Glass, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, who is an independent contractor.\nIn addition to their responsibilities for management of our overall business strategy, Drs. Scott and Wachter are our chief researchers in the fields in which we are developing and planning to develop our prescription drug and other product candidates, and our OTC products. The loss of any of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and our ability to execute our business plan might be negatively impacted. Any of these key employees or Mr. Glass may leave their employment or consulting arrangement with us if they choose to do so, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to hire similarly qualified employees if any of our key employees or Mr. Glass should choose to leave.\nBecause we have only two employees and an independent contractor in total, our management may be unable to successfully manage our business.\nIn order to successfully execute our business plan, our management must succeed in all of the following critical areas:\n\u2022\nResearching diseases and possible therapies in the areas of oncology, dermatology and skin care, and biotechnology;\n\u2022\nDeveloping our prescription drug and other product candidates, and OTC products based on our research;\n\u2022\nMarketing and selling developed products;\n\u2022\nObtaining additional capital to finance research, development, production, and marketing of our products; and\n\u2022\nManaging our business as it grows.\nAs discussed above, we currently have only two employees, both of whom are full-time employees and an independent contractor, John R. Glass, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, managing our business. The greatest burden of succeeding in the above areas, therefore, falls on Drs. Scott and Wachter and Mr. Glass. Focusing on any one of these areas may divert their attention from our other areas of concern and could affect our ability to manage other aspects of our business. We cannot assure you that our management will be able to succeed in all of these areas or, even if we do so succeed, that our business will be successful as a result. While we have not historically had difficulty in attracting employees, our small size and limited operating history may make it difficult for us to attract and retain employees in the future, which could further divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Among other things, these provisions will:\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022\nnot provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election; and\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors or by such person or persons requested by a majority of the board of directors to call such meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nNYSE MKT has taken actions toward delisting our common stock, including suspending trading in our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide, on October 13, 2016, the NYSE MKT immediately suspended trading in shares of our common stock and Listed Warrants and commenced delisting procedures as a result of the abnormally low trading price of our common stock. We are appealing the NYSE MKT decision to commence delisting procedures. On October 20, 2016, we submitted a request for a review of such delisting determination, and on November 10, 2016, we submitted to the Listing Qualifications Panel our written submission in connection with our appeal. The hearing before the Listing Qualifications Panel occurred on January 25, 2017. On January 31, 2017, we received notice from NYSE MKT that the Listing Qualifications Panel concurred with NYSE Regulation\u2019s determination to delist the Company\u2019s common stock and class of listed warrants. On February 14, 2017, we submitted a request for a review by the full Committee for Review to reconsider the decision of the Listing Qualifications Panel. The Committee for Review will consider the Company\u2019s request for review on March 30, 2017. In the event our appeal is unsuccessful, our common stock will be delisted from the NYSE MKT.\nIn addition, on November 23, 2016, we received notice from NYSE MKT indicating that we are not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more if the Company has reported\nlosses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years). As of December 31, 2016, we had stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $3,500,000. On December 22, 2016, we submitted a plan addressing how we intend to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) by May 23, 2018. If the plan is not accepted, NYSE Regulation will take action to cite our noncompliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide as an additional basis for delisting. If the plan is accepted, we will be subject to periodic reviews and continued compliance with the plan. If we are not in compliance with the continued listing standards as of May 23, 2018, or do not make progress consistent with the plan, NYSE MKT will initiate delisting proceedings.\nOur stock price is below $5.00 per share and is treated as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which places restrictions on broker-dealers recommending the stock for purchase.\nOur common stock is defined as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act and its rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to include common stock that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules include the following requirements:\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers must deliver, prior to the transaction, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market;\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer and its registered representative;\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers must disclose current quotations for the securities; and\n\u2022\na broker-dealer must furnish its customers with monthly statements disclosing recent price information for all penny stocks held in the customer\u2019s account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nAdditional sales practice requirements are imposed on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. If our common stock remains subject to these penny stock rules these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our stock, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell their shares.\nFuture sales by our stockholders may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nSales of our common stock in the public market following any prospective offering could lower the market price of our common stock. Sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable.\nIt is our general policy to retain any earnings for use in our operation.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in our business and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, although we intend to issue shares of common stock in satisfaction of the dividend payments due on our Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock.", "PERMNO": 68276, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PVCT"}
