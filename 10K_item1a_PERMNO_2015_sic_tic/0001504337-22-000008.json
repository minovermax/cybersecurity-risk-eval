Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and another pandemic in the future could have, repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets.\nIn the domestic paperboard and tissue markets in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant variability. Following the significant increase in demand for tissue products due to at-home consumer purchasing behavior during 2020, we experienced a significant decrease in demand early in 2021 followed by upticks in demand in the second half of the year. Demand for paperboard products has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with increases in some end-market segments like food and healthcare packaging and decreases in food service and commercial print.\nOur business, the businesses of our customers and the businesses of our suppliers could be materially and adversely affected by the impact and risks of the pandemic. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the interruption of our distribution system or delays in the delivery of our products;\n\u2022temporary or long-term disruption in our supply chains;\n\u2022the complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022the loss of our management team and employee base that possess unique technical skills for the execution of our business plan;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to operate our business as a result of any federal, state or local regulations;\n\u2022disruptions to international trade, or further restrictions or prohibitions on international travel, on which we rely to make our products (for example, an interruption in eucalyptus pulp from Brazil or lack of availability for spare parts or technical support from European suppliers of our production and converting equipment);\n\u2022variability in demand for our products, including inability to meet a sharp increase in demand, a decrease in demand for our products as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or global recession (for example, during previous, extreme recessionary periods in the U.S., we experienced significant declines in demand for our paperboard used in folding carton, cup and liquid packaging applications);\n\u2022volatility related to pension plan assets (for example, we may need to make additional contributions to address an increase in obligations and/or a loss in plan assets as a result of the combination of declining market interest rates and/or past or future plan asset investment losses);\n\u2022significant disruption of global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future;\n\u2022a decline in our ability to collect on accounts receivable, which could materially affect our liquidity;\n\u2022bankruptcy of customers that leads to a decrease in demand for our products;\n\u2022and an interruption in processing or an inability to process accounts payable by our third-party processor, which could result in our suppliers and vendors withholding supplies or services.\nIncreases in tissue supply, particularly in the premium and ultra categories, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOver the past few years, several new or refurbished premium and ultra-quality tissue paper machines and converting assets have been completed or announced by us and by our competitors, including private label competitors, which has resulted and will continue to result in a substantial increase in the supply of premium and ultra-quality tissue in the North American market. Additionally, several new or refurbished conventional tissue machines have been installed or announced, including as a result of foreign competitors increasing their presence and operations in North America. As a result of increased tissue demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, foreign tissue manufacturers increased exports into the U.S. market, regional tissue manufacturers increased their production, and some away-from-home tissue\nmanufacturers re-purposed their products to the at-home market, all of which increased tissue supply. We believe that increasing tissue capacity, together with intensifying competition experienced by our retail customers, has made it difficult for us to pass through to our customers the significant increases in input costs we have experienced in the last several years. If demand for tissue products in the North American market does not increase or consumer purchasing of premium and ultra-quality tissue do not increase commensurate with the increased capacity, the increase in supply of ultra-quality tissue products could have a material adverse effect on the price of premium and ultra-quality tissue products. In addition, increased supply of premium and ultra-quality tissue may adversely affect the market prices and margins for such tissue and result in the displacement of demand for conventional tissue, which could adversely affect the market price for conventional tissue products, which will continue to represent a significant portion of our total production for the foreseeable future.\nThe loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from, or changes in prices in regard to, any of our large customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a substantial amount of revenues from a concentrated group of customers. Our top 10 customers accounted for 46% of sales in 2021. If we lose any of these customers or a substantial portion of their business or if the terms of our relationship with any of them becomes less favorable to us, our net sales would decline, which would harm our results of operations and financial condition. In 2022, we have some large tissue agreements up for renewal. We have experienced increased price and promotion competition in our consumer products business, and this competition has decreased our gross margins and adversely affected our financial condition.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers that ensure a continuing level of business from them. In addition, our agreements with our customers, including our largest customers, are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments. Our relationship with our largest and most important customers will depend on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products and services at competitive prices. Some of our customers have the capability to produce the parent rolls or products that they purchase from us. If we lose one or more of our large customers or if we experience a significant decline in the level of purchases by any of them, we may not be able to quickly replace the lost business volume and our operating results and business could be harmed.\nThe expansion of our tissue business through the integration of our facilities and production capacity may not proceed as anticipated.\nWe continue to integrate the newest paper machine and converting facilities at our Shelby, North Carolina site within our national tissue network, including the development and production of premium and ultra-quality tissue products. The ongoing integration entails numerous risks, including diverting management's attention from other business concerns, difficulties in the operations integration and product development, and uncertainties regarding the existence of sufficient customer demand for the tissue produced by our integrated network. Any of these risks if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe depend on external sources of wood pulp and wood fiber for a significant portion of our tissue production, which subjects our business and results of operations to potentially significant fluctuations in the price of market pulp and wood fiber.\nOur Consumer Products segment sources a significant portion of its wood pulp requirements from external suppliers, which exposes us to price fluctuation. For 2021, we sourced 60% of our Consumer Product segment pulp requirements (or 30% overall) of our pulp from external sources. Pulp prices can, and have, changed significantly from one period to the next. The volatility of pulp prices can adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers or if the timing of any price increases for our products significantly trails the increases in pulp prices.\nWood fiber is the principal raw material used to create wood pulp, which in turn is used to manufacture our pulp and paperboard products and consumer products. Wood fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences, and our cost of wood fiber may increase in the areas our pulp and paperboard facilities are located due to market shifts in those regions. For example, much of the wood fiber we use in our pulp manufacturing process in Lewiston, Idaho, is the by-product of sawmill operations. As a result, the price of these residual wood fibers is affected by operating levels in both the pulp and paper and lumber industries. During the past decade in the western U.S. many sawmills have closed or curtailed operations or their operations have been consolidated. Further, the expansion of operations and production of other paper mills and wood pellet manufacturers in the Inland Northwest region of the United States has increased the demand and price for wood fiber. Additionally, the ability of paper and wood pellet mills in British Columbia to acquire wood fiber from the U.S. Inland Northwest region with limited to no reciprocal ability by U.S. mills to acquire wood fiber from\nBritish Columbia, reduces the supply of, and increases the costs, for wood fiber. The price of wood fiber in the Pacific Northwest is expected to remain volatile.\nThe primary source for wood fiber is timber, the availability of which may be limited by adverse weather, fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, windstorms, flooding and other natural and man-made causes, thereby reducing supply and increasing prices. Our Arkansas pulp and paperboard facility relies on whole log chips for a significant portion of its wood fiber.\nThe effects on market prices for wood fiber resulting from various governmental programs involving tax credits or payments related to biomass and other renewable energy projects or from environmental litigation or regulation are uncertain and could result in a reduction in the supply of wood fiber available for our pulp and paperboard manufacturing operations. Additionally, wood pellet facilities or fluff pulp facilities, can increase demand and prices for wood fiber. If we and our pulp suppliers are unable to obtain wood fiber at favorable prices or at all, our costs will increase and our operations and financial results may be harmed.\nDisruptions in transportation services or increases in our transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent on transportation services to deliver our products to our customers and to deliver raw materials to us as well as for intercompany shipments of parent rolls. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed or disrupted due to weather conditions, labor shortages or strikes, regulatory actions or other events. If our transportation providers are unavailable or fail to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may incur increased costs and we may be unable to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis. In 2021, we experienced both difficulties in procuring sufficient transportation for intercompany and external shipments as well as significant increases in transportation costs due to a number of factors.\nThe costs of these transportation services are also affected by geopolitical, economic and weather-related events. We have not been able in the past, and may not be able in the future, to pass along part or all of any fuel price increases to customers. If we are unable to increase our prices because of increased fuel or transportation costs, our gross margins may be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers and vendors required for the production of our products and our operations.\nOur dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers, and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. Limitations on the availability of, and subsequent increases in, the costs of raw materials, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot be certain that our current suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or will continue to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. Although we believe there are other suppliers of these raw materials, we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe also depend on a limited number of third-party vendors for certain of our operating equipment and spare parts. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers or vendors could interrupt production of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe cost of chemicals and energy needed for our manufacturing processes significantly affects our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing processes, including petroleum-based polyethylene and certain petroleum-based latex chemicals. Prices for these chemicals have been and are expected to remain volatile. In addition, chemical suppliers that use petroleum-based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may, due to supply shortages and cost increases, ration the amount of chemicals available to us, and therefore we may not be able to obtain at favorable prices the chemicals we need to operate our business, if we are able to obtain them at all.\nOur manufacturing operations also utilize large amounts of electricity and natural gas. Energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade, which in turn affects our operational costs. We purchase on the open market a substantial portion of the natural gas necessary to produce our products, and, as a result, the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand, geopolitical events, government regulation, weather, interruptions in pipeline and other delivery systems and natural disasters. Our energy costs in future\nperiods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally, on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage. Any significant energy shortage or significant increase in our energy costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any disruption in the supply of energy could also affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation and our business.\nCompetitors' branded products and private label products could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur tissue products compete with well-known, branded products, as well as other private label products. Our business may be harmed by new product offerings by competitors, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and price competition from companies that may have greater financial resources than we do. If we are unable to offer our existing customers, or new customers, tissue products comparable to branded products or other companies' private label products in terms of quality, customer service and/or price, we may lose business or we may not be able to grow our existing business, and we may be forced to sell lower-margin products, all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLarger competitors have operational and other advantages over our operations.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, and companies that have substantially greater financial resources compete with us in each market. Some of our competitors have advantages over us, including lower raw material and labor costs and better access to the inputs of our products.\nOur Consumer Products business faces competition from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce alternative products that customers may use instead of our products. Our Consumer Products business competes with the branded tissue products producers, such as Procter & Gamble, and branded label producers who manufacture branded and private label products, such as Georgia-Pacific and Kimberly-Clark. These companies are far larger than us, have more sales, marketing and research and development resources than we do, and enjoy significant cost advantages due to economies of scale. In addition, because of their size and resources, these companies may foresee market trends more accurately than we do and develop new technologies that render our products less attractive or obsolete.\nOur ability to successfully compete in the pulp and paperboard industry is influenced by a number of factors, including manufacturing capacity, general economic conditions and the availability and demand for paperboard substitutes. Our Pulp and Paperboard business competes with WestRock, Georgia-Pacific, Graphic Packaging, Pactiv Evergreen and other international producers, most of whom are much larger than us. Any increase in manufacturing capacity by any of these or other producers could result in overcapacity in the pulp and paperboard industry, which could cause downward pressure on pricing. For example, a European company recently announced the acquisition of a U.S. based printing and writing grade company, with the intention to convert two paper machines to produce paperboard for the North American market. Increased production by foreign manufacturers may result in increased competition in the North American paperboard markets from direct sales by foreign competitors into these markets or increased competition in the United States as domestic manufacturers seek increased U.S. sales to offset displaced overseas sales caused by increased sales by foreign suppliers into Asia and European markets. Furthermore, customers could choose to use types of paperboard that we do not produce or could rely on alternative materials, such as plastic, for their products. An increased supply of or demand for any of these products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging retail purchasing patterns have increased the need to increase operating efficiencies and diversify our customer base and sales channels.\nWe have historically sold a majority of our consumer tissue products through retail grocery stores. These and other traditional retail outlets are facing increasingly intense competition from supercenters, club stores, wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores. We also face increasingly intense competition from competitors who have incorporated the internet as a direct-to-consumer channel and internet-only providers that sell tissue and other grocery products. The intense competition faced by our customers has resulted in increased efforts by them to reduce costs from suppliers like us and requires that we become more cost efficient to maintain our market share and profitability. The changing retail landscape also requires that we develop and maintain relationships with a wider variety of retailers and retail channels to succeed in this dynamic environment, which can decrease our supply network efficiency and increase our costs.\nConsolidation in the North American paperboard and converting industry may adversely affect our business.\nThe ongoing consolidation of paperboard and paperboard converting businesses, including through the acquisition and integration of such converting businesses by larger competitors of ours, could result in a loss of customers and sales in our pulp and paperboard business. A loss of paperboard customers or sales as a result of consolidations and integrations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and any interruption in the operations of our facilities may harm our operating performance.\nWe regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and facilities. The machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex, interdependent, have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis. We must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and will have to periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors, pumps, pipes and electrical parts. In addition, our pulp and paperboard facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance. These scheduled shutdowns of facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which they occur and could result in unexpected operational issues in future periods as a result of changes to equipment and operational and mechanical processes made during the shutdown period.\nUnexpected production disruptions could cause us to shut down or curtail operations at any of our facilities. Disruptions could occur due to any number of circumstances, including prolonged power outages, mechanical or process failures, shortages of raw materials, natural catastrophes, disruptions in the availability of transportation, labor disputes,cyber attacks and malware, terrorism, changes in or non-compliance with environmental or safety laws, and the lack of availability of services from any of our facilities' key suppliers. For example, in 2021 we had a fire at our Las Vegas facility, and in both 2020 and 2021 severe weather events resulted in the shutdown or curtailment of operations at our Arkansas mill. Any facility shutdowns may be followed by prolonged startup periods, regardless of the reason for the shutdown. Those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks, depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors. Any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 42% of our full-time employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacement agreements on terms acceptable to us. Any failure to reach an agreement with one of the unions may result in strikes, lockouts, work slowdowns, stoppages or other labor actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nCyclical industry conditions have in the past affected and may continue to adversely affect the operating results and cash flows of our pulp and paperboard business.\nOur Pulp and Paperboard business has historically been affected by cyclical market conditions. We may be unable to sustain pricing in the face of weaker demand, and weaker demand may in turn cause us to take production downtime. In addition to lost revenue from lower shipment volumes, production downtime causes unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels. Our results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected in a period of prolonged and significant market weakness. We are not able to predict market conditions or our ability to sustain pricing and production levels during periods of weak demand.\nWe rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations, and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our financial condition.\nWe use information technology, or IT, systems in various aspects of our operations, including enterprise resource planning, management of inventories, manufacturing, supply chain and customer sales. We have different legacy IT systems that we are continuing to integrate, upgrade and move to the cloud. If one of these systems were to fail or cause operational or reporting interruptions, or if we decide to change these systems or hire outside parties to provide these systems, we may suffer disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing and sales operation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may underestimate the costs, complexity and time required to develop and implement new systems.\nWe face cyber-security risks.\nOur business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation and updating, our information technology systems or plant networks could become subject to cyber-attacks. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation, which could result in lost sales, production\ninterruption, business delays, negative publicity, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as global warming. In particular, greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus and this may lead to changes in legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse emissions.\nIncreased regulatory activity at the state, federal and international level is possible regarding climate change as well as other emerging environmental issues associated with our manufacturing sites, such as water quality standards or dam breaching for purposes of aiding salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest. Such new public policy or compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures on our part or even the curtailment of certain of our manufacturing operations.\nWe are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits. In particular, the pulp and paper industry in the United States is subject to several performance based rules associated with effluent and air emissions as a result of certain of its manufacturing processes. Federal, state and local laws and regulations require us to routinely obtain authorizations from and comply with the evolving standards of the appropriate governmental authorities, which have considerable discretion over the terms of permits. Failure to comply with environmental laws and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures, install pollution control equipment, or take other remedial actions, such as product recalls or labeling changes. We also may be required to make additional expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis. There can be no assurance that future environmental permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew existing permits, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe own properties, conduct or have conducted operations at properties, and have assumed indemnity obligations for properties or operations where hazardous materials have been or were used for many years, including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary. Consequently, we will continue to be subject to risks under environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances and to liability for other potential violations of environmental laws or permits at existing sites or ones for which we have indemnity obligations.\nWe may be subject to operational and financial climate change risks\nExtreme, weather-related events caused by climate change, such as prolonged, extreme high or low temperatures, extreme storms, floods and decreased or curtailed water supplies, could result in physical damage to our facilities and operations. Such events may also result in supply chain disruptions and increased costs. For example, in 2021 extreme weather events resulted in the curtailment of natural gas to, and consequent curtailment of operations at, our Arkansas mill. The ability to harvest the wood fiber used in our manufacturing operations may be limited, and prices could become volatile, because of variations in weather, wildfires, and climate conditions. Damage or disruptions we may incur because of climate-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing and sales operations, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may underestimate the costs, complexity and time required to develop and implement mitigation efforts to address potential climate change impacts.\nOur capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated\nWe regularly make capital expenditures and many of our capital projects are complex, costly, and implemented over an extended period of time. We may experience higher expenditures than anticipated for particular capital projects as well as unanticipated business disruptions, and we may not achieve the desired benefits from a given project, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, disputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing capital projects could lead to time-consuming and costly litigation.\nRISK RELATED TO OUR EMPLOYEE PLANS\nWe may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer pension plans; the plans in which we participate are in \u201ccritical and declining\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d financial status and this subjects us to potential liabilities, particularly if we withdraw from a plan.\nWe contribute to two multiemployer pension plans. The amount of our annual contributions to these plans is negotiated with the union representing our employees covered by the plan. In 2021, we contributed approximately $5.7 million to these plans. If in future years we continue to participate in these plans, we may be required to make increased annual contributions, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs. The decision whether to continue to participate in these multiemployer plans does not rest solely with us; rather, it is negotiated as part of the collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that participate in these plans. There are risks associated with both continuing to participate in multiemployer plans and with withdrawing from multiemployer plans.\nIf we were to withdraw partially or completely from a multiemployer plan that is underfunded, we would be liable for a proportionate share of that plan's unfunded vested benefits as required by law. This is called a withdrawal liability.\nIf we continue to participate in a multiemployer pension plan, the future increases in annual contributions are difficult to predict and largely beyond our control. For example, if any other contributing employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan that is underfunded, and the withdrawing employer cannot satisfy its withdrawal liability, then the proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits that would be allocable to us and to the other remaining contributing employers would increase.\nOne of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute, the IAM National Pension Fund, or IAM NPF, elected to be certified to be in \u201ccritical status\u201d for the plan year beginning January 1, 2019. If we were to withdraw from IAM NPF, either completely or partially, we would incur a statutory withdrawal liability based on our proportionate share of IAM NPF\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on information available to us, as well as information provided by IAM NPF, and reviewed by our actuarial consultant, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2021, the withdrawal liability payment that we would be required to make to IAM NPF were we to completely withdraw in 2021 would be a single payment of approximately $4.2 million on a pretax basis. If we were deemed to be included in a \u201cmass withdrawal\u201d from IAM NPF, this payment could be greater or result in our making annual payments. We currently have no plans to withdraw from IAM NPF and have not recognized any liability associated with a withdrawal from IAM NPF in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe other multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute, the PACE Industry Union-Management Pension Fund, or PIUMPF, was certified to be in \u201ccritical status\u201d for the plan year beginning January 1, 2010 and continued to be in critical status through the plan year beginning January 1, 2014. For the plan years beginning January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2021, PIUMPF was certified to be in \"critical and declining status\" under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014. The number of employers participating in PIUMPF fell from 135 during 2012 to 44 during 2020 and the ratio of inactive participants to active employees participating in PIUMPF has increased from 3.4 inactive participants per each active employee at the end of 2013 to 17.2 inactive participants per each active employee at the end of 2020. We are the largest contributing employer remaining in PIUMPF.\nIf we were to withdraw from PIUMPF, either completely or partially, we would incur a statutory withdrawal liability based on our proportionate share of PIUMPF\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on information available to us, as well as information provided by PIUMPF, and reviewed by our actuarial consultant, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2021, the withdrawal liability payments that we would be required to make to PIUMPF were we to completely withdraw in 2021 would be approximately $5.7 million per year on a pretax basis. These payments would continue for 20 years with an estimated present value in excess of $86 million on a pre-tax basis. If we were deemed to be included in a \u201cmass withdrawal\u201d from PIUMPF, these payments could continue indefinitely.\nThe American Recovery Plan Act, or ARPA, includes provisions to provide financial relief to financially troubled multiemployer pension plans. PIUMPF meets the qualifications under ARPA to be eligible for substantial financial relief in an amount intended to allow it to remain solvent until at least 2051. Under the interim final Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, or PBGC, rules promulgated under ARPA, it does not appear likely that IAM NPF would satisfy the qualifications to be eligible for funding under ARPA. Under the interim PBGC rules, it does not appear likely that the legislation would reduce the amount of the statutory withdrawal liability we would incur if we were to withdraw from PIUMPF. We are continuing to assess the impact of the legislation and are awaiting the final PBGC rules that will finalize guidelines and procedures for pension plans to apply for funding. We expect PIUMPF will be eligible to apply in early 2023, although this timing may change if the PBGC makes changes to the application process.\nWere we voluntarily to withdraw from PIUMPF in 2022 or later, we could be subject to substantial payments in addition\nto the withdrawal liability payments described above. As a plan in critical and declining status, PIUMPF has adopted a rehabilitation plan. That plan purports to require a withdrawing employer to make an additional, lump-sum payment - above and beyond the statutory withdrawal liability - based on PIUMPF\u2019s accumulated funding deficiency, or AFD. We do not believe PIUMPF\u2019s purported imposition of the AFD on withdrawing employers is legally enforceable. However, we are aware that one large employer that withdrew from PIUMPF has recognized a liability for payment of an AFD amount and that other withdrawing employers have paid some amounts in respect to the AFD. There have been lawsuits in federal courts challenging PIUMPF\u2019s AFD. These lawsuits have not resolved the issue.\nIf the AFD were held to be legally enforceable, and if we were to elect to withdraw in some future year, the amount of our AFD liability at the time of our withdrawal would be material and subject to a variety of factors including without limitation the nature and timing of a withdrawal, the solvency or insolvency of PIUMPF at the time of the withdrawal, the level of contributions to the plan made by other contributing employers before our withdrawal, whether any employers that had withdrawn in the intervening years had made AFD payments, and the effect of funding provided under ARPA. We are evaluating how PIUMPF\u2019s AFD may be impacted by its use of ARPA funds, although we expect that all other things being equal, the use of ARPA funds will reduce PIUMPF\u2019s AFD over an extended time-period.\nWe believe that the AFD, if held to be lawful, would be assessed only if an employer voluntarily withdraws from PIUMPF and that plan insolvency or any other circumstance that does not involve a voluntary withdrawal by us would not require us to make a payment in respect of the AFD. Therefore, since we currently have no plans to withdraw from PIUMPF, we have not recognized any liability associated with a withdrawal from PIUMPF in our consolidated financial statements.\nIf we were to decide to withdraw voluntarily from PIUMPF in the future, and if the AFD were held to be enforceable against us, the resulting liabilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows. Similarly, if, in the absence of a voluntary withdrawal by us, our understandings as stated above are incorrect regarding the unenforceability of the AFD or the inapplicability of the AFD to us in the event of plan insolvency or other circumstances not involving a voluntary withdrawal by us, the resulting liabilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\nAdverse changes to, or requirements under, pension laws and regulations or adverse changes, requirements or claims pursuant to PIUMPF\u2019s rehabilitation plan, such as the AFD, could increase the likelihood and amount of our liabilities. Were we to withdraw from PIUMPF, these liabilities would be in addition to the pension contributions we would have to make to any new pension plan adopted or contributed to by us to replace PIUMPF. All of this could materially reduce the cash we would have available for business and other needs.\nOur company-sponsored salary pension plan is currently underfunded, and we may be required to make cash payments to the plan, reducing cash available for our business.\nWe have a company-sponsored pension plan covering a portion of our salaried and hourly employees. The volatility in the value of equity and fixed income investments held by this plan, coupled with a low interest rate environment resulting in higher liability valuations, has caused the company-sponsored salary plan to be underfunded as the projected benefit obligation has exceeded the aggregate fair value of plan assets by varying year-end amounts since 2008. At December 31, 2021, our company-sponsored salary pension plan was underfunded in the aggregate by $7.4 million. As a result of underfunding, we may be required to make contributions to our company-sponsored salary plan in future years, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs. In 2021, we made no contributions to the company-sponsored pension plan, and we are not required to make contributions in 2022.\nOur pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors that could cause these costs to change.\nIn addition to our pension plans, we provide health care benefits to certain of our current and former salaried and hourly employees. Our health care costs vary with changes in health care costs generally, which have significantly exceeded general economic inflation rates for many years. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future investment returns. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and mortality rates could also increase pension costs. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $644 million face value of debt outstanding, collectively which is related to our Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below), $300 million 2014 Notes, $275 million 2020 Notes, ABL Credit Agreement (as defined below) and finance leases. After giving effect to borrowing base limitations and issuance of letters of credit, we had availability of approximately $244 million under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.\nOur significant amount of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our notes and Credit Agreements (as defined below);\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings, including those under the Credit Agreements, are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we may still incur significant additional indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the Credit Agreements restrict but do not prohibit us from doing so. After giving effect to borrowing base limitations and issuance of letters of credit, we had availability of approximately $244 million under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the Term Loan Credit Agreement allows us to issue additional secured term loans and/or notes under certain circumstances, which would be guaranteed by our subsidiary guarantors. In addition, the indentures governing our notes do not prevent us from incurring certain other liabilities that do not constitute secured indebtedness. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nWe are exposed to risks related to our arrangements with respect to supply chain financing and banking arrangements.\nWe enter into supply chain financing arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables without recourse. In addition, we maintain bank accounts with several domestic financial institutions, any of which may prove not to be financially viable. If we were to stop entering into these supply chain financing arrangements, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables. However, by entering into these arrangements, and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services, we are exposed to additional risks. If any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our supply chain financing arrangements, we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds, any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we default under the Credit Agreements, or other indebtedness, we may not be able to service our debt obligations.\nIn the event of a default under the Credit Agreements or other indebtedness, lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. If such acceleration occurs, thereby permitting an acceleration of amounts outstanding under our debt obligations, we may not be able to repay the amounts due. Events of default are separately defined in each credit agreement or indenture, but include events such as failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants, default under certain other indebtedness, failure to satisfy judgments in excess of a threshold amount, certain insolvency events and the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Credit Agreements). The occurrence of an event of default could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations, and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nTo service our substantial indebtedness, we must generate significant cash flows. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $644 million of outstanding indebtedness, and we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit agreements in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our Credit Agreements and our outstanding notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Additionally, our debt agreements limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations.\nOur Credit Agreements, contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nOur Credit Agreements, contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to:\n\u2022undergo a change in control;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022make investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022incur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u2022guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022engage in new lines of business; and\n\u2022enter into sale and lease-back transactions.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our discretion could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities, or to borrow in order to fund further capital expenditures.\nWhen (and for as long as) availability, as calculated, under the ABL Credit Agreement is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time, funds deposited into deposit accounts used for collections will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the ABL Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nThere are various limitations on our ability to incur the full $250 million of commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement and borrowings under our ABL Credit Agreement are limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less customary reserves. In addition, under the ABL Credit Agreement, a monthly fixed charge maintenance covenant would become applicable during an event of default or if\navailability, as calculated under the ABL Credit Agreement, is at any time less than 10.0% of the total $250 million of current revolving loan commitments, or $25 million currently. As of December 31, 2021, availability under the ABL Credit Agreement was approximately $244 million. However, it is possible that availability, as calculated under the ABL Credit Agreement, could fall below the 10% threshold in a future period. If the covenant trigger were to occur, we would be required to satisfy and maintain on the last day of each quarter a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1x for the preceding four quarter period for which financial statements had been delivered. As of December 31, 2021, our fixed charge coverage ratio was approximately 3.56x. If and when the fixed charge coverage ratio were to be tested, our ability to meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio could be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we would meet this ratio at such time. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the ABL Credit Agreement. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these financial tests, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our Credit Agreements or the indentures governing our outstanding notes, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could cause repayment of the debt to be accelerated.\nIf we are not able to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes, our Credit Agreements or our other debt instruments, an event of default under the relevant debt instrument could occur. If an event of default does occur, it could trigger a default under our other debt instruments, prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings, and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments. In addition, we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the applicable debt. Even if we were able to secure additional financing, it may not be available on favorable terms.\nCredit rating downgrades could increase our borrowing costs or otherwise adversely affect us.\nSome of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies. Our credit ratings could change based on, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. Credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a \u201cwatch list\u201d for a possible downgrade or assigned a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d. Although our indebtedness does not include any triggers that would increase existing borrowing rates if there were a ratings downgrade, actual or anticipated changes or downgrades, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could increase our future borrowing costs, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock. If a downgrade were to occur or a negative outlook were to be assigned, it could impact our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt and/or increase the associated costs. In addition, while our credit ratings are important to us, we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a manner that adversely affects our credit ratings.\nThe expected replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate and other interbank offered rates with new benchmark rate indices may have an impact on our financing costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $50.0 million of debt outstanding under facilities with interest rates based on LIBOR. Our Credit Agreements include fallback language that seeks to facilitate an agreement with our lenders on a replacement rate for LIBOR in the event of its discontinuance or that would replace LIBOR with a new benchmark replacement rate upon certain triggering events. We cannot predict what the impact of any such replacement rate would be to our interest expense, however, the discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may result in fluctuating interest rates that may have a negative impact on our interest expense and our profitability. Potential changes to the underlying floating-rate indices and reference rates may have an adverse impact on our liabilities indexed to LIBOR and could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Furthermore, we cannot predict or quantify the time, effort and cost required to transition to the use of new benchmark rates, including with respect to negotiating and implementing any necessary changes to existing contractual agreements, and implementing changes to our systems and processes.\nGENERAL RISK\nUnited States and global economic conditions could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and financial results.\nU.S. and global economic conditions and currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our business and financial results. Recessed global economic conditions and a strong U.S. dollar could affect our business in a number of ways, including causing declines in global demand for consumer tissue and paperboard, and increased competition from foreign manufacturers in the U.S. market. Foreign currency changes can also impact pricing associated with our raw materials such as pulp and equipment purchases impacting our cost structure.\nWe may fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, including key personnel.\nOur ability to effectively run our business depends on our ability to attract, motivate, train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the competitive markets in which we operate. The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience, and can increase our operating and overhead costs. Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, which may negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. The loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Our failure to identify candidates with the leadership skills to manage our organization, and our failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key executives, could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022a classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022stockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our Board of Directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022allowing only our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022supermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 92854, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "CLW"}
