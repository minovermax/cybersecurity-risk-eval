{"cik": "1030749", "company": "GULFMARK OFFSHORE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate globally in challenging and highly competitive markets, and our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider these risks when evaluating us and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. We are also subject to a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that, as of the date of this report, we believe are not as significant as the risks described below. If any of the following risks actually occur, the accuracy of any forward-looking statements made in this report, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading prices of our securities, may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe current downturn in the oil and gas industry has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and revenues, our customers\u2019 ability to pay and our profitability.\nDemand for our vessels and services, and therefore our results of operations, are highly dependent on the level of spending and investment in offshore exploration, development and production by the companies that operate in the energy industry. The energy industry\u2019s level of capital spending is directly related to current and expected future demand for hydrocarbons and the prevailing commodity prices of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Hydrocarbon supply has increased at a faster pace than hydrocarbon demand, despite a significant decrease in exploration and development spending. This has resulted in significant declines in crude oil prices. When our customers experience low commodity prices or come to believe that they will be low in the future, they generally reduce their capital spending for offshore drilling, exploration and field development. The precipitous decline in crude oil prices that began in late 2014 and has reached a 12-year low of less than $30/barrel has resulted in a decrease in the energy industry\u2019s level of capital spending and, if prices continue to decline or remain depressed for an extended period of time, capital spending and demand for our services may remain similarly depressed. There are indications that certain major oil producing nations do not intend to reduce crude oil output. As a result, the current over-supply environment may continue for the foreseeable future unless there is a significant increase in worldwide demand, which may not occur or may occur very slowly. These market conditions negatively affected our 2015 results and are expected to continue to significantly affect future results, particularly if exploration and production activity levels and, therefore, demand for our products and services, as well as our customers\u2019 ability to pay, continue to decline. The decrease in demand for offshore services could cause the industry to cycle into a prolonged downturn. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the oil and natural gas industry, and volatile oil and natural gas prices impact demand for our services.\nDemand for our services depends on activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. The level of exploration, development and production activity is affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf\nprevailing oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf\nexpectations about future prices and price volatility;\n\u25cf\nworldwide supply and demand for oil and gas;\n\u25cf\nthe level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;\n\u25cf\nthe worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u25cf\nthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u25cf\ninternational sanctions on oil producing countries and the lifting of certain sanctions against Iran;\n\u25cf\ncivil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities involving the Middle East, Russia, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf\ncost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nsale and expiration dates of available offshore leases;\n\u25cf\ndemand for petroleum products;\n\u25cf\ncurrent availability of oil and natural gas resources;\n\u25cf\nrate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u25cf\nlocal and international political, environmental and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances; and\n\u25cf\nability of oil and natural gas companies to obtain leases and permits, or obtain funds for capital.\nAn increase in commodity demand and prices will not necessarily result in an immediate increase in offshore drilling activity since our customers\u2019 project development times, reserve replacement needs, expectations of future commodity demand, prices and supply of available competing vessels all combine to affect demand for our vessels. The level of offshore exploration, development and production activity has historically been characterized by volatility, and that volatility is likely to continue. The decline in exploration and development of offshore areas has resulted in a decline in the demand for our offshore marine services and may continue to do so or may worsen. Any such decrease in activity is likely to reduce our day rates and our utilization rates and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or are unable to use future borrowings to fund other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable.\nIf our business does not generate cash flow from operations in the future that is sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness and other capital needs, we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs. If operational performance does not improve significantly and oil companies do not increase spending for exploration and production activities, we may need additional sources of liquidity in the future as a result of an inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our long-term capital needs. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to satisfy our debt obligations and other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u25cf\nrefinancing or restructuring all or a portion of our debt;\n\u25cf\nobtaining alternative financing;\n\u25cf\nselling assets;\n\u25cf\nreducing or delaying capital investments;\n\u25cf\nseeking to raise additional capital; or\n\u25cf\nrevising or delaying our strategic plans.\nWe cannot assure you, however, that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations and capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any failure to make required or scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Further, if for any reason we are unable to satisfy our covenants, debt service or repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such debt, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all such outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable (which could in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements), the lenders under our Multicurrency Facility Agreement and Norwegian Facility Agreement, (as defined in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Long-Term Debt,\u201d) as applicable, could terminate their commitments to loan money, and such lenders could foreclose against our assets securing their borrowings which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to be dependent on our Multicurrency Facility Agreement and Norwegian Facility Agreement for liquidity beginning in 2016. Any further reduction of the commitments under or the value of the collateral securing our Multicurrency Facility Agreement or Norwegian Facility Agreement could reduce or eliminate our ability to borrow under the facility and may require us to repay indebtedness under the facility earlier than anticipated, which would adversely impact our liquidity.\nAs a result of our decline in operating revenues and market outlook, we expect to become dependent on our Multicurrency Facility Agreement and Norwegian Facility Agreement for liquidity beginning in 2016. Due to low commodity prices and other factors, the capital markets have been constrained and if market conditions do not improve and these constraints continue, we will continue to be primarily reliant on our Multicurrency Facility Agreement and Norwegian Facility Agreement, and to the extent available, the cash provided by operating activities, for liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2015, there was approximately $98.2 million of available borrowing capacity under the Multicurrency Facility Agreement and approximately $67.9 million of available borrowing capacity under the Norwegian Facility Agreement, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable facility. See \u201c- If we are unable to comply with the financial covenants in our revolving credit facilities, there could be a default, which could result in an acceleration of repayment of funds that we have borrowed at that time\u201d and Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Long-Term Debt.\u201d\nIf we are unable to comply with the financial covenants in our revolving credit facilities, there could be a default, which could result in an acceleration of repayment of funds that we have borrowed at that time.\nOur Multicurrency Facility Agreement and Norwegian Facility Agreement include numerous financial covenants that are tested quarterly. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. Reduced activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry, such as we are currently experiencing, or the absence of substantial improvements in such activity levels could adversely impact our ability to comply with such covenants in the future. Our failure to comply with any such covenant would result in an event of default under the applicable facility, and may result in a cross-default to other indebtedness. An event of default could prevent us from borrowing under our revolving credit facilities, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our available liquidity. In addition, an event of default could result in our having to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Multicurrency Facility Agreement, Norwegian Facility Agreement and our Senior Notes and in foreclosure of liens on our assets. See Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Long-Term Debt.\u201d\nIn addition, if the OSV industry conditions do not improve, we may in the future cease to be in compliance with the covenants in our Multicurrency Facility Agreement and our Norwegian Facility Agreement that require us to maintain minimum Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d \u201c- Long-Term Debt - Multicurrency Facility Agreement\u201d and \u201c- Long-Term Debt - Norwegian Facility Agreement.\u201d If necessary, we plan to work with the respective lenders to attempt to negotiate any amendments or waivers that may be required in the future. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be able to negotiate acceptable terms with the lenders in these circumstances. In addition, any such amendment or waiver would probably be accompanied by the imposition of additional restrictions and potentially a reduction in amounts available for borrowing under the respective facilities.\nWe have high levels of fixed costs that will be incurred regardless of our level of business activity.\nOur business has high fixed costs. Downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand, weather interruptions or other causes can have a significant negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Some of our fixed costs will not decline during periods of reduced revenue or activity, and we may incur additional operating costs for which we are generally reimbursed by the customer when a vessel is under contract. During times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may incur additional costs associated with the stacking of a vessel, or we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining vessels in that region. A decline in revenue due to lower day rates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in our fixed costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our vessels.\nWe have a number of charters that will expire in 2016 and 2017. Our ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of our customers. Given the highly competitive and historically cyclical nature of our industry, we may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or we may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at rates that are below, and potentially substantially below, existing day rates, or that have terms that are less favorable to us than our existing contracts, or we may be unable to secure contracts for these vessels. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn increase in the supply of offshore supply vessels would likely have a negative effect on charter rates for our vessels, which could reduce our earnings.\nOur industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition. Charter rates for marine supply vessels depend in part on the supply of the vessels. We could experience an increased reduction in demand as a result of the current oversupply of vessels. Excess vessel capacity has resulted from:\n\u25cf\nconstructing new vessels;\n\u25cf\nmoving vessels from one offshore market area to another;\n\u25cf\nconverting vessels formerly dedicated to services other than offshore marine services; and\n\u25cf\ndeclining offshore oil and gas drilling production activities.\nIn the past decade, construction of vessels of the types we operate has increased. Significant new OSV construction and upgrades of existing OSVs has intensified price competition. The resulting increases in OSV supply has depressed OSV utilization and intensified price competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore vessel supply market. As of the date of this report, not all of the vessels currently under construction have been contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. Such price competition could further reduce day rates, utilization rates and operating margins, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur additional asset impairments as a result of reduced demand for certain vessels.\nThe current oversupply of vessels in offshore oil and gas exploration and production markets has resulted in numerous vessels being idled or stacked and in some cases retired or scrapped. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment write-offs could result if, for example, any of our vessels become obsolete or commercially less desirable or their carrying values become excessive due to the condition of the vessel, stacking the vessel, the expectation of stacking the vessel in the near future, a decision to retire or scrap the vessel, changes in technology, market demand or market expectations, or excess spending over budget on a new-build vessel. Asset impairment evaluations are, by their nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets, which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangibles\u201d in Part II, Item 7 and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nWe can provide no assurance that our assumptions and estimates used in our asset impairment evaluations will ultimately be realized or that the current carrying value of our property and equipment, including vessels designated as held for sale, will ultimately be realized.\nAs the markets recover or we change our marketing strategies or for other reasons, we may be required to incur higher than expected costs to return previously stacked vessels to class.\nStacked vessels are not maintained with the same diligence as our marketed fleet. As a result, and depending on the length of time the vessels are stacked, we may incur costs beyond normal drydock costs to return these vessels to active service. These costs are difficult to estimate and may be substantial.\nGovernment regulation and environmental risks can reduce our business opportunities, increase our costs, and adversely affect the manner or feasibility of doing business.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the form of international conventions, federal, state and local laws and laws and regulations in jurisdictions where our vessels operate and are registered. The risks of incurring substantial compliance costs, liabilities and penalties for noncompliance are inherent in offshore marine services operations. Compliance with the Jones Act, as well as with environmental, occupational, health and safety, and vessel and port security laws can reduce our business opportunities and increase our costs of doing business. Additionally, these laws change frequently. Therefore, we are unable to predict with certainty the future costs or other future impact of these laws on our operations and our customers. We could also incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and third party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can avoid significant costs, liabilities and penalties imposed on us as a result of government regulation in the future.\nWe have been adversely affected by a decrease in offshore oil and gas drilling as a result of unconventional crude oil and unconventional natural gas production and the improved economics of producing natural gas and oil from shale.\nThe rise in production of unconventional crude oil and gas resources in North America and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas export facilities around the world are, at least to date, primarily contributing to an over-supplied natural gas market. While production of crude oil and natural gas from unconventional sources is still a relatively small portion of the worldwide crude oil and natural gas production, production from unconventional resources is increasing because improved drilling efficiencies are lowering the costs of extraction. There is an oversupply of natural gas inventories in the United States in part due to the increased development of unconventional crude oil and natural gas resources. Prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of crude oil and natural gas, whether from conventional or unconventional sources, will likely continue to depress crude oil and natural gas prices. Prolonged periods of low natural gas prices have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies, which in turn, results in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services. The rise in production of natural gas and oil, particularly from onshore shale, as a result of improved drilling efficiencies that are lowering the costs of extraction, has resulted in a reduction of capital invested in offshore oil and gas exploration. Because we provide vessels servicing offshore oil and gas exploration, the significant reduction in investments in offshore exploration and development has had a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nFailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws may have an adverse effect on us.\nOur international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary. In order to effectively operate in certain foreign jurisdictions, circumstances may require that we establish joint ventures with local operators or find strategic partners. As a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit. We have an ongoing program of proactive procedures to promote compliance with the FCPA and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, but we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subjected to the FCPA or other similar laws. Our personnel and intermediaries, including our local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which we may be subject. Any allegation that we have violated the FCPA or other similar laws or any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to hazards customary for the operation of vessels that could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately insured or indemnified.\nOur operations are subject to various operating hazards and risks, including:\n\u25cf\ncatastrophic marine disaster;\n\u25cf\nadverse sea and weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nmechanical failure;\n\u25cf\nnavigation errors;\n\u25cf\ncollision;\n\u25cf\noil and hazardous substance spills, containment and clean up;\n\u25cf\nlabor shortages and strikes;\n\u25cf\ndamage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities;\n\u25cf\nwar, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attack and terrorism risks; and\n\u25cf\noutbreak of contagious disease.\nThese risks present a threat to the safety of our personnel and to our vessels, cargo, equipment under tow and other property, as well as the environment. We could be required to suspend our operations or request that others suspend their operations as a result of these hazards. In such event, we would experience loss of revenue and possibly property damage, and additionally, third parties may make significant claims against us for damages due to personal injury, death, property damage, pollution and loss of business.\nWe maintain insurance coverage against many of the casualty and liability risks listed above, subject to deductibles and certain exclusions. We have renewed our primary insurance program for the insurance year 2015-2016. We can provide no assurance, however, that our insurance coverage will be available beyond the renewal periods, or that it will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, we could be exposed to substantial liability.\nWe may not be fully indemnified by our customers for damage to their property or the property of their other contractors. Our contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated. Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in our contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and we could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification provisions of our contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable, void or limited by public policy considerations, including when the cause of the underlying loss or damage is our gross negligence or willful misconduct, when punitive damages are attributable to us or when fines or penalties are imposed directly against us. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Current or future litigation in particular jurisdictions, whether or not we are a party, may impact the interpretation and enforceability of indemnification provisions in our contracts. There can be no assurance that our contracts with our customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect us against all hazards and risks inherent in our operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify us will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including our senior notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could:\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate financing needs;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets.\nWe may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our facilities agreements and the indenture governing our 6.375% senior notes due 2022 restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nWe may not be able to sell vessels to improve our cash flow and liquidity because we may be unable to locate buyers with access to financing or to complete any sales on acceptable terms or within a reasonable timeframe.\nWe may seek to sell some of our vessels to provide liquidity and cash flow. However, given the current downturn in the oil and gas industry, there may not be sufficient activity in the market to sell our vessels and we may not be able to identify buyers with access to financing or to complete any such sales. Even if we are able to locate appropriate buyers for our vessels, any sales may occur on less favorable terms than the terms that might be available in a more liquid market or at other times in the business cycle.\nThe early termination of contracts on our vessels could have an adverse effect on our operations and our backlog may not be converted to actual operating results for any future period.\nSome of the long-term contracts for our vessels and all contracts with governmental entities and national oil companies contain early termination options in favor of the customer, although some have early termination remedies or other provisions designed to discourage the customers from exercising such options. We cannot assure you that our customers would not choose to exercise their termination rights in spite of such remedies or the threat of litigation with us. Until replacement of such business with other customers, any termination could temporarily disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We might not be able to replace such business on economically equivalent terms. In those circumstances, the amount of backlog could be reduced and the conversion of backlog into revenue could be impaired. Additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond our control, a customer may no longer want or need a vessel that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at a lower rate. For these reasons, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of our existing contracts, terminate our contracts without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our contracts. In any case, an early termination of a contract may result in our vessel being idle for an extended period of time. Each of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Fleet Commitments and Backlog\u201d included in Part II, Item 7.\nWe may be unable to collect amounts owed to us by our customers.\nWe typically grant our customers credit on a short-term basis. Related credit risks are inherent as we do not typically collateralize receivables due from customers. We provide estimates for uncollectible accounts based primarily on our judgment using historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer as evidence supporting the receivables valuations stated on our financial statements. However, our receivables valuation estimates may not be accurate and receivables due from customers reflected in our financial statements may not be collectible. Our inability to perform under our contractual obligations, or our customers\u2019 inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations which are subject to foreign government regulation and operating risks.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from foreign sources. We therefore face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, such as:\n\u25cf\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nlegal and governmental regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf\nlanguage and cultural differences;\n\u25cf\npotential vessel seizure or nationalization of assets;\n\u25cf\nimport-export quotas or other trade barriers;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u25cf\nchanges to shipping tax regimes;\n\u25cf\nrisk arising from counterparty conduct;\n\u25cf\nimposition of currency exchange controls; and\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future or whether they might have a material effect on our operations. Our ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations, such as regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nOur subsidiary structure and our operations are in part based on certain assumptions about various foreign and domestic tax laws, currency exchange requirements and capital repatriation laws. While we believe our assumptions are correct, there can be no assurance that taxing or other authorities will reach the same conclusions. If our assumptions are incorrect or if the relevant countries change or modify such laws or the current interpretation of such laws, we may suffer adverse tax and financial consequences, including the reduction of cash flow available to meet required debt service and other obligations.\nDue to the continuous evolution of laws and regulations in the various markets in which we operate, we may be restricted or even lose the right to operate in certain international markets where we currently have a presence.\nMany of the countries in which we operate have laws, regulations and enforcement systems that are largely undeveloped, and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernible even to experienced operators. Further, these laws, regulations and enforcement systems can be subject to frequent change or reinterpretation, sometimes with retroactive effect, and taxes, fees, fines or penalties may be sought from us based on that reinterpretation or retroactive effect. While we endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful, and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of our operations in the jurisdiction. In addition, laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new, unexpected ways that substantially increase our costs, which we may not be able to pass through to our customers. Any changes in laws, regulations or standards that would impose additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur tax expense and effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could be higher if there are changes in tax legislation in countries where we operate, if we lose our tonnage tax qualifications or tax exemptions, if we increase our operations in high tax jurisdictions where we operate, if there are changes in the mix of income and losses we recognize in tax jurisdictions and/or if we elect to repatriate cash from our foreign operations in amounts higher than recent years.\nOur worldwide operations are conducted through our various domestic and foreign subsidiaries and as a result we are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Any material changes in tax law and related regulations, tax treaties or their interpretations where we have significant operations could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and a materially higher tax expense.\nFor example, our North Sea operations based in the U.K. and Norway have special tax incentives for qualified shipping operations, commonly referred to as tonnage tax, which provides for a tax based on the net tonnage capacity of qualified vessels, resulting in significantly lower taxes than those that would apply if we were not a qualified shipping company in those jurisdictions. There is no guarantee that current tonnage tax regimes will not be changed or modified which could, along with any of the above mentioned factors, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our business, operating results and financial condition. Our U.K. and Norway tonnage tax companies are subject to specific disqualification triggers, which, if we fail to manage them, could jeopardize our qualified tonnage tax status in those countries. Certain of the disqualification events or actions are coupled with one or more opportunities to cure or otherwise maintain the tonnage tax qualification but not all are curable. Our qualified Singapore-based vessels are exempt from Singapore taxation through December 2017, with extensions available in certain circumstances beyond 2017, but there is no assurance that extensions will be granted. The qualified Singapore vessels are also subject to specific qualification requirements which, if not met, could jeopardize our qualified status in Singapore.\nIn addition, our worldwide operations may change in the future such that the mix of our income and losses recognized in the various jurisdictions could change. Any such changes could reduce our ability to utilize tax benefits, such as foreign tax credits, and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and tax expense.\nOur reported tax expense reflects our intention to permanently reinvest earnings from certain of our foreign operations and therefore those earnings are not subject to U.S. taxation. In the future, we may elect to decrease the portion of annual foreign earnings we intend to permanently reinvest, and, if so, this would increase our overall effective tax rate upward toward the U.S. federal statutory rate, which is currently 35%. If we should change our intention with regard to our prior years\u2019 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings, we would recognize a charge to current earnings to reflect the effect of U.S. taxation on those prior years\u2019 unremitted foreign earnings and that charge could be significant and material.\nOur income tax expense, or benefit, and effective tax rate are impacted by inclusion of related U.S. earnings, or losses, taxed at the combined U.S. federal and state tax rates, which are subject to tax law changes. In addition, our tax returns are subject to examination and review by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur international operations and new vessel construction programs are vulnerable to currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks as a result of our foreign operations and when we construct vessels abroad. To minimize the financial impact of these risks, we attempt to match the currency of our debt and operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams. We occasionally enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific exposures, which include exposures related to firm contractual commitments in the form of future vessel payments, but we do not speculate in foreign currencies. Because we conduct a large portion of our operations in foreign currencies, any increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the value of applicable foreign currencies could adversely affect our operating revenue or construction costs when translated into U.S. Dollars.\nDoing business through joint venture operations may require us to surrender some control over our assets and may lead to disruptions in our operations and business.\nWe operate in several foreign areas through joint ventures with local companies, in some cases as a result of local laws requiring local company ownership. While the joint venture partner may provide local knowledge and experience, entering into joint ventures often requires us to surrender a measure of control over the assets and operations devoted to the joint venture, and occasions may arise when we do not agree with the business goals and objectives of our joint venture partner, or other factors may arise that make the continuation of the relationship unwise or untenable. Any such disagreements or discontinuation of the relationship could disrupt our operations, put assets dedicated to the joint venture at risk, or adversely affect the continuity of our business. If we are unable to resolve issues with a joint venture partner, we may decide to terminate the joint venture and either locate a different partner and continue to work in the area or seek opportunities for our assets in another market. The unwinding of an existing joint venture could prove to be difficult or time-consuming, and the loss of revenue related to the termination or unwinding of a joint venture and costs related to the sourcing of a new partner or the mobilization of assets to another market could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nVessel construction, enhancement, repair and drydock projects are subject to risks, including delays, cost overruns, and ship yard insolvencies which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur vessel construction, enhancement, repair and drydock projects are subject to risks, including delay and cost overruns, inherent in any large construction project, including:\n\u25cf\nshortages of equipment;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen engineering problems;\n\u25cf\nwork stoppages;\n\u25cf\nlack of shipyard availability;\n\u25cf\nweather interference;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated cost increases;\n\u25cf\nshortages of materials or skilled labor; and\n\u25cf\ninsolvency of the ship repairer or ship builder.\nSignificant cost overruns or delays in connection with our vessel construction, enhancement, repair and drydock projects could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Significant delays could also result, under certain circumstances, in penalties under, or the termination of, long-term contracts under which our vessels operate. The demand for vessels we construct may diminish from anticipated levels, or we may experience difficulty in acquiring new vessels or obtaining equipment to fix our older vessels due to high demand, both circumstances which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Recent global economic issues may increase the risk of insolvency of ship builders and ship repairers, which could adversely affect the cost of new construction and the vessel repairs and could result, under certain circumstances, in penalties under, or termination of, long-term contracts relating to vessels under construction.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could depress vessel prices and utilization and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a competitive industry. The principal competitive factors in the marine support and transportation services industry include:\n\u25cf\nprice, service and reputation of vessel operations and crews;\n\u25cf\nnational flag preference;\n\u25cf\noperating conditions;\n\u25cf\nsuitability of vessel types;\n\u25cf\nvessel availability;\n\u25cf\ntechnical capabilities of equipment and personnel;\n\u25cf\nsafety and efficiency;\n\u25cf\ncomplexity of maintaining logistical support; and\n\u25cf\ncost of moving equipment from one market to another.\nIn addition, an expansion in the supply of vessels in the regions in which we compete, whether through new vessel construction, the refurbishment of older vessels, or the conversion of vessels, could lower charter rates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we have. Competitive bidding and downward pressures on profits and pricing margins could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of our fleet may be subject to seasonal factors.\nOperations in the North Sea are generally at their highest levels during the months from April through August and at their lowest levels from December through February, primarily due to lower construction activity and harsh weather conditions during the winter months affecting the movement of drilling rigs. Vessels operating offshore Southeast Asia are generally at their lowest utilization rates during the monsoon season, which moves across the Asian continent between September and early March. The monsoon season for a specific Southeast Asian location generally lasts about two months. Activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, like the North Sea, is often slower during the winter months when construction projects and other specialized jobs are most difficult, and during the hurricane season from June through November. Operations in any market may be affected by seasonality often related to unusually long or short construction seasons due to, among other things, abnormal weather conditions, as well as market demand associated with changes in drilling and development activities.\nWe are subject to war, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attacks and terrorism risk.\nWar, sabotage, pirate, cyber and terrorist attacks or any similar risk may adversely affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including changes in the insurance markets, disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, refineries, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, offshore rigs and vessels, and communications infrastructures, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, a cyber-attack or an act of piracy or terror. War or risk of war or any such attack may also have an adverse effect on the economy. Insurance coverage can be difficult to obtain in areas of pirate and terrorist attacks resulting in increased costs that could continue to increase. We periodically evaluate the need to maintain this insurance coverage as it applies to our fleet. Instability in the financial markets as a result of war, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attacks or terrorism could also adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could also adversely affect the oil, natural gas and power industries and restrict their future growth.\nA failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee or other third party causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee or other tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nDue to increasing technological advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers or any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber-attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.\nOur U.S. flagged vessels may be requisitioned or purchased by the United States in case of national emergency or a threat to security.\nWe are subject to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which provides that, upon proclamation by the President of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by United States citizens (which includes United States corporations), including vessels under construction in the United States. If our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the federal government, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire, but we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer. The purchase or the requisition for an extended period of time of one or more of our vessels could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Maritime Restrictions established to comply with the Jones Act may have an adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our Class A common stock is subject to certain transfer and ownership restrictions designed to protect our eligibility to engage in Coastwise Trade, including restrictions that limit the maximum permitted percentage of outstanding shares of Class A common stock that may be owned or controlled in the aggregate by non-U.S. citizens to a maximum of 22 percent, which we refer to collectively as the Maritime Restrictions. These Maritime Restrictions:\n\u25cf\nmay cause the market price of our Class A common stock to be lower than the market price of our competitors who may not impose similar restrictions;\n\u25cf\nmay result in transfers to non-U.S. citizens being void and ineffective and, thus, may impede or limit the ability of our stockholders to transfer or purchase shares of our Class A common stock;\n\u25cf\nprovide for the automatic transfer of shares in excess of the maximum permitted percentage, which we refer to as Excess Shares, to a trust for sale and may result in non-U.S. citizens suffering losses from the sale of Excess Shares;\n\u25cf\npermit us to redeem Excess Shares, which may result in stockholders who are non-U.S. citizens being required to sell their Excess Shares of Class A common stock at an undesirable time or price or on unfavorable terms;\n\u25cf\nmay adversely affect our financial condition if we must redeem Excess Shares or if we do not have the funds or ability to redeem the Excess Shares; and\n\u25cf\nmay impede or discourage efforts by a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we do not comply with the Jones Act.\nWe are subject to the Jones Act, which requires that vessels carrying passengers or cargo between U.S. ports in Coastwise Trade be owned and managed by U.S. citizens, and be built in and registered under the laws of the United States. Violations of the Jones Act would result in our losing eligibility to engage in Coastwise Trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against us, including seizure or forfeiture of our vessels, and/or the inability to register our vessels in the United States, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we currently believe we meet the requirements to engage in Coastwise Trade, and the Maritime Restrictions were designed to assist us in complying with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the Jones Act in the future.\nCircumvention or repeal of the Jones Act may have an adverse impact on us.\nThe Jones Act\u2019s provisions restricting Coastwise Trade to vessels controlled by U.S. citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign interests that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by U.S. citizens and otherwise qualifying for Coastwise Trade. Legal challenges against such actions are difficult, costly to pursue and are of uncertain outcome. There have also been attempts to repeal or amend the Jones Act, and these attempts are expected to continue. In addition, the Secretary of Homeland Security may suspend the citizenship requirements of the Jones Act in the interest of national defense. To the extent foreign competition is permitted from vessels built in lower-cost shipyards and crewed by non-U.S. citizens with favorable tax regimes and with lower wages and benefits, such competition could have a material adverse effect on domestic companies in the offshore service vessel industry subject to the Jones Act such as us.\nWe depend on key personnel, and our U.S. citizen requirements may limit our ability to recruit and retain qualified directors and executive officers.\nWe depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key management personnel. There is no assurance that these individuals will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key management personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nAs long as shares of our Class A common stock remain outstanding, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, by whatever title, must be U.S. citizens. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws specify that not more than a minority of directors comprising the minimum number of members of the Board of Directors necessary to constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors (or such other portion as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to comply with applicable law) may be non-U.S. citizens so long as shares of our Class A common stock remain outstanding. Our bylaws provide for similar citizenship requirements with regard to committees of the Board of Directors. As a result, we may be unable to allow a non-U.S. citizen, who would otherwise be qualified, to serve as a director or as our chairman of the board or chief executive officer.\nMaintaining our current fleet size and configuration and acquiring vessels required for additional future growth require significant capital.\nExpenditures required for the repair, certification and maintenance of a vessel typically increase with vessel age. These expenditures may increase to a level at which they are not economically justifiable and, therefore, to maintain our current fleet size we may seek to construct or acquire additional vessels. Also, customers may prefer modern vessels over older vessels, especially in weaker markets. The cost of adding a new vessel to our fleet can range from under $10 million to $100 million and potentially higher.\nWhile we expect our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit facilities to be adequate to fund our existing commitments, including our new-build vessel construction program, our ability to pay these amounts is dependent upon the success of our operations. To date, we have been able to obtain adequate financing to fund all of our commitments. See \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7. We can give no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to build or acquire the vessels required to expand or to maintain our current fleet size and vessel configuration.\nGrowth through acquisitions and investment could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe routinely evaluate potential acquisitions of single vessels, vessel fleets and businesses, and we expect to continue to enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquisition could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management time and focus away from operating our business to integrating the business;\n\u25cf\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resources and other administrative systems and the coordination of various business functions;\n\u25cf\nimplementation of, and changes to, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n\u25cf\ntransition of customers into our operations;\n\u25cf\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries or regions;\n\u25cf\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\u25cf\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions or investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business in general.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities, an increase in amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition.\nWe can give no assurance that we will be able to identify desirable acquisition candidates or that we will have the financial resources necessary to pursue desirable acquisition candidates or be successful in entering into definitive agreements or closing any such acquisition on satisfactory terms. An inability to acquire additional vessels or businesses may limit our growth potential.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees necessary to operate our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Our inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business. In crewing our vessels, we require skilled employees who can perform physically demanding work, often in harsh or challenging environments for extended periods of time. As a result of the volatility of the oil and gas industry and the demanding nature of the work, potential vessel employees may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. Further, we face strong competition within the broader oilfield industry for potential employees, including competition from drilling rig operators, for our fleet personnel. As vessels under our new vessel construction program are placed in service, we may not be able to hire a sufficient number of employees. It is possible that we will have to raise wage rates to attract workers and to retain our current employees. If we are not able to increase our charges to our customers to compensate for wage increases, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we are unable to recruit qualified personnel we may not be able to operate our vessels at full utilization, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse gas effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nThere is a concern that emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that affect the global climate. Climate change, including the impact of global warming, may create physical and financial risk for organizations whose operations are affected by the climate. Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial risks relating to climate change are likely to arise from increasing regulation of GHG emissions, as compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. For example, from time to time legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to reduce GHG emissions. In addition, in the absence of federal GHG legislation, the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions. Depending on the outcome of these or other regulatory initiatives, increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the relevant limitations. Our vessels also operate in foreign jurisdictions that are addressing climate changes by legislation or regulation. Unless and until legislation or regulations are enacted and their terms are finalized, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. In addition, any GHG related legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas produced by our customers. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrior events in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have adversely impacted and are likely to continue to adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nIn the aftermath of the Macondo Incident, the rig explosion and fire and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and gas exploration adopted numerous new regulations and operating procedures. If the new regulations, operating procedures and possibility of increased legal liability are viewed by our current or future customers as a significant increased financial burden on the drilling projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, drillships and other floating rigs could depart the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for other potentially more profitable regions, which would likely adversely affect the demand for our equipment and services. In addition, government agencies could issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that could disrupt or delay drilling operations, increase the cost of drilling operations or reduce the area of operations available for drilling. All of these uncertainties, including such announced and potential changes in laws and regulations, the cost or availability of insurance and the decisions by customers, governmental agencies or other industry participants could result in a reduced demand for our equipment and services or increase our cost of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We cannot reasonably or reliably estimate to what extent any of the foregoing changes may occur, when they may occur, or how severely they may impact us.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may require significant expenditures and cause diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in such matters.\nA decrease in our customer base could adversely affect demand for our services and reduce our revenues.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of offshore energy companies. Our loss of one of these significant customers, if not offset by sales to new or other existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for our services. Also, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed. Such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation, which could adversely affect demand for our vessels and thereby reduce our revenues.\nOur stock price has been volatile and has declined significantly during the period from the fourth quarter of 2014 through the present, and it could decline again.\nThe securities markets in general and our Class A common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility in recent years. The market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in our industry conditions and in the price of crude oil.", "PERMNO": 84808, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "GLF"}
