{"cik": "1033012", "company": "FLAGSTAR BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the current pandemic resulting from COVID-19. In addition to the factors identified elsewhere in this Report, we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business are set forth below.\nThe below description of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described herein or in any such report or document.\nPending Merger Risk Factors\nFailure to complete the proposed merger with NYCB could negatively affect our stock price, our future business or our financial results.\nIf our pending merger with NYCB is not completed for any reason, our business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including a lower stock price.\n\u2022We may experience negative reactions from vendors, customers or employees.\n\u2022We have incurred substantial expenses and may be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, including legal, accounting, and other fees, whether or not the merger is completed.\n\u2022Our management team will have devoted substantial time and resources to matters relating to the merger and would otherwise have devoted their time and resources to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us.\nWe will be subject to uncertainties while our merger with NYCB is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during this period, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving corporation following the merger. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed to operate our business in\nthe ordinary course and to refrain from taking certain actions without NYCB\u2019s consent. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated and our merger with NYCB may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, we and/or NYCB may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. Furthermore, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by us under certain circumstances prior to April 24, 2022, as specified by the Merger Agreement, we will be required to pay a termination fee of $90 million to NYCB.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and we seek another merger or business combination, the market price of our common stock could decline, which could make it more difficult to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration NYCB has agreed to provide in the merger.\nOur ability to complete our pending merger with NYCB is subject to various regulatory approvals, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us.\nBefore our pending merger with NYCB may be completed, NYCB must obtain certain federal and state regulatory approvals, including approval of the FRB, the FDIC, the New York Department of Financial Services or other applicable banking regulators and certain mortgage agencies. These regulators may impose conditions or place restrictions on the completion of the merger, and any such conditions or restrictions could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or causing a termination of the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approvals will be received, the timing of those approval, or whether any conditions will be imposed.\nShareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of our pending merger with NYCB or otherwise negatively affect our business and operations.\nWe have incurred costs to date, and may continue to incur in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with our pending merger with NYCB. The continued incurrence of such litigation costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger.\nBecause the market price of NYCB\u2019s common stock may fluctuate, our shareholders cannot be certain of the precise value of the merger consideration they may receive in our proposed merger with NYCB.\nAt the time our pending merger with NYCB is completed, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive 4.0151 shares of NYCB\u2019s common stock. There was or will be a time lapse between each of the date of the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the shareholders\u2019 meeting to approve the merger and the date on which our shareholders entitled to receive shares of NYCB\u2019s common stock will actually receive such shares. The market value of NYCB\u2019s common stock may fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in NYCB\u2019s and our businesses, operations and prospects, the recent volatility in the prices of securities in global financial markets, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of our and NYCB\u2019s control. Consequently, at the time that our shareholders decided to approve the merger, they did not know the actual market value of the shares of NYCB\u2019s common stock they will receive when the merger is completed. The actual value of the shares of NYCB\u2019s common stock received by our shareholders will depend on the market value of shares of NYCB\u2019s common stock at the time the merger is completed.\nMarket, Interest Rate, Credit and Liquidity Risk\nEconomic and general conditions in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our business.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by economic and market conditions, political uncertainty and social conditions, factors impacting the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, risks associated with an outbreak of a widespread epidemic or pandemic of disease (or widespread fear thereof), bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment, housing supply and confidence in the financial markets, and the sustainability of economic growth. Deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our business segments, the level of credit risk we have assumed, our capital levels, liquidity, and our results of operations. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia, terrorism or other geopolitical events.\nDomestic and international fiscal and monetary policies also affect our business. Central bank actions, particularly those of the Federal Reserve, can affect the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as investment securities and MSRs; their policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict, but could have an adverse impact on our capital requirements and the cost of running our business.\nOur banking business is concentrated in the Michigan market which represents 80% of our retail deposits. The economy in Michigan is largely impacted by the automotive industry. Conditions that negatively impact the automotive business including global shipping disruptions, challenges in the acquisition of raw materials, component parts and computer chips, labor shortages, and other supply chain disruptions could have a negative impact on our banking business.\nUncertainty and the changing circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are having varying effects on us, our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the ultimate extent of the impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, and prospects are uncertain. The pandemic resulted in temporary or permanent closures of many businesses as well as the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities. Although many restrictions have currently been lifted, additional virus variants and their potential impact remain uncertain and there is risk that restrictions could return in the future. As a result, the demand for our products and services may be negatively impacted. Our ongoing response to COVID-19 and our long-term effectiveness while working remotely could have a significant, lasting impact on our operations, financial condition and reputation. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, changes to the economic landscape and competitive factors that may become permanent and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nThe government response to the pandemic to support the economy has been significant including the CARES Act and subsequent government stimulus and COVID relief bills in late 2020 and throughout 2021. Although government intervention is intended to mitigate economic uncertainties, these programs may not be broad or specific enough to mitigate the economic risks of COVID-19 or may cause other economic impacts and uncertainty such as inflation, which may lead to adverse results.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which means changes in interest rates could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the yield curve. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income. Net interest income and mortgage related non-interest income represented 82 percent of our total revenue for the full year-ended December 31, 2021. As a result, changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business, including net interest income, loan origination volume, and the value of our mortgage servicing rights.\nInterest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including different economic conditions and policies of governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities.\nWe are asset sensitive at December 31, 2021, meaning that if interest rates increase, our net interest income may generally increase and therefore have a positive effect on our financial results. However, our mortgage business, and therefore noninterest income, is likely to decrease with higher interest rates. Furthermore, asymmetrical changes in interest rates, such as if short-term rates increase at a slower rate than long-term rates, could add to the adverse effect on our profitability as the anticipated increase in net interest income will not be realized as quickly as the decrease in mortgage-related revenue. Any substantial or unexpected changes in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business and the financial condition and results of operations.\nSee MD&A - Market Risk for our net interest income sensitivity testing.\nRising mortgage rates and adverse changes in mortgage market conditions could reduce mortgage revenue.\nIn 2021, approximately 69 percent of our revenue was derived from our Mortgage Origination segment which includes activities related to the origination and sale of residential mortgages. The residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to changes in interest rates, especially long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates generally increase the volume of mortgage originations, while higher interest rates generally cause that volume to decrease. Therefore, our mortgage performance is typically correlated to fluctuations in interest rates, primarily the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate. Historically, mortgage origination volume and sales for the Bank and for other financial institutions have risen and fallen in response to these and other factors. An increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in our mortgage production volume could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate was 1.52 percent at December 31, 2021, and averaged 1.44 percent during 2021, 55 basis points higher than average rates experienced during 2020. The sustained lower rates experienced throughout 2021 positively impacted the mortgage market including our loan origination volume and refinancing activity, which may not persist.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. Adverse market conditions, including increased volatility, changes in interest rates and mortgage spreads and reduced market demand, could result in greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors. A prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may result in a reduction of our loan mortgage production volume and could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage origination business is also subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market. The cyclical nature of our industry could lead to periods of growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of declines and losses in such markets. Seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. One of the primary influences on our\nmortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans, which is affected by prevailing interest rates, housing supply and demand, residential construction trends, and overall economic conditions. If we are unable to respond to the cyclical nature of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations or relying on the strength of our other product offerings during cyclical downturns, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in actual repayments and market expectation for higher levels of repayments in the future which have a negative impact on MSR fair value. Conversely, higher rates typically drive lower repayments which results in an increase in the MSR fair value. We utilize derivatives to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the MSRs. We may have basis risk and our risk management strategies, which rely on assumptions or projections, may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, interest rate volatility, convexity, credit spreads, or prepayment speeds, and, as a result, the change in the fair value of MSRs may negatively impact earnings.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve continues to use quantitative easing programs, including buying longer duration securities, resulting in disruptions to the mortgage-backed securities market. There is a risk that the Federal Reserve may take additional actions in the future or elect to stop their current actions, or reduce their balance sheet through sales, which could disrupt the market and have an adverse impact on our mortgage gain on sale or other financial results. Further, the impact of these actions has caused the financial instruments we use to manage our interest rate and market risks to be less effective at times, which could have a materially adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nMortgage forbearance levels and delayed foreclosures due to federal legislation could result in a decrease in service fee income and an increase in service costs.\nWe have provided mortgage forbearance in accordance with federal legislation for single-family, federally backed mortgages, such as those that we service which underlie our mortgage servicing rights, and have chosen to provide additional forbearance we believe are in the best interests of borrowers. In addition, we waived fees for an extended time period in the early portion of the pandemic as customers dealt with the crisis, which we may again do in the future. Additionally, as many borrowers exit forbearance, strain may be placed on our operations. These factors individually or in combination could result in a reduction in servicing fee income and a higher cost to service. Our actions could result in financial, operational, credit, enforcement and compliance risk as we navigate government requirements and our ability to modify our systems to account for these changes while maintaining an adequate internal control structure.\nWe are not aging receivables for customers who have been granted a payment holiday, payment deferral, or forbearance. Therefore, there is a risk that after the forbearance period is complete, customers may still be unable to make their payments, resulting in delinquencies at a higher rate than what is typical and a higher percentage of loans in nonaccrual status. Additionally, for consumer loans, current payments typically provide the primary evidence of a borrower\u2019s ability and intent to repay the loan. Therefore, during the forbearance, deferral, or payment holiday period we may not be able to discern which loans can be repaid and which require timely action to manage the potential for loss to a lower level. Consequently, when a borrower is unable to repay the loan, our losses could be higher than we have experienced in the past or that are contemplated in our ACL.\nSee MD&A - Payment Deferrals for details on borrowers currently participating in a forbearance program.\nWe are highly dependent on the Agencies to buy mortgage loans that we originate. Changes in these entities and changes in the manner or volume of loans they purchase or their current roles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family residential loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. During the year-ended December 31, 2021, we sold approximately 67 percent of our mortgage loans originated to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and 11 percent to Ginnie Mae. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, their concentration limits with respect to loans purchased from us, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs which may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or could cause us to take other actions that would be materially detrimental.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward for them to emerge from conservatorship is unclear. Their roles could be reduced, modified or eliminated as a result of regulatory actions and the nature of their\nguarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements. The elimination or modification of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could create additional competition in the market and significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe originate non-conforming and other nonqualifying residential mortgage loans, including \"jumbo\" and non-owner-occupied residential mortgage loans for sale into the private loan securitization market through a 144A offering and through whole loan sales. Demand for these loans or securities can change based on economic conditions which may adversely impact our ability to sell them.\nJumbo residential mortgage loans have principal balances that exceed the applicable conforming loan limits, as specified by the FHFA, known as the National Conforming Loan Limit (\"Jumbo Loans\"). We originate Jumbo Loans and hold these loans in our HFS portfolio prior to sale. Jumbo Loans, non-owner occupied loans, and other nonqualifying residential mortgage loans tend to be less liquid than conforming loans, which may make it more difficult for us to sell these loans if investor demand decreases. If we are unable to sell these loans, they remain in our HFS portfolio and we retain the pricing and credit risk. Further, these loans remain on the balance sheet utilizing capital which could impact our overall balance sheet management strategy.\nChanges in the servicing, origination, or underwriting guidelines or criteria required by the Agencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to follow specific guidelines or criteria that impact the way we originate, underwrite or service loans. Guidelines include credit standards for mortgage loans, our staffing levels and other servicing practices, the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge, modification standards and procedures, and the amount of non-reimbursable advances.\nWe cannot negotiate these terms, which are subject to change at any time, with the Agencies. A significant change in these guidelines, which decreases the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services, could decrease our revenues or increase our costs, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the insurance provided by the FHA could also have broad adverse market implications. The fees that we are required to pay to the Agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which oversees LIBOR, formally announced that it could not assure the continued existence of LIBOR in its current form beyond the end of 2021 and that an orderly transition process to one or more alternative benchmarks should begin. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions organized by the Federal Reserve, announced that it had selected a modified version of the unpublished Broad Treasuries Financing Rate as the preferred alternative reference rate for U.S. dollar obligations. This rate, now referred to as \"SOFR\", which was first published during the beginning of 2018, is based on actual transactions in certain portions of overnight repurchase agreement markets for certain U.S. Treasury obligations.\nIn November 2020, the FCA announced that it would continue to publish LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether, or in what form, LIBOR will continue to exist after that date. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, revenue and expenses associated with interest rates and underlying valuation assumptions on our loans, deposits, obligations, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates and models that utilize LIBOR curves may be adversely affected. Additionally, there continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of the LIBOR transition, including with respect to the acceptance and use of SOFR or other alternative benchmark rates. The characteristics of these new rates are not identical to the benchmarks they seek to replace, will not produce the exact economic equivalent as those benchmarks, and may perform differently in a variety of market conditions compared to those benchmarks. We could also become subject to litigation and other types of disputes as a consequence of the transition from LIBOR to SOFR or another alternative reference rate, which could subject us to increased legal expenses, payment of monetary damages and reputational harm.\nTo effectively manage our MSR concentration risk, we may have to sell our MSRs when market conditions are not optimal or hold MSRs at a level which is punitive to our Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) under Basel III.\nWe are subject to capital standards requirements, including requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and those developed by the Bank's regulators based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III established a qualifying criteria for regulatory capital, including limitations on the amount of DTAs and MSRs that may be held without triggering higher capital requirements. Effective January 1, 2020, Basel III (post-regulatory simplification) limits the amount of MSRs and DTAs each to 25 percent of CET1. Volatility of interest rates, market disruption or the financial weakness of some traditional buyers of mortgage servicing rights could cause uncertainty with respect to our ability to sell mortgage servicing rights. Should the level of mortgage servicing rights exceed 25 percent of common equity tier one capital, we are required to deduct the excess in determining our regulatory capital levels. If we are unable to sell mortgage servicing rights on a timely basis, there could be negative impacts to our regulatory capital or an impact on our pricing for mortgage loans which could negatively impact our mortgage origination business and our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $392 million in MSRs and an MSR to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 15.3 percent. We produced, on average, approximately $67.25 million of new MSRs per quarter in 2021 and we expect to continue to generate MSRs going forward. Considering the volume of MSRs that we generate, we sell MSRs from time to time to manage the concentration of this asset. In 2021, we sold $164 million in MSRs to third-parties and also delivered $9 billion of outstanding principal via flow sale arrangements, in which Flagstar assigns the servicing right to a third-party investor at the time of sale and the rights, risks, and rewards of holding the MSR asset are never titled in the name of Flagstar. While our established plan to manage our MSR concentration incorporates our production volumes and required sales, no assurance can be given that we will be able to do so at times and prices that we believe appropriate. Additionally, to manage our MSR concentration, we may have to sell our MSRs at a price less than their fair value due to market constraints present at the time of sale which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRefer to MD&A - Regulatory Capital Simplification and Note 18 for more detail.\nOur ACL could be too low to sufficiently cover future credit losses. Our estimate of expected lifetime credit losses is imperfect and requires significant management judgment.\nOur ACL, which reflects our estimate of expected lifetime losses in the HFI loan portfolio and our reserve for unfunded commitments, at December 31, 2021, may not be sufficient to cover actual future credit losses. If this allowance is insufficient, future provisions for credit losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting our loans; but losses nevertheless occur in the ordinary course of business. We establish an allowance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The determination of an appropriate level of allowance is a subjective process that requires significant management judgment, including determination of the reasonable and supportable forecast period, forecasting economic conditions and the qualitative assessment of how the forecasted economic conditions impacts each loan portfolio. New information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, failure of borrowers and guarantors to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ACL. Moreover, our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our ACL and may recommend we increase the amount of our ACL based upon their judgment, which may be different from that of Management.\nOur ACL calculations include a reasonable and supportable two year forecast period which reverts to the long-term historical average over one year. Inaccuracies in our forecast or future changes in economic conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from the forecast used in our calculations and our credit loss provision may increase or our ACL may not be sufficient to cover losses sustained, particularly for the impacted industries.\nThe current pandemic has resulted in the environment changing rapidly resulting in the increased risk of inaccurate forecasts because they depend upon significant judgments and estimates, which can be even more challenging in an environment of uncertainty. Furthermore, the significance of government stimulus and related programs may make forecasting economic conditions more challenging and potentially less consistent with historical data. The calculation for ACL is complex and the associated risk could negatively impact our results of operations and may place stress on our internal controls over financial reporting.\nConcentration of loans held-for-investment in certain geographic locations and markets may increase the magnitude of potential losses should defaults occur.\nOur HFI residential mortgage loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in certain states, including California and Michigan which comprise approximately 55 percent of the portfolio. In addition, our commercial loan portfolio has a concentration of Michigan-lending relationships. Approximately 41 percent of our CRE loans are collateralized by properties in Michigan, and 30 percent of our C&I borrowers are located in Michigan. These concentrations have made, and will continue to make, our loan portfolio susceptible to downturns in these local economies and the real estate and mortgage markets in these areas. Adverse conditions that are beyond our control may affect these areas, including unemployment, inflation, recession, natural disasters, declining property values, municipal bankruptcies and other factors which could increase both the probability and severity of defaults in our loan portfolio, reduce our ability to generate new loans and negatively affect our financial results.\nOur home builder finance portfolio had $1.0 billion in outstanding loan commitments at December 31, 2021. The home builder lending portfolio contains secured and unsecured loans within our CRE and C&I portfolios. Our lending platform originates loans throughout the U.S., with regional offices in Houston, Phoenix and Denver. Our home builder lending business may be impacted by overall economic conditions in the areas builders operate as well as new home construction rates and trends.\nConcentration of loans held-for-investment to specific borrowers may increase the magnitude of potential losses should defaults occur.\nCommercial loans, excluding our warehouse loans, generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate loans due to the more complex nature of underwriting. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2021, our largest CRE and C&I borrowers had outstanding loans of $175 million and $107 million, respectively. Further, we have commitments up to $185 million in our CRE and C&I portfolios. As such, a default by one of our larger borrowers could result in a significant loss relative to our ACL. Additionally, secured loans, including residential and commercial real estate, may experience changes in the underlying collateral value due to adverse market conditions which could result in increased charge-offs in the event of a loan default.\nAt December 31, 2021, our adjustable-rate warehouse lines of credit granted to other mortgage lenders was $12 billion of which $5 billion was outstanding. There may be risks associated with the mortgage lenders that borrow from the Bank, including credit risk, inadequate underwriting, and potential fraud against the Bank. At December 31, 2021, our largest borrower had an outstanding balance of $274 million. A default by one of our larger warehouse borrowers could result in a significant loss relative to our ACL. Additionally, adverse changes to industry competition, mortgage demand and the interest rate environment may have a negative impact on warehouse lending.\nLiquidity risk may affect our ability to meet obligations and impact our ability to grow our business.\nWe require substantial liquidity to repay our customers' deposits, fulfill loan demand, meet borrowing obligations, and fund our operations under both normal and unforeseen circumstances which may cause liquidity stress. Our liquidity could be impaired by our inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of deposits. Our access to and cost of liquidity is dependent on various factors including, but not limited to, declining financial results; balance sheet and financial leverage; disruptions in the capital markets; counterparty availability; interest rate fluctuations; general economic conditions; and legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing funding transactions. A material deterioration in these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit or servicer standing with counterparties or collateral advance rates, resulting in higher cash outflows which could require us to raise capital or obtain additional access to liquidity. If we are restricted from accessing certain funding sources by our regulators, are unable to arrange for new financing on acceptable terms, or default on any of the covenants imposed upon us by our borrowing facilities, then we may have to limit our growth, reduce the number of loans we are able to originate, or take actions that could have other negative effects on our operations.\nWe are a holding company and are, therefore, dependent on the Bank for funding of obligations.\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of the Bank and cash on hand, our ability to service our debt, including interest payments on our senior notes and trust preferred securities; pay dividends; repurchase shares of our common stock; pay for certain services we purchase from the Bank; and cover other operating expenses, depend upon available cash on hand and the receipt of dividends from the Bank. The holding company had cash and cash equivalents of $213.2 million at December 31, 2021, to meet future cash needs, dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt service coverage. Operating expenses, which include costs paid to the Bank, totaled $24 million for the year-ended December 31, 2021. The declaration and payment of dividends by the Bank on all classes of its capital stock are subject to the discretion of the Bank's Board of Directors and to applicable regulatory and legal limitations. If the Bank does not, or cannot, make sufficient dividend payments to us, we may not be able to service or repay our debt when it comes due, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or could cause us to take other actions which could be materially detrimental to our shareholders.\nRegulatory Risk\nWe depend upon having FDIC insurance to raise deposit funding at reasonable rates. Future changes in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments could adversely affect our earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to substantially revise its regulations for determining the amount of an institution's deposit insurance premiums. Consequently, the FDIC has defined the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average Tier 1 Capital. Our assessment rate is determined through the use of a scorecard that combines our CAMELS ratings with certain other financial information. Changes in the level and mix of these financial components in the scorecard may result in a higher assessment rate. The FDIC may determine that we present a higher risk to the DIF than other banks due to various factors. These factors include significant risks relating to interest rates, loan portfolio and geographic concentration, concentration of high credit risk loans, increased loan losses, regulatory compliance, existing and future litigation, and other factors. As a result, we could be subject to higher deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future that could adversely affect our earnings.\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions and/or operating restrictions.\nWe are subject to government legislation and regulation, including, but not limited to, the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts, which require financial institutions to develop programs to detect money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. If detected, financial institutions are obligated to report such activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury. These regulations require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to establish and maintain a relationship with a financial institution. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines, sanctions or restrictions that could have a materially adverse effect on our strategic initiatives and operating results, and could require us to make changes to our operations and the customers that we serve.\nCurrent laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change and, in certain instances, state and federal law may conflict. Any new laws and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive, or otherwise adversely affect our business. If our risk management and compliance programs prove to be ineffective, incomplete or inaccurate, we could suffer unexpected losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, our financial condition, and/or our reputation. As part of our federal regulators' enforcement authority, significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, consent orders, or other regulatory actions can be assessed against the Bank. Such actions could require us to make changes to our operations, including the customers that we serve, and may have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nThe Company and other large financial institutions may become subject to increased scrutiny and more extensive or intense legal, regulatory and supervisory requirements than under the previous presidential and congressional administration. In addition, changes in key personnel at the agencies that regulate the Company, including the federal banking regulators, may result in differing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines and potentially more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties.\nAdditionally, the CARES Act was passed quickly and regulators rapidly issued clarifying guidance and operationalized programs, such as the PPP. As a result, there is risk that subsequent interpretations of guidance or aggressive assertions of wrongdoing in regards to laws, regulations, or applications of guidance could cause an adverse impact to our\nfinancial results or our internal controls. We also may face an increased risk of client disputes, litigation and governmental as well as regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions.\nOperational Risk\nA failure of our information technology systems could cause operational losses and damage to our reputation.\nOur businesses are increasingly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions and data efficiently and accurately. If any of our internal information technology systems fail, we may be unable to conduct business for a period of time, which may impact our financial results if that interruption is sustained. In addition, our reputation with our customers or business partners may suffer, which could have a further, long-term impact on our financial results.\nOur reliance on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure could cause operational losses or business interruptions.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practices, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. The risks associated with the vendor activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. Our Vendor Management department provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships. Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships and is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.\nIncreased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party and may result in legal costs, regulatory fines or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could result in regulatory noncompliance, adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased costs.\nBecause we conduct part of our business over the internet and outsource a significant number of our critical functions, including IT, to third parties, our operations depend on our third-party service providers to maintain and operate their own technology systems. To the extent these third parties\u2019 systems fail, despite our monitoring and contingency plans, we may be unable to conduct business or provide certain services, and we may face financial and reputational losses as a result.\nWe face operational risks due to the high volume and the high dollar value of transactions we process.\nWe rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a wide variety of transactions. Many of the transactions we process may be of high dollar value, such as those related to mortgage lending and warehouse advances. In 2021, we originated a total of $50 billion in residential mortgage loans and processed $131 billion of warehouse lending advances. We face operational risk from, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems or failures of those of our suppliers or counterparties, compliance failures, cyber-attacks, technology failures, system failures, vendor failures, unforeseen problems related to system implementations or upgrades, business continuation and disaster recovery issues, and other external events. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a financial loss, regulatory action or damage to our reputation.\nWe may lose market share if we are not able to respond to technological change and introduce new products and services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly dependent on technology. We may not be able to respond to technological innovations as quickly as our competitors do. Certain of our competitors are making significantly greater investments and allocating significantly more in financial resources toward technological innovations and digital offerings than we historically have. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers and introduce competitive products in a cost-efficient manner depends on our responsiveness to technological advances, investment in new technology as it becomes available, and obtaining and maintaining related essential personnel. Furthermore, the introduction of new technologies and products, by\nfinancial technology companies and platforms may adversely affect our ability to maintain our customer base, obtain new customers or successfully grow our business. The failure to respond to the product demands of our customers, due to cost, proficiency, technology, the way we conduct business or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our business and, therefore, on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe collect, store and transfer our customers\u2019 and employees' personally identifiable information and other sensitive information. Any cybersecurity attack or other compromise to the security of that information, our computer systems or networks, or the systems or networks of third-party providers upon which we rely, could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nAs a part of conducting our business, we receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other sensitive data either on our network, in the cloud, or on third party networks and systems. We, and our third-party providers, have been in the past and may in the future be subject to cybersecurity attacks. We, and our third-party providers, are regularly the subject of attempted attacks and the ability of the attackers continues to grow in sophistication. Further, we may not know that an attack occurred until well after the event. Even after discovering an attempt or breach occurred, we may not know the extent of the impact of the attack for some period of time. Such attacks may interrupt our business or compromise the sensitive data of our customers and employees. There can be no assurance that a cybersecurity incident will not have a material impact on our business in the future. As a result, we could suffer material financial and reputational losses in the future from any of these or other types of attacks or the public perception that such an attack on our systems or those of our vendors has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct.\nCybersecurity risks for banking institutions have increased significantly due to opportunistic threats related to COVID-19, supply chain attacks, foreign actors, new technologies, the reliance on technology to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication of organized crime and hackers. A cybersecurity attack, information security breach, phishing or other social engineering incident could adversely impact our ability to conduct business due to the potential costs for remediation, protection and litigation as well as reputational damage with customers, business partners and investors. There are myriad federal, state, local and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and sensitive data. We have policies, processes, and systems in place that are intended to meet the requirements of those laws, including security systems to prevent unauthorized access. Nevertheless, those processes and systems may be inadequate. Also, since we rely upon vendors or other third parties to handle some personally identifiable data on our behalf, we may be responsible if such data is compromised or subject to a cybersecurity attack while in the custody and control of those vendors or third parties.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the Bank instituting a work-from-home policy for all staff that are able to work remotely, exposing us to increased cybersecurity risk. Many of our employees are likely to continue working remotely on a full-time or part-time basis in the future. Increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cyber criminals to exploit vulnerabilities. We have observed an increase in attempted malicious activity from third parties directed at the Bank and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to increased stress caused by the crisis and from balancing family as well as work responsibilities at home, such as attempts to obtain personally identifiable information. Cybercriminals may be opportunistic about fears about COVID-19 and the higher number of people accessing the network remotely by including malware in emails that appear to include documents providing legitimate information for protecting oneself from COVID-19. The Bank may also be exposed to this risk if the operations of any of its vendors that provide critical services to the Bank are adversely impacted by cyberattacks. Furthermore, with the increased use of virtual private network (\u201cVPN\u201d) servers, there is a risk of security misconfiguration in VPNs resulting in exposing sensitive information on the internet. A significant and sustained malware or other cybersecurity attack targeted at the Bank or any of its vendors that provide critical services to the Bank could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to conduct our overall operations.\nPrivacy laws are continually evolving and many state and local jurisdictions have laws that differ from federal law or privacy policies, and some of those policies or laws may conflict. For example, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020, provides consumers with the right to know what personal data is being collected, know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom, and opt out of the sale of their personal data, among other rights. If we, or a third-party provider upon which we rely, fail to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state, local or international laws and regulations or experience any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other sensitive data, those events could damage the reputation of our business and discourage potential users from utilizing our products and services. In addition, insurance may not cover the cost of mitigating identity theft concerns or responding to and mitigating a cybersecurity incident, and we may be subject to fines or legal proceedings by governmental agencies or consumers. Any of these events could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 has exposed our customers and employees to health risks that has caused changes in our workplace, place of business and how our customers behave. As we have and continue to return to in-person activities we may be exposed to additional risks that could have a materially adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank has instituted a work-from-home policy for all staff that are able to work remotely until the risks related to the pandemic sufficiently abate. Working remotely creates new challenges and the pace of change required to address government programs and forbearance increases the risk of internal control failure. In addition, consumers affected by the changed economic and market conditions as a result of a pandemic may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over, including decreases in discretionary spending on a permanent or long-term basis. Almost all of our branch lobbies have re-opened, but at times we may have to limit these branches to drive through service only or temporarily close them to customers due to the health crisis. This change in business could also result in changes in consumer behavior for which we may not be prepared.\nAs employees return to work and business is conducted in-person with customers, employees and customers could be exposed to COVID-19. Although the Bank believes it has taken the appropriate precautionary measures against the spread of COVID-19 to keep our employees and customers safe, the actions we have taken may not be adequate and may expose us to additional liability.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\nServicing revenue makes up approximately 23 percent of our total revenue and the business contributed approximately $6 billion in average custodial deposits during 2021. At December 31, 2021, we had relationships with ten owners of MSRs, excluding ourselves, for which we act as subservicer for the mortgage loans they own. Due to the limited number of relationships, discontinuation of existing agreements with those third parties or adverse changes in contractual terms could have a significant negative impact to our mortgage servicing revenue. The terms and conditions in which a master servicer may terminate subservicing contracts are broad and could be exercised at the discretion of the master servicer without requiring cause. Additionally, the master servicer directs the oversight of custodial deposits associated with serviced loans and, to the extent allowable, could choose to transfer the oversight of the Bank's custodial deposits to another depository institution. Further, as servicer or subservicer of loans, we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold by us, we make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the Agencies, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower or we may be required to pay fees. We may also be subject to litigation relating to these representations and warranties which may result in significant costs. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies we have available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. We also face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected.\nFor certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit or other losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims for which we did not satisfy our obligations, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or an increase to noninterest expense. We may incur significant costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our servicing business and, as a result, our profitability.\nOur representation and warranty reserve, which is based on an estimate of probable future losses, was $4 million at December 31, 2021. The pipeline represents the UPB for loans the Agencies identified as potentially needing to be repurchased, and the estimated probable loss associated with these loans is included in the reserve. While we believe the level of the reserve to be appropriate, the reserve may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized for which we may be subsequently required to repurchase, pay fines or fees, or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties. Additionally, the pipeline could increase substantially without warning. Our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, may review our representation and warranty reserve for losses and may recommend or require us to increase our reserve, based upon their judgment, which may differ from that of Management.\nWe utilize third-party mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance, and operational risk.\nIn 2021, approximately 66 percent of our residential first mortgage volume depended upon the use of third-party mortgage originators, i.e. mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders, who are not our employees. These third parties originate mortgages or provide services to many different banks and other entities. Accordingly, they may have relationships with, or loyalties to, such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us. Failure to maintain good relations with such third-party mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party mortgage originators to originate and document the mortgage loans we purchase or originate. While we perform due diligence on the mortgage companies with whom we do business as well as review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance, we have less control over these originators than employees of the Bank.\nDue to regulatory scrutiny, our third-party mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule issued by the CFPB establishes comprehensive mortgage disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The rule requires certain disclosures to be provided to consumers in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan. The rule also mandates the use of specific disclosure forms, timing of communicating information to borrowers, and certain record keeping requirements. The ongoing administrative burden and the system requirements associated with complying with these rules or potential changes to these rules could impact our mortgage volume and increase costs. In addition, these arrangements with third-party mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and restrictions in the future.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, The Consumer Protection Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discriminatory and other lending practices by lenders, including financial institutions. Mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending laws and regulations imposed by federal Regulatory Agencies as well as the relatively independent and diverse operating channels in which loans are originated. As we originate loans through various channels, we, and our third-party originators, are especially impacted by these laws and regulations and are required to implement appropriate policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with fair lending laws and regulations and to avoid lending practices that result in the disparate treatment of, or disparate impact to, borrowers across our various locations under multiple channels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, by us, or our third-party originators, could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers, changes in business practices, or other imposed penalties.\nNew lines of business, products, or services may subject us to unknown risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or where there is a conflict between state and federal law. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could result in a materially negative effect on our operating results. New lines of business and/or new products or services also could subject us to additional or conflicting legal or regulatory requirements, increased scrutiny by our regulators and other legal risks.\nOther Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings.\nAt any given time, we are involved with a number of legal and regulatory examinations as a part of the routine reviews conducted by regulators and other parties, which may involve consumer protection, employment, tort, and numerous other laws and regulations. Proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on our business activities, or other results adverse to us, which could materially and negatively affect our business. If such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations. We have been, and may be in the future, subject to stockholder class and derivative actions, which could seek significant damages or other relief. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a materially adverse effect on our business, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop, making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal or regulatory proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal or regulatory proceedings where we face a risk of loss. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question. As a result, our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.\nFor further information, see Note 19 - Legal Proceedings, Contingencies and Commitments.\nWe may be required to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts in accordance with certain state laws despite the Federal preemption under the National Bank Act.\nIn 2018, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held that California state law requiring mortgage servicers to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts was not, as a matter of law, preempted by the National Bank Act (Lusnak v. Bank of America). This ruling goes against the position that regulators, national banks, and other federally-chartered financial institutions have taken regarding the preemption of state-law mortgage escrow interest requirements. The opinion issued by the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals is legal precedent only in certain parts of the western United States. We are defending similar litigation in California, and are currently appealing a federal district court judgment against us in that case to the Ninth Circuit. We are arguing that the Lusnak case was wrongly decided; we believe our situation can be distinguished from Lusnak as a matter of law and California\u2019s interest on escrow law should be preempted as a matter of fact. If the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding is more broadly adopted by other Federal Circuits, including those covering states that currently have enacted, or in the future may enact, statutes requiring the payment of interest on escrow balances or if we would be required to retroactively credit interest on escrow funds, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nLoss of certain personnel, including key members of the Company's management team, and increasing competition for talent could adversely affect the Company.\nWe are, and will continue to be, dependent upon our management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. In addition, COVID-19 increases the risk that certain senior executive officers or a member of the Board of Directors could become ill, causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. Furthermore, because of the nature of the disease, multiple people working in close proximity could also become ill, potentially resulting in the same department having extended absences simultaneously; a scenario which could negatively impact the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the Bank.\nThe ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees is an increasingly competitive factor in our industry. This factor presents greater risk when we are expanding into new markets, developing new product lines, or significantly enhancing staffing in certain areas, particularly technology. This competition leads to increased expenses in affected business areas. In addition, the transition to increased work-from-home, which is likely to survive the COVID-19 pandemic for many\ncompanies, may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. Limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions can compensate their officers and employees, including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of Dodd-Frank, may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions, including us, to compete with unregulated companies for talent.", "PERMNO": 84734, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "FBC"}
