{"cik": "1000697", "company": "WATERS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A:\nRisk Factors\nThe Company is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\nRISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)\nPANDEMIC\nThe adverse effects of the continuing COVID-19\npandemic and an indeterminate recovery period has negatively affected the Company\u2019s business and operations, and may continue to negatively impact the Company\u2019s business and operations, the nature and extent of such impact is highly uncertain.\nThe impact of the global COVID-19\npandemic over the last two years has resulted in a widespread public health crisis. The COVID-19\npandemic has caused significant volatility and continued spread throughout the United States and globally, which has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the Company\u2019s business. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in the regions most impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. In response, governments of most countries, including the United States, as well as private businesses, have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of COVID-19.\nSuch measures have had and are expected to continue to have adverse impacts on the United States and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration, and have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations, including Company sales, supply chain and cash flow.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has and may continue to have a significant impact on our supply chain if our manufacturing facilities or those of third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. The current logistic and supply chain issues being experienced throughout the world have made it more difficult for us to manage our operations and as such we cannot provide any assurances that any further disruptions in the logistics and supply chains will not have a material impact on our future financial results and cashflows. We have and may continue to have disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products.\nIn addition, in the event of a sustained downturn in customer demand or other economic conditions due to the COVID-19\npandemic could result in material charges related to bad debt or inventory write-offs, restructuring charges, or impairments of long-lived assets, including both tangible and intangible assets. Furthermore, such a sustained downturn in financial markets and asset values could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of capital, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has caused the Company to take measures to modify its business practices. We have invested in maintaining safe work environments for our employees by, among other things, adding work from home flexibility, adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay at home, increasing cleaning protocols across all work locations, initiating regular communications regarding the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic, establishing new physical distancing and safety procedures for employees, modifying workplaces as appropriate and implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19\ncases and potential exposure. Further, the Company has modified policies regarding employee travel and physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. The Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of, among others, its employees, customers, distributors and suppliers. The Company\u2019s change in business practices may result in the Company experiencing lower workforce efficiency and productivity. In addition, as Company employees work from home\nand access the Company\u2019s systems remotely, the Company may be subject to heightened security risks, including the risks of cyber-attacks. Although we are in re-opening\nprocesses for our corporate and other facilities, such processes may face future closure requirements. There is no certainty that the Company measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19,\nand the Company\u2019s ability to perform critical functions could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected if any of the Company\u2019s key management employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time, including as a result of illness.\nThe degree to which COVID-19\nultimately affects the Company\u2019s business, financial results and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the availability, distribution, acceptance and efficacy of a vaccine, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nRISKS RELATED TO MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nThe Company\u2019s international operations may be negatively affected by political events, wars or terrorism and regulatory changes, related to either a specific country or a larger region. These potential political, currency and economic disruptions, as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nApproximately 72% and 71% of the Company\u2019s net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were outside of the United States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company has considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the U.K., as well as significant subcontractors located in Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales and operations are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in the political, regulatory and economic environment, in particular, uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy; the effect of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of European countries; the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism; the instability and possible dissolution of the Euro as a single currency; sudden movements in a country\u2019s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country\u2019s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; tariffs and other trade barriers; the impact of global health pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19;\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and associated adverse operational, contractual and tax consequences.\nAdditionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound, could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nGlobal economic conditions may decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products and harm the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions. These changes in global economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S., may affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. This may result in a decline in sales in the future, increased rate of order cancellations or delays, increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories, longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. There can be no assurance regarding demand for the Company\u2019s products and services in the future.\nDisruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the Company\u2019s access to capital and financial condition.\nFinancial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced times of extreme disruption, including, among other things, sharp increases in the cost of new capital, credit rating downgrades and bailouts, severely\ndiminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money. There can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions. Any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the Company participates may impair the Company\u2019s ability to access its existing cash, utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions, and impair its ability to access sources of new capital. The cost to the Company of any new capital raised and interest expense would increase if this were to occur.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe Company\u2019s financial results are subject to changes in customer demand, which may decrease for a number of reasons, many beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe demand for the Company\u2019s products is dependent upon the size of the markets for its LC, LC-MS,\nthermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry products; the timing and level of capital spending and expenditures of the Company\u2019s customers; changes in governmental regulations, particularly affecting drug, food and drinking water testing; funding available to academic, governmental and research institutions; general economic conditions and the rate of economic growth in the Company\u2019s major markets; and competitive considerations. The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods by customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will effectively forecast customer demand and appropriately allocated research and development expenditures to products with high growth and high margin prospects. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition will not be adversely impacted by a change in any of the factors listed above or the continuation of uncertain global economic conditions.\nAdditionally, the analytical instrument market may, from time to time, experience low sales growth. Approximately 60% and 59% of the Company\u2019s net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were to worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which may be periodically subject to unfavorable market conditions and consolidations. Unfavorable industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nCompetitors may introduce more effective or less expensive products than the Company\u2019s, which could result in decreased sales. The competitive landscape may transform as a result of potential changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidations among the Company\u2019s competitors, which could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe analytical instrument market and, in particular, the portion related to the Company\u2019s HPLC, UPLC, LC-MS,\nthermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines, is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. The Company encounters competition from several international instrument suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. Some competitors have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company\u2019s business, but are typically less focused on the Company\u2019s chosen markets. Over the years, some competitors have merged with other competitors for various reasons, including increasing product line offerings, improving market share and reducing costs. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s competitors will not introduce more effective and less costly products than those of the Company or that the Company will be able to increase its sales and profitability from new product introductions. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s sales and marketing forces will compete successfully against the Company\u2019s competitors in the future.\nStrategies for organic growth require developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate strategy is fundamentally based on winning through organic innovation and deep application expertise. The Company is in the process of developing new products with recently acquired technologies. The future development of these new products will require a significant amount of spending over\nthe next few years before significant, robust sales will be realized. Furthermore, these new products will be sold into both the non-clinical\nand clinical markets, and any new products requiring FDA clearance may take longer to bring to market. There can be no assurance given as to the timing of these new product launches and the ultimate realization of sales and profitability in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s software or hardware may contain coding or manufacturing errors that could impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences.\nDespite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, the detection and correction of any errors in released software or hardware can be time consuming and costly. This could delay the development or release of new products or services, or new versions of products or services, create security vulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s products or services, and adversely affect market acceptance of products or services. If the Company experiences errors or delays in releasing its software or hardware, or new versions thereof, its sales could be affected and revenues could decline. Errors in software or hardware could expose the Company to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as harm to brand and reputation, which could impact future sales.\nDisruption of operations at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities could harm the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company manufactures LC instruments at facilities in Milford, Massachusetts and through a subcontractor in Singapore; precision chemistry separation columns at its facilities in Taunton, Massachusetts and Wexford, Ireland; MS products at its facilities in Wilmslow, England, Solihull, England and Wexford, Ireland; thermal analysis and rheometry products at its facilities in New Castle, Delaware and other instruments and consumables at various other locations as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisitions. Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to adequately protect intellectual property could have materially adverse effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that any patents held by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company. Additionally, there could be successful claims against the Company by third-party patent holders with respect to certain Company products that may infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. The Company\u2019s patents, including those licensed from others, expire on various dates. If the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse and material effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business would suffer if the Company were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply.\nMost of the raw materials, components and supplies purchased by the Company are available from a number of different suppliers; however, a number of items are purchased from limited or single sources of supply and disruption of these sources could have, at a minimum, a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to its relationships with its customers and, accordingly, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s sales would deteriorate if the Company\u2019s outside contractors fail to provide necessary components or modules.\nCertain components or modules of the Company\u2019s LC and MS instruments are manufactured by outside contractors, including the manufacturing of LC instrument systems and related components by contract manufacturing firms in Singapore. Disruptions of service by these outside contractors could have an adverse effect on the supply chain and the financial results of the Company. A prolonged inability to obtain these components or modules could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be harmed by actions of distributors and other third parties that sell our products.\nThe Company sells some products through third parties, including distributors and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks, including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes, credit risks and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue or net earnings. Distributors may also face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable. Violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could materially impact our business. Risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses and weaken our competitive position.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results are subject to unexpected shifts in pre-tax\nincome between tax jurisdictions, changing application of tax law and tax audit examinations.\nThe Company is subject to rates of income tax that range from 0% up to 34% in various jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company typically generates a substantial portion of its income in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Geographical shifts in income from previous quarters\u2019 projections caused by factors including, but not limited to, changes in volume and product mix and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates, could therefore have potentially significant favorable or unfavorable effects on the Company\u2019s income tax expense, effective tax rate and results of operations.\nGovernments in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time. Any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations regarding transfer pricing or repatriation of dividends or capital, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and lead to increases in its overall tax burden, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company entered into a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. Prior to April 1, 2021, the Company had a tax exemption in Singapore on certain types of income, based upon the achievement and continued satisfaction of certain operational and financial milestones, which the Company met as of December 31, 2020 and maintained through March 2021. The Company had determined that it was more likely than not to realize the tax exemption in Singapore and, accordingly, did not recognize any reserves for unrecognized tax benefits on its balance sheet related to this tax exemption. If any of the milestone targets were not met, the Company would not have been entitled to the tax exemption on income earned in Singapore dating back to the start date of the agreement (April 1, 2016), and all the tax benefits previously recognized would be reversed, resulting in the recognition of income tax expense equal to the statutory tax of 17% on income earned during that period.\nAs a global business, the Company is subject to tax audit examinations in various jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company must manage the cost and disruption of responding to governmental audits, investigation and proceedings. In addition, the impact of the settlement of pending or future tax audit examination could have an unfavorable effect on the Company\u2019s income tax expense, effective tax rate and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have\nbeen successful in hiring, our employees. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.\nThe loss of key members of management and the risks inherent in succession planning could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe operation of the Company requires managerial and operational expertise. None of the Company\u2019s key management employees, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have an employment contract with the Company and there can be no assurance that such individuals will remain with the Company. If, for any reason, other key personnel do not continue to be active in management, the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\nDisruption, cyber-attack or unforeseen problems with the security, maintenance or upgrade of the Company\u2019s information and web-based\nsystems could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell products and services, fulfill contract obligations, ship products, collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business. The Company\u2019s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, but not limited to, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access to customer or employee data, unauthorized access to and funds transfers from Company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the Company\u2019s systems. For example, in December 2021, a vulnerability named \u201cLog4Shell\u201d was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j 2. We have reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Additionally, we must maintain and periodically upgrade our information and web-based\nsystems, which has caused and will in the future cause temporary interruptions to our technology infrastructure. Any prolonged disruption to the Company\u2019s technology infrastructure, at any of its facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nIf the Company\u2019s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure, research and development efforts or manufacturing operations, the Company\u2019s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable, the information protected by the Company\u2019s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access, acquisition or modification, the Company\u2019s brand and reputation could be damaged, the services that the Company provides to its customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which could reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings, increase its expenses and expose the Company to legal claims and regulatory actions.\nThe Company is in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science, pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety and environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications, and the Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that support instrument systems. Many of the Company\u2019s customers are in highly regulated industries. While the Company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, products and services, and the internal and external data managed by the Company, there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats. The Company also has acquired companies, products, services and technologies over time and may face inherent risk when integrating these acquisitions into the Company. In addition, at times, the Company faces attempts by third\nparties to defeat its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems. These risks will increase as the Company continues to grow and expand geographically, and its systems, products and services become increasingly digital and sensor- and web-based.\nThe Company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or modification to the Company\u2019s technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, its products and services as well as the internal and external data managed by the Company. Such an incident could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and customers could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services. This could negatively impact sales and could increase costs related to fixing and addressing these incidents and any vulnerabilities exposed by them, as well as to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, claims or legal liability including contractual liability, costs and expenses owed to customers and business partners.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE, REGULATORY OR LEGAL CHANGES\nCompliance failures could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among others, health and safety, import/export, privacy and data protection, FCPA and environmental laws and regulations. A portion of the Company\u2019s operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities, including design, development, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls, the imposition of fines, restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations.\nRegulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations, and the European Union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues. Changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information, such as information related to health, could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the cost of providing the Company\u2019s products or services. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy, data security or consumer protection, or other policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against the Company or levied by governmental entities or others, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances. This requires the Company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations. If the Company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products, it could face civil and/or criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant.\nSome of the Company\u2019s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. The Company must comply with these rules, as well as those of other agencies, such as the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification and/or the imposition of fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nAs a publicly-traded company, the Company is subject to the rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, which require the Company to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s efforts to comply with such laws and regulations are time consuming and costly. While we continue to enhance our controls, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material\nweaknesses. Failure to comply with such regulations or having inadequate internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\nThe Company is subject to the rules of the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company\u2019s products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2020, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2021 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2021 Form SD with the SEC in May 2022. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company\u2019s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products.\nThe Company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the Company from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws, including laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary\npenalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.\nEnvironmental, social and corporate governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies\u2019 ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor, customer, consumer, employee or other stakeholders\u2019 evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship and sustainability, support for local communities, Board of Director and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, supply chain management, corporate governance and transparency, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us.\nCustomers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, energy and water use, plastic waste and other sustainability concerns. Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Changing customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use\nand non-recyclable\nplastic products and packaging, other\ncomponents of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability, or increased customer and consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products. Complying with these demands or requirements could cause us to incur additional manufacturing, operating or product development costs.\nIf we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or fail to meet evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and concerns regarding ESG issues, investors may reconsider their capital investment in our Company, and customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business or financial condition.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nThe effects of climate change could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use and/or levels of possible emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the Company.\nAnother potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions. The Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Germany. In addition, the Company manufactures a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both Singapore and Ireland. Severe weather and geological conditions or events, including earthquakes, hurricanes and/or tsunamis, could potentially cause significant damage to the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries. The effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the Company.\nEstimates and assumptions made in accounting for the Company\u2019s results from operations are dependent on future results, which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. The Company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, warranty and installation provisions, litigation, retirement plan obligations, stock-based compensation, business combinations and asset acquisitions, uncertain tax positions and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the Company\u2019s retirement plans or retirement plan assets.\nThe Company sponsors various retirement plans, both inside and outside the United States. Any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the Company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the Company\u2019s cash flows or results of operations. In connection with these retirement plans, the Company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets. For example, changes in long-term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the Company\u2019s retirement plan\nobligations and related expense. In addition, changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans, and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow.\nThe Company had $1.5 billion in debt and $569 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company also had the ability to borrow an additional $1.6 billion from its existing, committed credit facility. All but a small portion of the Company\u2019s debt was in the U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the United States to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest obligations, finance potential United States acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs. As such, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to generate and maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through (1) cash from operations, (2) the Company\u2019s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility, (3) the ability to expand the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity and (4) other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost.\nDebt covenants, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with them, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s capital and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the Company\u2019s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the Company. These debt covenants include restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements, which may limit the Company\u2019s ability to make dividend or other payments, secure other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. The Company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the Company\u2019s debt agreements. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the Company\u2019s future performance, which is subject to, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.", "PERMNO": 82651, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "WAT"}
