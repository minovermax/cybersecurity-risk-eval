{"cik": "896262", "company": "AMEDISYS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below, and risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only risks faced by Amedisys. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may also be materially adversely affected by factors that are not currently known to us, by factors that we currently consider immaterial or by factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nIf any of the following risks are actually realized, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under \u201cSpecial Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nRisks Related to Reimbursement\nFederal and state changes to reimbursement and other aspects of Medicare and Medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur net service revenue is primarily derived from Medicare, which accounted for 74%, 73% and 76% of our revenue during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Payments received from Medicare are subject to changes made through federal legislation. When such changes are implemented, we must also modify our internal billing processes and procedures accordingly, which can require significant time and expense. These changes, as further detailed in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness: Payment for Our Services,\u201d can include changes to base payments and adjustments for home health services, changes to cap limits and per diem rates for hospice services and changes to Medicare eligibility and documentation requirements or changes designed to restrict utilization. Any such changes, including retroactive adjustments, adopted in the future by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April of 2015, Congress passed and President Obama signed the so-called \u201cdoc fix\u201d in the form of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d). This law replaces a long-standing physician reimbursement formula with statutorily prescribed physician payment updates and provisions. MACRA provided for an increase of 3% of the payment amount\notherwise made for home health services furnished in rural areas and set Medicare reimbursements for post-acute care providers to increase by 1.0% in fiscal year 2018.\nSection 6407 of the Affordable Care Act added new Medicare requirements for face-to-face encounters to support claims for home health services. Under 42 CFR \u00a7 424.22, the certifying physician must document a face-to-face encounter with the patient before making a certification that home health services are required under the Medicare home health benefit. A home health agency\u2019s generated medical record documentation, by itself, is not sufficient in demonstrating the patient's eligibility for the home health benefit. Therefore, additional documentation, such as an admit summary, part of the OASIS, or a therapy evaluation/therapy notes, must be signed off by the certifying physician and incorporated into the medical record to support the face-to-face.\nThe requirements for face-to-face encounters continue to be one of the most complex issues in the industry and can be the source of claims denials if not fulfilled. Section 6407(d) of the Affordable Care Act also provided that the requirements for face-to-face encounters in the provisions described above shall apply in the case of physicians making certifications for home health services under title XIX of the Act (Medicaid) in the same manner and to the same extent as such requirements apply under title XVIII (Medicare). On February 2, 2016, CMS published a final rule, which is currently in effect, adding new requirements for Medicaid home health services. Among other things, the final rule requires that for the initial ordering of home health services, the physician must document that a face-to-face encounter that is related to the primary reason the beneficiary requires home health services occurred no more than 90 days before or 30 days after the start of services. The final rule also requires that for the initial ordering of certain medical equipment, the physician or authorized non-physician practitioner must document that a face-to-face encounter that is related to the primary reason the beneficiary requires medical equipment occurred no more than six months prior to the start of services.\nOn July 31, 2019, CMS issued a final rule to update hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year 2020. The rule includes a rebasing of continuous home care, inpatient respite care and general inpatient care to better reflect the costs of care. This rebasing will be offset by a reduction in routine home care payments of 2.7% to achieve budget neutrality. In addition, CMS eliminated the one-year \u201clag\u201d in the use of the hospital wage index in an effort to align with the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (\"IPPS\") and other payment systems. CMS estimates hospices serving Medicare beneficiaries would see an estimated 2.6% increase in payments. This increase is the result of a 3.0% market basket adjustment less a 0.4% productivity adjustment. We have estimated the impact of the final rule on us to be an increase in revenue of approximately 0.5%; however, we are expecting the impact on gross margin percentage to be a reduction of approximately 0.5% as the majority of the revenue increase will be passed through to the general inpatient and respite facilities. These estimates are subject to change as our mix of work changes.\nIn November 2018, CMS issued the Calendar Year 2019 Home Health Final Rule, which provided for the first payment rate increase for home health providers since 2010. In the 2019 rule, CMS also issued proposed payment changes for Medicare home health providers for 2020. These proposed changes included changes to the Home Health Prospective Payment System (\"HHPPS\") case-mix adjustment methodology through the use of a new Patient-Driven Groupings Model (\"PDGM\") for home health payments, a change in the unit of payment from a 60-day payment period to a 30-day payment period and the elimination of the use of therapy visits in the determination of payments. While the proposed changes are to be implemented in a budget neutral manner to the industry, the ultimate impact will vary by provider based on factors including patient mix and admission source.\nThe CMS Calendar Year 2020 Home Health Final Rule, released in October 2019, sets forth the implementation of PDGM and a change in the unit of payment from 60-day episodes of care to 30-day periods of care. Additionally, in an effort to eliminate fraud risks, CMS is phasing out requests for anticipated payment (\"RAPs\") over 2020 with the full elimination of RAPs in 2021. CMS estimates that the proposed rule will result in a 1.3% increase in payments to home health providers. The increase is the result of a statutorily mandated 1.5% market basket increase pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, reduced by 0.2% for the rural add-on. CMS is also assuming that the industry will make certain behavioral changes resulting in a decrease in reimbursement of 4.36%. We have estimated the impact of the final rule on us to be a reduction in revenue of 2.8%. Our current view is that we can fully offset the impact via behavioral changes and a mix of cost levers which include clinical mix and utilization.\nThere are continuing efforts to reform governmental health care programs that could result in major changes in the health care delivery and reimbursement system on a national and state level, including changes directly impacting the reimbursement systems for our home health and hospice care centers. Though we cannot predict what, if any, reform proposals will be adopted, health care reform and legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows through decreasing payments made for our services.\nWe could be affected adversely by the continuing efforts of governmental payors to contain health care costs. We cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental payor programs, including Medicare supplemental insurance policies, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement\npursuant to these programs. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nQuality reporting requirements may negatively impact Medicare reimbursement.\nHospice quality reporting was mandated by PPACA, which directs the Secretary to establish quality reporting requirements for hospice programs. Failure to submit required quality data will result in a 2 percentage point reduction to the market basket percentage increase for that fiscal year. This quality reporting program is currently \u201cpay-for-reporting,\u201d meaning it is the act of submitting data that determines compliance with program requirements.\nSimilarly, in the Calendar Year 2015 Home Health Final Rule, CMS proposed to establish a new \u201cPay-for-Reporting Performance Requirement\u201d with which provider compliance with quality reporting program requirements can be measured. Home health agencies that do not submit quality measure data to CMS are subject to a 2.0% reduction in their annual home health payment update percentage. Home health agencies are required to report prescribed quality assessment data for a minimum of 70.0% of all patients with episodes of care that occur on or after July 1, 2015. This compliance threshold increased by 10.0% in each of two subsequent periods - i.e., for episodes beginning on or after July 1, 2016 and before June 30, 2017, home health agencies must score at least 80%, and for episodes beginning on or after July 1, 2017 and thereafter, the required performance level is at least 90%.\nThe Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the \u201cIMPACT Act\u201d) requires the submission of standardized data by home health agencies and other providers. Specifically, the IMPACT Act requires, among other significant activities, the reporting of standardized patient assessment data with regard to quality measures, resource use, and other measures. Failure to report data as required will subject providers to a 2% reduction in market basket prices then in effect.\nThere can be no assurance that all of our agencies will continue to meet quality reporting requirements in the future which may result in one or more of our agencies seeing a reduction in its Medicare reimbursements. Regardless, we, like other healthcare providers, are likely to incur additional expenses in an effort to comply with additional and changing quality reporting requirements.\nAny economic downturn, deepening of an economic downturn, continued deficit spending by the Federal Government or state budget pressures may result in a reduction in payments and covered services.\nAdverse developments in the United States could lead to a reduction in Federal Government expenditures, including governmentally funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, if at any time the Federal Government is not able to meet its debt payments unless the federal debt ceiling is raised, and legislation increasing the debt ceiling is not enacted, the Federal Government may stop or delay making payments on its obligations, including funding for government programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Failure of the government to make payments under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, any failure by the United States Congress to complete the federal budget process and fund government operations may result in a Federal Government shutdown, potentially causing us to incur substantial costs without reimbursement under the Medicare program, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As an example, the failure of the 2011 Joint Select Committee to meet its Deficit Reduction goal resulted in an automatic reduction in Medicare home health and hospice payments of 2% beginning April 1, 2013.\nHistorically, state budget pressures have resulted in reductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services.\nIn addition, sustained unfavorable economic conditions may affect the number of patients enrolled in managed care programs and the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced payment rates and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture cost containment initiatives undertaken by private third party payors may limit our future revenue and profitability.\nOur non-Medicare revenue and profitability are affected by continuing efforts of third party payors to maintain or reduce costs of health care by lowering payment rates, narrowing the scope of covered services, increasing case management review of services and negotiating pricing. There can be no assurance that third party payors will make timely payments for our services, and there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain our current payor or revenue mix. We are continuing our efforts to develop our non-Medicare sources of revenue and any changes in payment levels from current or future third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Laws and Government Regulations\nWe are operating under a Corporate Integrity Agreement. Violations of this agreement could result in substantial penalties or exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.\nCorporate Integrity Agreement\nOn April 23, 2014, with no admissions of liability on our part, we entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice relating to certain of our clinical and business operations. Concurrently with our entry into this agreement, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement (\u201cCIA\u201d) with the Office of Inspector General-HHS (\u201cOIG\u201d). The CIA formalized various aspects of our already existing ethics and compliance programs and contained other requirements designed to help ensure our ongoing compliance with federal health care program requirements. Among other things, the CIA required us to maintain our existing compliance program, executive compliance committee and compliance committee of the Board of Directors; provide certain compliance training; continue screening new and current employees to ensure they are eligible to participate in federal health care programs; engage an independent review organization to perform certain audits and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs, our billing submissions to federal health care programs and our compliance and risk mitigation programs; and provide certain reports and management certifications to the OIG. Additionally, the CIA specifically required that we report substantial overpayments that we discovered we had received from federal health care programs, as well as probable violations of federal health care laws. The corporate integrity agreement had a term of five years that ended on April 21, 2019. We filed our final annual report on July 19, 2019.\nCompassionate Care Hospice Corporate Integrity Agreement\nOn January 30, 2015, Compassionate Care Hospice (\u201cCCH\u201d) entered into a CIA with the OIG. The CIA required that CCH provide annual on-site compliance training; develop and implement policies to ensure compliance with federal health care program requirements; screen new and current employees to ensure that they are eligible to participate in federal health care programs; establish a compliance committee that contains both a Compliance Officer and a Chief Quality Officer; retain a Governing Authority expert who will periodically complete a compliance program review; and retain an independent review organization (IRO) to complete claims review for hospice services rendered in New York. The OIG waived the claims review for the final year of the CCH CIA based on the closure of the New York operations. Additionally, the CIA required that CCH report substantial overpayments that CCH discovered it received from federal health care programs, as well as probable violations of federal, criminal, civil or administrative health care laws. Upon breach of the CIA, CCH could have become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties, or could have been excluded from participation in federal health care programs. The CIA has a term of five years that ended on January 30, 2020.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation. Any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business, or to the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur industry is subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cOur Regulatory Environment\u201d for additional information on such laws and regulations. Federal and state laws and regulations impact how we conduct our business, the services we offer and our interactions with patients, our employees and the public and impose certain requirements on us such as:\n\u2022\nlicensure and certification;\n\u2022\nadequacy and quality of health care services;\n\u2022\nqualifications of health care and support personnel;\n\u2022\nquality and safety of medical equipment;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and claims processing;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nemergency preparedness risk assessments and policies and procedures;\n\u2022\npolicies and procedures regarding employee relations;\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services;\n\u2022\nbilling for services;\n\u2022\nrequirements for utilization of services;\n\u2022\ndocumentation required for billing and patient care; and\n\u2022\nreporting and maintaining records regarding adverse events.\nThese laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to change. Changes in existing laws and regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by:\n\u2022\nincreasing our administrative and other costs;\n\u2022\nincreasing or decreasing mandated services;\n\u2022\ncausing us to abandon business opportunities we might have otherwise pursued;\n\u2022\ndecreasing utilization of services;\n\u2022\nforcing us to restructure our relationships with referral sources and providers; or\n\u2022\nrequiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems.\nAdditionally, we are subject to various routine and non-routine reviews, audits and investigations by the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state governmental agencies, which have various rights and remedies against us if they establish that we have overcharged the programs or failed to comply with program requirements. Violation of the laws governing our operations, or changes in interpretations of those laws, could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs and/or the suspension or revocation of our licenses. If we become subject to material fines, or if other sanctions or other corrective actions are imposed on us, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face periodic and routine reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies and private payors, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. We also are subject to audits under various government programs, including the Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201cRACs\u201d), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (\u201cZPICs\u201d), Uniform Program Integrity Contractors (\"UPICs\"), Program Safeguard Contractors (\u201cPSCs\u201d) and Medicaid Integrity Contractors (\u201cMICs\u201d) as well as in accordance with the requirements of our CIA, in which third party firms engaged by CMS or by the Company conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. Private pay sources also reserve the right to conduct audits. If billing errors are identified in the sample of reviewed claims, the billing error can be extrapolated to all claims filed which could result in a larger overpayment than originally identified in the sample of reviewed claims. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews, audits and investigations may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, an adverse review, audit or investigation could result in:\n\u2022\nrequired refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to the federal or state programs or from private payors;\n\u2022\nstate or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in the Medicare program, state programs, or one or more private payor networks; or\n\u2022\ndamage to our business and reputation in various markets.\nThese results could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf a care center fails to comply with the conditions of participation in the Medicare program, that care center could be subjected to sanctions or terminated from the Medicare program.\nEach of our care centers must comply with required conditions of participation in the Medicare program. If we fail to meet the conditions of participation at a care center, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor. If that care center then fails to institute an acceptable plan of correction to remediate the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor, that care center could be terminated from the Medicare program or subjected to alternative sanctions. CMS outlined its alternative sanction enforcement options for home health care centers through a regulation published in 2012; under\nthe regulation, CMS may impose temporary management, direct a plan of correction, direct training or impose payment suspensions and civil monetary penalties, in each case, upon providers who fail to comply with the conditions of participation. Termination of one or more of our care centers from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the program\u2019s conditions of participation, or the imposition of alternative sanctions, could disrupt operations, require significant attention by management, or have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws that govern our financial relationships with physicians and other health care providers, including potential or current referral sources.\nWe are required to comply with federal and state laws, generally referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or other financial arrangements between health care providers that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical services. In addition to these anti-kickback laws, the Federal Government has enacted specific legislation, commonly known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d that prohibits certain financial relationships, specifically including ownership interests and compensation arrangements, between physicians (and the immediate family members of physicians) and providers of designated health services, such as home health care centers, to whom the physicians refer patients. Some of these same financial relationships are also subject to additional regulation by states. Although we believe we have structured our relationships with physicians and other potential referral sources to comply with these laws where applicable, we cannot assure you that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret state and federal anti-kickback laws and/or the Stark Law and similar state laws regulating relationships between health care providers and physicians in ways that will adversely implicate our practices or that isolated instances of noncompliance will not occur. Violations of federal or state Stark or anti-kickback laws could lead to criminal or civil fines or other sanctions, including denials of government program reimbursement or even exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government health care reform.\nThe health care industry in the United States is subject to fundamental changes due to ongoing health care reform efforts and related political, economic and regulatory influences. In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation was signed into law in the United States through the passage of PPACA.\nPPACA makes a number of changes to Medicare payment rates and also calls for a rebasing of the home health payment system. These reimbursement changes are described in detail in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Overview - Payment.\u201d\nRegulations implementing the provisions of the PPACA and related initiatives may similarly increase our costs, decrease our revenues, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business.\nPPACA also calls for a number of other changes to be made over time that will likely have a significant impact upon the health care delivery system. For example, PPACA mandates creation of a home health value-based purchasing program, the development of quality measures and decreases in home health reimbursement rates, including rebasing, as further described in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Overview - Payment.\u201d\nIn addition, various health care reform proposals similar to the federal reforms described above have also emerged at the state level, including in several states in which we operate. We cannot predict with certainty what health care initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal health care reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on us or on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to impacting our Medicare businesses, PPACA may also significantly affect our non-Medicare businesses. PPACA makes many changes to the underwriting and marketing practices of private payors. The resulting economic pressures could prompt these payors to seek to lower their rates of reimbursement for the services we provide. PPACA continues to have residual effects on our non-Medicare business.\nFinally, efforts to repeal or substantially modify provisions of the PPACA continue in Congress and in the courts. The ultimate outcomes of legislative efforts to repeal, substantially amend, eliminate or reduce funding for the PPACA is unknown. In addition to the prospect for legislative repeal or revision, the President and members of his administration hostile to the PPACA could seek to impose substantial changes upon the PPACA through administrative action, including revised regulation and other Executive Branch action. The effect of any major modification or repeal of the PPACA on our business, operations or financial condition cannot be predicted, but could be materially adverse.\nRisks Related to our Growth Strategies\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to acquire additional care centers and integrate and operate these care centers effectively. If our growth strategy is unsuccessful or we are not able to successfully integrate newly acquired care centers into our existing operations, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to fully integrate the operations of our acquired businesses with our current business structure in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in recouping partial episode payments and other types of misdirected payments for services from the previous owners; difficulties integrating acquired personnel and business practices into our business; the potential loss of key employees, referral sources or patients of acquired care centers; the delay in payments associated with change in ownership, control and the internal process of the Medicare fiscal intermediary; and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired care centers. Further, the financial benefits we expect to realize from many of our acquisitions are largely dependent upon our ability to improve clinical performance, overcome regulatory deficiencies, improve the reputation of the acquired business in the community and control costs. The failure to accomplish any of these objectives or to effectively integrate any of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.\nCertain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.\nState efforts to regulate the establishment or expansion of health care providers could impair our ability to expand our operations.\nSome states require health care providers (including skilled nursing facilities, hospice care centers, home health care centers and assisted living facilities) to obtain prior approval, known as a CON or POA, in order to commence operations. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cOur Regulatory Environment\u201d for additional information on CONs and POAs. If we are not able to obtain such approvals, our ability to expand our operations could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal regulation may impair our ability to consummate acquisitions or open new care centers.\nChanges in federal laws or regulations may materially adversely impact our ability to acquire care centers or open new start-up care centers. For example, the Social Security Act provides the Secretary with the authority to impose temporary moratoria on the enrollment of new Medicare providers, if deemed necessary to combat fraud, waste or abuse under government programs. While there are no active Medicare moratoria, there can be no assurance that CMS will not adopt a moratorium on new providers in the future. Additionally, in 2010, CMS implemented and amended a regulation known as the \u201c36 Month Rule\u201d that is applicable to home health care center acquisitions. Subject to certain exceptions, the 36 Month Rule prohibits buyers of certain home health care centers - those that either enrolled in Medicare or underwent a change in majority ownership fewer than 36 months prior to the acquisition - from assuming the Medicare billing privileges of the acquired care center. The 36 Month Rule may restrict bona fide transactions and potentially block new investments in home health agencies. These changes in federal laws and regulations, and similar future changes, may further increase competition for acquisition targets and could have a material detrimental impact on our acquisition strategy.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nBecause we are limited in our ability to control rates received for our services, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or reduce our costs to provide such services.\nAs Medicare is our primary payor and rates are established through federal legislation, we have to manage our costs of providing care to achieve a desired level of profitability. Additionally, non-Medicare rates are difficult for us to negotiate as such payors are under pressure to reduce their own costs. As a result, we manage our costs in order to achieve a desired level of profitability including, but not limited to, centralization of various processes, the use of technology and management of the number of employees\nutilized. If we are not able to continue to streamline our processes and reduce our costs, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is highly competitive, with few barriers to entry in certain states.\nThere are few barriers to entry in home health markets that do not require a CON or POA. Our primary competition comes from local privately-owned and hospital-owned health care providers. We compete based on the availability of personnel; the quality of services; expertise of visiting staff; and in certain instances, on the price of our services. Increased competition in the future may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share.\nFurther, the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings by others, in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors (including mergers of competitors with each other and with insurers), could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or make our services less attractive. Additionally, we compete with a number of non-profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us.\nManaged care organizations and other third party payors continue to consolidate, which enhances their ability to influence the delivery of health care services. Consequently, the health care needs of patients in the United States are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations. These organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if these organizations terminate us as a provider and/or engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider. In addition, should private payors, including managed care payors, seek to negotiate additional discounted fee structures or the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to react competitively to new developments, our operating results may suffer. State CON or POA laws often limit the ability of competitors to enter into a given market, are not uniform throughout the United States and are frequently the subject of efforts to limit or repeal such laws. If states remove existing CONs or POAs, we could face increased competition in these states. For example, New Hampshire repealed its CON laws in 2015, and legislation was recently introduced in South Carolina that would have limited the application of its CON program. There can be no assurances that other states will not seek to eliminate or limit their existing CON or POA programs, which could lead to increased competition in these states. Further, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on referrals from physicians, hospitals and other sources in the communities we serve and on our ability to maintain good relationships with existing referral sources. Our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers. Our growth and profitability depend, in part, on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home health and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new referral relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to provide consistently high quality of care, our business will be adversely impacted.\nProviding quality patient care is the cornerstone of our business. We believe that hospitals, physicians and other referral sources refer patients to us in large part because of our reputation for delivering quality care. Clinical quality is becoming increasingly important within our industry. Effective October 2012, Medicare began to impose a financial penalty upon hospitals that have excessive rates of patient readmissions within 30 days from hospital discharge. We believe this regulation provides a competitive advantage to home health providers who can differentiate themselves based upon quality, particularly by achieving low patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates and by implementing disease management programs designed to be responsive to the needs of patients served by referring hospitals. We are focused intently upon improving our patient outcomes, particularly our patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates. If we should fail to attain our goals regarding acute care hospitalization readmission rates and other quality metrics, we expect our ability to generate referrals would be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, Medicare has established consumer-facing websites, Home Health Compare and Hospice Compare, that present data regarding our performance on certain quality measures compared to state and national averages. If we should fail to achieve or exceed these averages, it may affect our ability to generate referrals, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our information systems. A cyber-attack, security breach or our inability to effectively integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure and operational could disrupt our operations.\nOur business depends on effective, secure and operational information systems which include systems provided by external contractors and other service providers. For example, our care centers depend upon our information systems for patient care, accounting, billing, collections, risk management, quality assurance, human resources, payroll and other information. Our networks and devices store sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients, partners, and employees.\nIn general, our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, human acts, break-ins and similar events. Our business is at risk from and may be impacted by information security incidents, including ransomware, malware, phishing, social engineering, and other security events. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. These events can also result from internal compromises, such as human error or malicious acts. These events can occur on our systems or on the systems of our partners and subcontractors.\nProblems with, or the failure of, our technology and systems or any system upgrades or programming changes associated with such technology and systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations, patient care, data capture, medical documentation, billing, collections, assessment of internal controls and management and reporting capabilities. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be materially adversely affected. If we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could result in harm to patients; business interruptions and delays; the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; reputational damage and federal and state governmental inquiries. Any such problems or failures and the costs incurred in correcting any such problems or failures, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, to the extent our external information technology contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems we have licensed from them, our operations could be materially adversely affected. A failure to restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, loss of electronically stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action and litigation and possible liability and loss.\nOur information systems and applications also require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs. Our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems. We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems\u2019 capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to mitigate and alleviate problems caused by breaches, including unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information stored in our information systems, and the introduction of computer viruses or other malicious software programs to our systems. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations could be materially adversely affected by federal and state fines and penalties, legal claims or proceedings, cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented. The healthcare industry is currently experiencing increased attention on compliance with regulations designed to safeguard protected health information and mitigate cyber-attacks on entities. There are significant costs associated with a breach, including investigation costs, remediation and mitigation costs, notification costs, attorney fees, and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to a loss in confidence in the provider. We cannot predict the costs to comply with these laws or the costs associated with a potential breach of protected health information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our business reputation.\nWe have installed privacy protection systems and devices on our network and point of care tablets in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to information in our database. However, our technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential health\ninformation and personally identifiable information we maintain in our databases. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our patients and regulators, which could result in fines, litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are not held liable, any resulting negative publicity could harm our business and distract the attention of management.\nWe believe that our subcontractors and vendors take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our business operations as a result of failure or disruption to their information systems. However, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a disruption, and it is possible that we may be impacted by information system failures. The occurrence of any information system failures could result in interruptions, delays, loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems. All of these events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and they could harm our business reputation.\nWe believe we have all the necessary licenses from third parties to use technology and software that we do not own. A third party could, however, allege that we are infringing its rights, which may deter our ability to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms from the third party, if at all, or cause the third party to commence litigation against us. In addition, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the scope and validity of any proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation, or the failure to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nPossible changes in the case mix of patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revenue is determined by a number of factors, including our mix of patients and the rates of payment among payors. Changes in the case mix of our patients, payment methodologies or the payor mix among Medicare, Medicaid and private payors could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to negotiate favorable managed care contracts, or our loss of existing favorable managed care contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOne of our strategies is to diversify our payor sources by increasing the business we do with managed care companies, and we strive to put in place favorable contracts with managed care payors. However, we may not be successful in these efforts. Additionally, there is a risk that the favorable managed care contracts that we put in place may be terminated. Managed care contracts typically permit the payor to terminate the contract without cause, on very short notice, typically 60 days, which can provide payors leverage to reduce volume or obtain favorable pricing. Our failure to negotiate and put in place favorable managed care contracts, or our failure to maintain in place favorable managed care contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA write off of a significant amount of intangible assets or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis under Accounting Standard Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 350 \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d in future periods in addition to our annual impairment test. If we were to conclude that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then we would record the appropriate charge, which could result in material charges that are adverse to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Part II, Item 8, Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill was approximately $658.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and if we make additional acquisitions, it is likely that we will record additional goodwill and intangible assets in our consolidated financial statements. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets of $92.9 million as of December 31, 2019, which we review on a periodic basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination that a significant impairment in value of our unamortized intangible assets or long-lived assets occurs, such determination could require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets. A write off of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nA shortage of qualified registered nursing staff and other clinicians, such as therapists and nurse practitioners, could materially impact our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs.\nWe compete for qualified personnel with other healthcare providers. Our ability to attract and retain clinicians depends on several factors, including our ability to provide these personnel with attractive assignments and competitive salaries and benefits. We cannot be assured we will succeed in any of these areas. In addition, there are shortages of qualified health care personnel in some of our markets. As a result, we may face higher costs of attracting clinicians and providing them with attractive benefit packages than we originally anticipated which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if we expand our operations into geographic areas where health care providers historically have been unionized, or if any of our care center employees become unionized, being subject to a collective bargaining agreement may have a negative impact on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and may increase our operating costs. Generally, if we are unable to attract and retain clinicians, the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs.\nAs a result of operating in the home health industry, our business entails an inherent risk of claims, losses and potential lawsuits alleging incidents involving our employees that are likely to occur in a patient\u2019s home. We maintain professional liability insurance to provide coverage to us and our subsidiaries against these risks. However, we cannot assure you claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of our insurance, nor can we assure you that any such claims, if successful and in excess of such limits, will not have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our insurance coverage also includes fire, property damage and general liability with varying limits. We cannot assure you that the insurance we maintain will satisfy claims made against us or that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms. Any claims made against us, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, could damage our reputation and business.\nWe may be subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims.\nThe services we offer involve an inherent risk of professional liability and related substantial damage awards. As of February 14, 2020, we have approximately 21,300 employees (11,600 home health, 5,800 hospice, 3,000 personal care and 900 corporate employees). In addition, we employ direct care workers on a contractual basis to support our existing workforce. Due to the nature of our business, we, through our employees and caregivers who provide services on our behalf, may be the subject of medical malpractice claims. A court could find these individuals should be considered our agents, and, as a result, we could be held liable for their acts or omissions. We cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. While we maintain malpractice liability coverage that we believe is appropriate given the nature and breadth of our operations, any claims against us in excess of insurance limits, or multiple claims requiring us to pay deductibles, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain our corporate reputation, including our reputation for providing quality patient care and for compliance with Medicare requirements and the other laws to which we are subject. Adverse publicity surrounding any aspect of our business, including the death or disability of any of our patients due to our failure to provide proper care, or due to any failure on our part to comply with Medicare requirements or other laws to which we are subject, could negatively affect our Company\u2019s overall reputation and the willingness of referral sources to refer patients to us.\nWe depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees.\nWe depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage our operations. The loss or departure of any one of these executives or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations could be impacted by natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could not only impact the day-to-day operations of our care centers, but could also disrupt our relationships with patients, employees and referral sources located in the affected areas and, in the case of our corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection services. In addition, any episode of care that is not completed due to the impact of a natural disaster will generally result in lower revenue for the episode. For example, our corporate office and a number of our care centers are located in the southeastern United States and the Gulf Coast Region, increasing our exposure to hurricanes and flooding. Future hurricanes or other natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nDelays in payment may cause liquidity problems.\nOur business is characterized by delays from the time we provide services to the time we receive payment for these services. If we have difficulty in obtaining documentation, such as physician orders, experience information system problems or experience other issues that arise with Medicare or other payors, we may encounter additional delays in our payment cycle.\nIn addition, timing delays in billings and collections may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, Medicare or other provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk. CMS's inability to have its systems ready to properly reimburse home health providers under the new PDGM could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn May 31, 2018, CMS issued a notice indicating its intention to re-launch a home health agency (\"HHA\") pre-claim review demonstration project. Now called the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services, the revised demonstration will give HHAs in the demonstration states 3 options: pre-claim review of all claims, post-payment review of all claims, or minimal post-payment review with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services. The demonstration initially will apply to HHA providers in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas, with the option to expand after 5 years to other states in the Medicare Administrative Contractor Jurisdiction M (Palmetto). In an October 21, 2019 release, CMS announced that it will reschedule the next phase of its RCD to allow agencies time to transition to PDGM. RCD implementation will resume on March 2, 2020 in Texas, followed by demonstrations in North Carolina and Florida on May 4, 2020. However, CMS officials have indicated that these dates are subject to change. Following the start of the demonstration in Texas, the demonstration is expected to begin in North Carolina and Florida on May 4, 2020. CMS will monitor the transition to the PDGM and assess the need for any change to this date.\nAdditionally, our hospice operations may experience payment delays. We have experienced payment delays when attempting to collect funds from state Medicaid programs in certain instances. Delays in receiving payments from these programs may also materially adversely affect our working capital.\nChanges in units of payment for home health agencies could reduce our Medicare home health reimbursement levels.\nAs required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the PDGM will change the unit of payment for home health agencies from a 60-day episode of care to 30-day periods of care. This change is proposed to be implemented in a budget neutral manner. Thus, the move to the PDGM is not supposed to result in lower net reimbursement. However, CMS has made assumptions about behavioral changes; for example, that home health agencies will change their documentation and coding practices and would put the highest paying diagnosis code as the principal diagnosis code in order to have a 30-day period be placed into a higher-paying clinical group. CMS has taken into account expected behavioral effects of policy changes related to implementation of the PDGM, resulting in lower reimbursement levels in some cases. Accordingly, the implementation of the PDGM could negatively impact our 2020 rate of reimbursement and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cOur Regulatory Environment - Home Health Payment Reform\u201d for additional information on the PDGM.\nThe volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the United States and global economies could impact our ability to access both available and affordable financing, and without such financing, we may be unable to achieve our objectives for strategic acquisitions and internal growth.\nWhile we intend to finance strategic acquisitions and internal growth with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, we may require sources of capital in addition to those presently available to us. Uncertainty in the capital and credit markets may impact our ability to access capital on terms acceptable to us (i.e. at attractive/affordable rates) or at all, and this may result in our inability to achieve present objectives for strategic acquisitions and internal growth. Further, in the event we need additional funds, and we are unable to raise the necessary funds on acceptable terms, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness could impact our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill other obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $242.3 million. Our level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could impair our ability to fulfill other obligations in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nit could require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions, start-ups, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nit could limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other purposes;\n\u2022\nit could limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our industry or business;\n\u2022\nit could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic or business conditions; and\n\u2022\nit could limit our ability to make acquisitions or take advantage of other business opportunities.\nIn the event we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and our failure to satisfy requirements in these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness (the \u201cDebt Agreements\u201d) contain certain obligations, including restrictive covenants that require us to comply with or maintain certain financial covenants and ratios and restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase stock, pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into joint ventures;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u2022\ninvest in foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\namend acquisition documents;\n\u2022\nenter into certain swap agreements;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments;\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or leaseback assets; and\n\u2022\nmake fundamental changes in our corporate existence and principal business.\nOur Debt Agreements also limit our ability to reinvest the net cash proceeds from asset sales or subordinated debt issuances in certain circumstances. For example, in the event we or any of our subsidiaries receive more than $5 million in net cash proceeds from an asset sale, disposition or involuntary disposition, our Debt Agreements require us to prepay our term loan facility and revolving credit facility with all of such net cash proceeds, unless we elect to reinvest the net cash proceeds in fixed or capital assets related to our business.\nIn addition, events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the Debt Agreements. Any failure by us to comply with or maintain all applicable financial covenants and ratios and to comply with all other applicable covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the Debt Agreements. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders in the event of any non-compliance, our lenders could accelerate the maturity of any outstanding indebtedness and terminate the commitments to make further extensions of credit (including our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility). Any failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe potential cessation or modification of LIBOR may increase our interest expense or otherwise adversely affect us.\nOur credit facility carries a floating interest rate which is tied to the Eurodollar rate (i.e., LIBOR) and the prime rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for LIBOR reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. Although our credit facility provides for alternative base rates, some of those alternative base rates are related to LIBOR, and the consequences of any potential cessation, modification or other reform of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we most likely will need to amend the credit facility, and we cannot predict what alternative interest rate(s) will be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest expense may increase, our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness may be impacted and our available cash flow may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that impact the market prices of securities, particularly those of health care companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance;\n\u2022\nvariances in our quarterly financial results compared to research analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture purchases or sales of common stock by the Company or large stockholders or the perception that such purchases or sales could occur;\n\u2022\ninvestor, analyst and media perception of our business and our prospects;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance payment rates for home health and hospice;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; or\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) in particular, has experienced price and volume fluctuations that we believe have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of health care provider companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock,\nregardless of our operating performance. Securities class-action cases have often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities.\nThe activities of short sellers could reduce the price or prevent increases in the price of our common stock. \u201cShort sale\u201d is defined as the sale of stock by an investor that the investor does not own. Typically, investors who sell short believe the price of the stock will fall, and anticipate selling shares at a higher price than the purchase price at which they will buy the stock. As of December 31, 2019, investors held a short position of approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock which represented 4% of our outstanding common stock. The anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur Board of Directors may use anti-takeover provisions or issue stock to discourage a change of control.\nOur certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 60,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock. Our Board of Directors may cause us to issue additional stock to discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company. For example, shares of stock could be sold to purchasers who might support our Board of Directors in a control contest or to dilute the voting or other rights of a person seeking to obtain control. In addition, our Board of Directors could cause us to issue preferred stock entitling holders to vote separately on any proposed transaction, convert preferred stock into common stock, demand redemption at a specified price in connection with a change in control, or exercise other rights designed to impede a takeover.\nThe issuance of additional shares may, among other things, dilute the earnings and equity per share of our common stock and the voting rights of common stockholders.\nWe have implemented other anti-takeover provisions or provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals, no cumulative voting for directors, director vacancies are filled by remaining directors (including vacancies resulting from removal), and the number of directors is fixed by the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors can increase or decrease the size of the Board of Directors without stockholder approval (within the range set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws). These provisions, and others that our Board of Directors may adopt hereafter, may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our Board of Directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us, even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock. Therefore, our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control.", "PERMNO": 80795, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "AMED"}
