{"cik": "1309082", "company": "CAMBER ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business and operations are subject to many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the financial statements and the related notes. Please read \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this filing, where we describe additional uncertainties associated with our business and the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this filing.\nOur securities should only be purchased by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment in us. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this filing before deciding to become a holder of our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be negatively affected to a significant extent.\nLineal owes us a substantial amount of money which may not be timely repaid, if at all.\nPursuant to a December 31, 2019 Redemption Agreement entered into between us and the prior owners of Lineal, we entered into a new unsecured promissory note in the amount of $1,539,719 with Lineal, evidencing the outstanding amount of a prior July 2019 promissory note, together with additional amounts loaned by us to Lineal through December 31, 2019 (the \u201cDecember 2019 Lineal Note\u201d); and loaned Lineal an additional $800,000, which was evidenced by an unsecured promissory note in the amount of $800,000, entered into by Lineal in favor of Camber on December 31, 2019 (\u201cLineal Note No. 2\u201d). The December 2019 Lineal Note and Lineal Note No. 2, accrue interest, payable quarterly in arrears, beginning on March 31, 2020 and continuing until December 31, 2021, when all interest and principal is due, at 8% and 10% per annum (18% upon the occurrence of an event of default), respectively. The December 2019 Lineal Note and Lineal Note No. 2 are unsecured. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on its operations, Lineal notified the Company that it currently has insufficient liquidity to make scheduled interest payments due under the notes. As of December 31, 2021, Lineal is in arrears for interest due since July 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has fully reserved the note receivable and all accrued, but unpaid interest in its allowance for bad debts.\nOur Business and operations may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks.\nAs a result of the recent COVID-19 outbreak or other adverse public health developments, including voluntary and mandatory quarantines, travel restrictions and other restrictions, our operations, and those of our subcontractors, customers and suppliers, have and may continue to experience delays or disruptions and temporary suspensions of operations. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe timeline and potential magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak is currently unknown. The continuation or amplification of this virus could continue to more broadly affect the United States and global economy, including our business and operations, and the demand for oil and gas (as it has already). For example, a significant outbreak of coronavirus or other contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our operating results. In addition, the effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding its global spread have recently negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which has contributed to price volatility, impacted the price we receive for oil and natural gas and materially and adversely affected the demand for and marketability of our production. As the potential impact from COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results or the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. Any impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results.\nFurthermore, COVID-19 and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand and prices for crude oil and NGLs. If the COVID-19 outbreak should continue or worsen, we may also experience disruptions to commodities markets, equipment supply chains and the availability of personnel, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations. There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic - including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the extent of travel restrictions and business closures imposed in affected countries - to fully assess the potential impact on our business and operations.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plans, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. If we expand our activities, developments and production, and increases in the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the inability to recruit and retain experienced managers, geoscientists, petroleum engineers, landmen, engineers and employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nWe depend significantly upon the continued involvement of our present management.\nWe depend to a significant degree upon the involvement of our management, specifically, our Chief Executive Officer, James G. Doris, and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Barker, who were appointed on December 23, 2020 concurrent with the Acquisition. Mr. Doris is in charge of our strategic planning and operations. Our performance and success are dependent to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Doris and Mr. Barker. We do not believe that Mr. Doris or Mr. Barker could be quickly replaced with personnel of equal experience and capabilities, and their successor(s) may not be as effective. If Mr. Doris, Mr. Barker, or any of our other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe also have an active Board of Directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately involved in its business and the determination of our operational strategies. Members of our Board of Directors work closely with management to identify potential prospects, acquisitions and areas for further development. If any of our directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, our operations may be adversely affected.\nFuture increases in our tax obligations; either due to increases in taxes on energy products, energy service companies and exploration activities or reductions in currently available federal income tax deductions with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, may adversely affect our results of operations and increase our operating expenses.\nFederal, state and local governments have jurisdiction in areas where we operate and impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell. There are constant discussions by federal, state and local officials concerning a variety of energy tax proposals, some of which, if passed, would add or increase taxes on energy products, service companies and exploration activities. The passage of any legislation or any other changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could impact or increase the taxes that we are required to pay and consequently adversely affect our results of operations and/or increase our operating expenses.\nBecause of the inherent dangers involved in oil and gas exploration, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages for our conduct or our business operations, which could force us to expend a substantial amount of money in connection with litigation and/or a settlement.\nThe oil and natural gas business involve a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property purchased and leased by us in the future. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for the purchase of properties and/or property interests, exploration, development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties and/or force us to expend substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements. As such, our current insurance or the insurance that we may obtain in the future may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot predict the availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. We may elect to self-insure if management believes that the cost of insurance, although available, is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, which could lead to any investment in us declining in value or becoming worthless.\nWe incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.\nOur operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and natural gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSpecifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) EPA rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPA\u2019s rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, we are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers to reduce GHG emissions.\nAdditionally, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level, including possible regulations limiting the ability to dispose of produced waters. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements (such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process) and in additional operating restrictions. In addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells, testing of nearby water wells, restrictions on the access to and usage of water and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.\nWe will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPossible regulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and gas.\nStudies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have begun adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or have begun considering adopting greenhouse gas regulatory programs. At the federal level, Congress has considered legislation that could establish a cap-and-trade system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The ultimate outcome of this federal legislative initiative remains uncertain. In addition to pending climate legislation, the EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an \u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as a first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. Moreover, the EPA has begun regulating greenhouse gas emission from certain facilities pursuant to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the Clean Air Act. In the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by government entities and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property. Any existing or future laws or regulations that restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating and compliance costs. In addition, such laws and regulations may adversely affect demand for the fossil fuels we produce, including by increasing the cost of combusting fossil fuels and by creating incentives for the use of alternative fuels and energy.\nOur officers and directors have limited liability, and we are required in certain instances to indemnify our officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duties.\nWe have adopted provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws which limit the liability of our officers and directors and provide for indemnification by us of our officers and directors to the full extent permitted by Nevada corporate law. Our articles generally provide that our officers and directors shall have no personal liability to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors, except for breaches of their duties of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, acts involving unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or any transaction from which a director derives an improper personal benefit. Such provisions substantially limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to hold officers and directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty, and may require us to indemnify our officers and directors.\nWe currently have outstanding indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations in the future.\nWe currently have outstanding indebtedness and, in the future, may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u00b7\na significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\na high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nany covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u00b7\ndispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u00b7\na high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, they may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u00b7\ndebt covenants to which we may agree may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in its industry.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations.\nOur implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. As reported under \u201cPart II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d, as of December 31, 2021, our CEO and CFO have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, and such disclosure controls and procedures have not been deemed effective since approximately September 30, 2017. Separately, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 and determined that such internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of such assessment.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.\nMaintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements and the Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses in such controls as promptly as possible. However, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock, and/or result in litigation against us or our management. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements or our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nRisks Relating to Our Oil and Gas Operations and Industry\nWe are subject to production declines and loss of revenue due to shut-in wells.\nThe majority of our oil and gas production revenues come from a number of producing wells. In the event those wells are required to be shut-in (as they were for various periods in the past), our production and revenue could be adversely affected. Our wells are shut-in from time-to-time for maintenance, workovers, upgrades and other matters outside of our control, including repairs, adverse weather (including hurricanes, flooding and tropical storms), inability to dispose of produced water or other regulatory and market conditions. Any significant period where our wells, and especially our top producing wells, are shut-in, would have a material adverse effect on our results of production, oil and gas revenues and net income or loss for the applicable period. However, notwithstanding the above, Camber\u2019s management believes that Camber\u2019s non-operated properties will be immaterial to the combined company following the merger and following the merger the combined company\u2019s management will determine what course to take regarding such combined company assets, including Camber\u2019s non-operated properties.\nMany of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells.\nMany of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset drilling. Interference from offset drilling may inhibit our ability to find or recover commercial quantities of oil and/or may result in an acceleration in the decline in production of our wells, which may in turn have an adverse effect on our recovered barrels of oil and consequently our results of operations.\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile in general and low prices will negatively affect our financial results.\nOur oil and gas revenues, operating results, profitability, cash flow, future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital, as well as the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties, are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been very volatile, and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nseasonal variations in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nprice and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u00b7\nconsumer demand;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nvariations in levels of production;\n\u00b7\nregional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas; price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nglobal pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19;\n\u00b7\nthe completion of large domestic or international exploration and production projects;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on exportation of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of refining capacity;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia; and\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations, actions and taxes.\nFurther, oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Our revenue, profitability, and cash flow depend upon the prices of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, declines in commodity prices may:\n\u00b7\nnegatively impact the value of our reserves, because declines in oil and natural gas prices would reduce the value and amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u00b7\nreduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness, and other corporate purposes; and\n\u00b7\nlimit Camber\u2019s ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.\nDownturns and volatility in global economies and commodity and credit markets have materially adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially adversely affected by the conditions of the global economies and the credit, commodities and stock markets. Among other things, we have recently been adversely impacted, and anticipate to continue to be adversely impacted, due to a global reduction in consumer demand for oil and gas, and consumer lack of access to sufficient capital to continue to operate their businesses or to operate them at prior levels. In addition, a decline in consumer confidence or changing patterns in the availability and use of disposable income by consumers can negatively affect the demand for oil and gas and as a result our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in connection with our oil and gas operations.\nWe are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies, drilling and income programs and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas and Oklahoma. Many competitors are large, well-known energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry. Management believes that a viable marketplace exists for smaller producers of natural gas and crude oil.\nOur oil and gas competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively.\nThe oil and gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Specifically, applicable laws protecting endangered species prohibit the harming of endangered or threatened species, provide for habitat protection, and impose stringent penalties for noncompliance. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nIf we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices, we may be subject to significant reductions in prices. Alternatively, we use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts, which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our profitability.\nIn the event that we choose not to hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices by purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies, we may be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability. Alternatively, we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nDeclines in oil and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices, have in the past, and will continue in the future to, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations may adversely affect our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations or targets and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, access to capital, present value and quality of reserves, the nature and scale of our operations and future rate of growth. Oil, NGL and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. In recent years, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. In general, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. The price of crude oil has experienced significant volatility over the last five years, with the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude rising from a low of $27 in February 2016 to a high of $76 in October 2018, then, in 2020, dropping below $20 per barrel due in part to reduced global demand stemming from the recent global COVID-19 outbreak, provided that pricing has since increased to over $100 per barrel prior to the filing of this Report. A prolonged period of low market prices for oil and natural gas, or further declines in the market prices for oil and natural gas, will likely result in capital expenditures being further curtailed and will adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity and our ability to meet obligations, targets or financial commitments and could ultimately lead to restructuring or filing for bankruptcy, which would have a material adverse effect on our stock price and indebtedness.\nOur oil and gas operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking processes. Our oil and gas operations and future operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may be limited. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and conditions could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands. Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters has, and will continue to, complicate and increase the cost of obtaining such permits or other approvals. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations, and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General permits issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. There has been recent nationwide concern over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. It is likely that new rules and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others. Finally, EPA studies have previously focused on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It is possible that, in the future, the EPA will move to more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our business, financial condition, and operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal or recycling of water will increase our operating costs and may cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In addition, our inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion operations may impact our business, and any such future laws and regulations could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties in the future, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, and may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. We may be unable to locate or make suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and future acquisitions may not be effectively and profitably integrated. Acquisitions involve risks that could divert management resources and/or result in the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired operations. For the reasons above, among others, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.\nIf we make any acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we make acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, funding permitting, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies\u2019 assets, personnel and operations with our own. Additionally, acquisitions, mergers or business combinations we may enter into in the future (other than the Merger) could result in a change of control of the Company, and a change in the Board of Directors or officers of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired companies, concepts and operations;\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u00b7\nchange in our business focus and/or management;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7\nthe potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully manage the companies and/or concepts acquired;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or\n\u00b7\nthe effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny acquisition or business combination transaction we enter into in the future could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders, result in one party having majority or significant control over the Company or result in a change in business focus of the Company.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation.\nAs many of our activities are subject to federal, state and local regulation, and as these rules are subject to constant change or amendment, our operations may be adversely affected by new or different government regulations, laws or court decisions applicable to our operations.\nGovernment regulation and liability for environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCrude oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, which may be changed from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil and natural gas. There are federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment applicable to the development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of crude oil and natural gas, byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with crude oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may inherit liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe crude oil and natural gas reserves we report in our SEC filings are estimates and may prove to be inaccurate.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values. The reserves we report in our filings with the SEC now and in the future will only be estimates and such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of these uncertainties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves depend upon a number of variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas and assumptions concerning effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial costs. Some or all of these assumptions may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustment. Actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and such variances may be material.\nAdditionally, \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cpossible reserve estimates\u201d are considered unproved reserves and as such, the SEC views such estimates to be inherently unreliable, may be misunderstood or seen as misleading to investors that are not \u201cexperts\u201d in the oil or natural gas industry. Unless you have such expertise, you should not place undue reliance on these estimates. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update this information and do not intend to update this information.\nThe calculated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows as included in our public filings is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on current costs held constant over time without escalation and on commodity prices using an unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month index prices, appropriately adjusted, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used for these estimates and will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nactual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nCrude oil and natural gas development, re-completion of wells from one reservoir to another reservoir, restoring wells to production and exploration, drilling and completing new wells are speculative activities and involve numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs.\nOur oil and gas operations will be materially dependent upon the success of our future development program. Even considering our business philosophy to avoid wildcat wells, drilling for crude oil and natural gas and reworking existing wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive crude oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of exploration, drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inability to obtain leases on economic terms, where applicable; adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment. Furthermore, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to obtain rights to additional producing properties in the future and/or that any properties we obtain rights to will contain commercially exploitable quantities of oil and/or gas.\nDrilling or reworking is a highly speculative activity. Even when fully and correctly utilized, modern well completion techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling do not guarantee that we will find crude oil and/or natural gas in our wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid with or without particulates into a formation at high pressure, thereby creating fractures in the rock and leaving the particulates in the fractures to ensure that the fractures remain open, thereby potentially increasing the ability of the reservoir to produce oil or natural gas. Horizontal drilling involves drilling horizontally out from an existing vertical well bore, thereby potentially increasing the area and reach of the well bore that is in contact with the reservoir. Our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate and/or our drilling success rate for activities within a particular geographic area may decline in the future. We may identify and develop prospects through a number of methods, some of which do not include lateral drilling or hydraulic fracturing, and some of which may be unproven. The drilling and results for these prospects may be particularly uncertain. Our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted prospects will be dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the results of previous development efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of data; the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants, if any, for the drilling of the prospects; the approval of the prospects by other participants, if any, after additional data has been compiled; economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for crude oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews; our financial resources and results; the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects; and the success of our drilling technology.\nThese projects may not be successfully developed and the wells discussed, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive crude oil or natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to find commercially exploitable quantities of oil and natural gas in any properties we may acquire in the future, and/or we are unable to commercially extract such quantities we may find in any properties we may acquire in the future, the value of our securities may decline in value.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on properties owned by us or by other persons or entities and (b) economically finding or acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties. During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies and personnel, including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel, could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our operations. When drilling activity in the United States increases, associated costs typically also increase, including those costs related to drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. These costs may increase, and necessary equipment and services may become unavailable to us at economical prices. Should this increase in costs occur, we may delay drilling activities, which may limit our ability to establish and replace reserves, or we may incur these higher costs, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies tend to increase, in some cases substantially. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases within a geographic area. If increasing levels of exploration and production result in response to strong prices of oil and natural gas, the demand for oilfield services will likely rise, and the costs of these services will likely increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. The future lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, as well as any future lack of availability or high costs of other equipment, supplies, insurance or qualified personnel, in the areas in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the transportation and use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of waters, and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater, air quality and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. Additional legislation or regulation could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing, cause operational delays, increase our operating costs or make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. New legislation or regulations in the future could have the effect of prohibiting the use of hydraulic fracturing, which would prevent us from completing our wells as planned and would have a material adverse effect on production from our wells. If these legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material delay or decrease in our drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities, our business and profitability could be materially impacted.\nFuture acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.\nSuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well, we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise. There may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. At times, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. In addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.\nRisks Relating To An Investment In Our Securities\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American equities market, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. The NYSE American will consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that does not meet its continued listing standards. If we cannot meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements, the NYSE American may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock.\nOn February 24, 2020, we received notice from the NYSE American (the \u201cExchange\u201d) that we were not in compliance with certain of the Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards as set forth in Part 10 of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d). Specifically, because we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years then ended, we did not comply with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide because we had stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $4,000,000 and reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years. In order to maintain our listing on the Exchange, the Exchange requested we submit a plan of compliance (the \u201cPlan\u201d) by March 25, 2020 addressing how we intended to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide by August 24, 2021, which plan was submitted and accepted. On May 8, 2020, the Company was notified by the NYSE that the NYSE Regulation accepted the Company\u2019s plan to regain compliance with the Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) by August 24, 2021, subject to periodic review by the NYSE for compliance with the initiatives set forth in the plan. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by August 24, 2021, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, the NYSE staff may initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. We are continuing to make progress with our plan of compliance as previously submitted to the NYSE. During the plan period, we are able to continue our listing and will be subject to continued periodic review by the Exchange staff. If we do not make progress consistent with the Plan during the plan period, we will be subject to delisting procedures as set forth in the Company Guide. Pursuant to a letter dated January 21, 2021, the Exchange advised the Company is back in compliance with all of the Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards set forth in Company Guide. Specifically, the Company has resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide referenced in the Exchange\u2019s letter dated February 24, 2020. The Company is subject to NYSE Regulation\u2019s normal continued listing monitoring, and in accordance with Section 1009(h) of the Company Guide, if the Company is again determined to be below any of the continued listing standards within 12 months of the date of the January 21, 2021 letter, the Exchange will examine the relationship between the two incidents of noncompliance and re-evaluate the Company\u2019s method of financial recovery from the first incident. NYSE Regulation will then take the appropriate action, which, depending on the circumstances, may include truncating the compliance procedures described Section 1009 of the Company Guide or immediately initiating delisting proceedings.\nOn May 21, 2021, we received notice from the Exchange that the Company is not in compliance with the Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1007 of the Company given the Company failed to timely file (the \u201cFiling Delinquency\u201d) its Form 10-K for the 9-month transition period ended December 31, 2020 (the \u201cReport\u201d). We believe this delinquency will be cured via the filing of this Report.\nThe Company previously filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 6, 2021, to extend the due date for the Report. The Form 12b-25 disclosed that the Report was unable to be filed on time due to delays in assembling the financial information required to be reviewed by the Company\u2019s independent auditor, and in completing the accounting of certain transactions affecting the Company. Such further delay in filing the Report past the deadline set forth in the Form 12b-25 is due to issues that have arisen in connection with (i) finalizing the determination of the fair values of both assets and liabilities associated with the Company\u2019s acquisition of a controlling interest in Viking Energy Group, Inc. in December of 2020, and (ii) key personnel changes at the Company\u2019s independent auditing firm. The Company is taking steps to complete the required accounting and plans to file the Report as soon as practicable.\nDuring the six-month period from the date of the Filing Delinquency (the \u201cInitial Cure Period\u201d), the Exchange will monitor the Company and the status of the Report and any subsequent delayed filings, including through contact with the Company, until the Filing Delinquency is cured. If the Company fails to cure the Filing Delinquency within the Initial Cure Period, the Exchange may, in the Exchange\u2019s sole discretion, allow the Company\u2019s securities to be traded for up to an additional six-month period (the \u201cAdditional Cure Period\u201d) depending on the Company\u2019s specific circumstances. If the Exchange determines an Additional Cure Period is not appropriate, suspension and delisting procedures will commence in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 1010 hereof. If the Exchange determines that an Additional Cure Period of up to six months is appropriate and the Company fails to file its Delinquent Report and any subsequent delayed filings by the end of that period, suspension and delisting procedures will generally commence.\nIf we are unable to retain compliance with the NYSE American criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing. In addition, delisting from the NYSE American might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. Additionally, if we were delisted from the NYSE American and we are not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 registration statements (we are currently not eligible to use Form S-3 until potentially in mid-2023 due to late filings) and will instead be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement for any primary or secondary offerings of our common stock, which would delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and would increase the expenses of any offering, as, among other things, registration statements on Form S-1 are subject to SEC review and comments whereas take downs pursuant to a previously filed Form S-3 are not.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE American, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American, it would come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently have a volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock is and may remain volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain volatile in the future. Factors that could affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\nour actual or anticipated operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserve estimates;\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income/loss per share, net income/loss and cash flows, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in revenue, cash flows or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\npublic reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of our freely tradable common stock available in the public marketplace;\n\u00b7\ngeneral financial market conditions and oil and natural gas industry market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u00b7\nthe realization of any of the risk factors that we are subject to;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u00b7\nthe prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we produce;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of companies similar to the Company; and\n\u00b7\ndomestic and international economic, public health, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American under the symbol \u201cCEI.\u201d Our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.\nThese broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political, public health and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations, or global virus outbreaks may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. You should exercise caution before making an investment in us.\nA prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock could affect our ability to obtain additional financing which would adversely affect our operations.\nHistorically, we have relied on equity and debt financing as primary sources of financing. A prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock or a reduction in our accessibility to the global markets may result in our inability to secure additional financing which would have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNevada law and our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue shares of stock which shares may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe have authorized capital stock consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of May 16, 2022 , we had (i) 414,290,116 shares of common stock outstanding and (ii) 5,200 designated shares of Series C Preferred Stock, 1,605 of which were outstanding (iii) 25,000 authorized shares of Series G Preferred Stock of which 7,908 were outstanding (each as described in greater detail below under \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Description of Capital Stock\u201d). As a result, our Board of Directors has the ability to issue a large number of additional shares of common stock without stockholder approval, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), which if issued could cause substantial dilution to our then stockholders. Shares of additional preferred stock may also be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval, with voting powers and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers as determined by our Board of Directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding. As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors which cause the holders to have majority voting power over our shares, provide the holders of the preferred stock the right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may cause substantial dilution to our then common stock stockholders and/or have other rights and preferences greater than those of our common stock stockholders. Investors should keep in mind that the Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. Additionally, the dilutive effect of any preferred stock which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such preferred stock may have super voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide the preferred stockholders with substantial voting control over us subsequent to the date of this filing and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control. As a result, the issuance of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock may cause the value of our securities to decrease and/or become worthless.\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and/or satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock. Subject to certain consent rights of the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock, our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock (subject to NYSE American rules which limit among other things, the number of shares we can issue without stockholder approval to no more than 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to certain exceptions). These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and that dilution may be material.\nIf persons engage in short sales of our common stock, including sales of shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, convertible debentures and preferred stock, the price of our common stock may decline.\nSelling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. In addition, holders of options, warrants and other convertible securities will sometimes sell short knowing they can, in effect, cover through the exercise or conversion of options, warrants and other convertible securities, thus locking in a profit. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock issued upon exercise or conversion of options, warrants and other convertible securities could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market upon such exercise/conversion, which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. You could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of your investment as a result of short sales of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in expectations of future financial performance; fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes; issuances of dilutive common stock or other securities in the future; the addition or departure of key personnel; announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and the increase or decline in the price of oil and natural gas.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances of our common stock or resales in the open market will decrease the market price of our common stock. The impact of any such issuances or resales of our common stock on our market price may be increased as a result of the fact that our common stock is thinly, or infrequently, traded. The exercise of any options that we have or that we may grant to directors, executive officers and other employees in the future, the issuance of common stock in connection with acquisitions and other issuances of our common stock (including shares previously registered in our registration statements and prospectus supplements, and/or in connection with future registration statements or prospectus supplements) could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, future issuances of our common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could lower the market price of our common stock.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a fully reporting publicly traded company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a fully reporting public company. Specifically, we are required to prepare and file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Additionally, our officers, directors and significant stockholders are required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 and Schedules 13D/G with the SEC disclosing their ownership of the Company and changes in such ownership. Furthermore, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures. The costs and expenses of compliance with SEC rules and our filing obligations with the SEC, or our identification of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause the market price of our stock to decline in value.\nSecurities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities or industry analysts stop their coverage of us or additional securities and industry analysts fail to cover us in the future, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If any analyst or analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst or analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nDue to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our cost and expenses.\nWe are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the SEC that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and are required to pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase our expenses and may make it more complicated or time consuming for us to undertake certain corporate actions due to the fact that we may require the approval of the NYSE American for such transactions and/or NYSE American rules may require us to obtain stockholder approval for such transactions.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.\nWe may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Series C Preferred Stock\nThe full amount of premiums, interest and dividends through the maturity date of our Series C Preferred Stock is due upon the repayment/redemption or conversion, as applicable, of the Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock provides that all applicable dividends, which initially accrued in the amount of 24.95% per annum and which increase or decrease subject to the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, based on among other things, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, up to a maximum of 34.95% per annum, are due upon conversion or repayment/redemption (where applicable) thereof, for the full seven-year term of such securities.\nThe requirement that we pay all premiums and dividends through maturity and the adjustable nature of such premium and dividend rates, may force us to issue the holders significant additional shares of common stock, which may cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation, the Company has the option to redeem any or all shares of Series C Preferred Stock by paying Holder, in registered or unregistered shares of Common Stock valued at an amount per share equal to 100% of the Liquidation Value for the shares redeemed, and the Corporation will use its best efforts to register such shares.\nThe number of shares of common stock issuable in consideration for premiums, interest and dividends through maturity on the Series C Preferred Stock continue to be adjustable after the conversion of such securities.\nPursuant to the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, the conversion rate of such securities in connection with the premiums and dividends due on such securities through maturity (7 years, regardless of when converted), continues to be adjustable after the issuance of such securities. Specifically, such securities remain adjustable, based on a discount to the lowest daily volume weighted average price during a measuring period for a period of 30 or 60 days (depending on whether or not a Triggering Event has occurred, and potentially longer if certain equity conditions are not satisfied) after the applicable number of shares stated in the initial conversion notice have actually been received into the holder\u2019s designated brokerage account in electronic form and fully cleared for trading (subject to certain extensions described in the applicable securities). Because the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are limited to holding not more than 9.99% of the Company\u2019s common stock upon exercise/conversion of any security, they may not receive all of the shares due upon any conversion, until it has sold shares and been issued additional shares and as such, the beginning date for the applicable 30 or 60 day period after conversion is impossible to determine and may be a significant additional number of days after the initial conversion.\nIn the event of a decrease in the Company\u2019s stock price during the applicable measuring periods, the conversion rate of the premiums and dividends due on such applicable securities will adjust downward and holders of Series C Preferred Stock would be due additional shares of common stock for their conversions, which issuances may cause further significant dilution to existing stockholders and the sale of such shares may cause the value of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline in value. Furthermore, it is likely that the sale by holders of the shares of common stock received in connection with any conversion, during the applicable measuring period, will cause the value of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline in value and the conversion rate to decrease and will result in holder being due additional shares of common stock during the measuring period, which will trigger additional decreases in the value of the Company\u2019s common stock upon further public sales. If this were to occur, holder would be entitled to receive an increasing number of shares, upon conversion of the remaining securities, which could then be sold, triggering further price declines and conversions for even larger numbers of shares, which would cause additional dilution to our existing stockholders and would likely cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock will cause immediate and substantial dilution and the sale of such stock will cause significant downward pressure on our stock price.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders. Although holders may not receive shares of common stock exceeding 9.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately after affecting such conversion, this restriction does not prevent holders from receiving shares up to the 9.99% limit, selling those shares, and then receiving the rest of the shares it is due, in one or more tranches, while still staying below the 9.99% limit. If holders choose to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our common stock. Additionally, the continued sale of shares issuable upon successive conversions will likely create significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock as holders sells material amounts of our common stock over time and/or in a short period of time. This could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock and in turn result in holders receiving an ever-increasing number of additional shares of common stock upon conversion of its securities, and adjustments thereof, which in turn will likely lead to further dilution, reductions in the exercise/conversion price of holders securities and even more downward pressure on our common stock, which could lead to our common stock becoming devalued or worthless.\nHolders of Series C Preferred Stock Hold a Liquidation Preference in the Company.\nUpon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment or provision for payment of debts and other liabilities of the Company, prior to any distribution or payment made to the holders of Preferred Stock or Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders an amount with respect to each share of Series C Preferred Stock equal to $10,000.00, plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid Dividends thereon. Because the dividends currently require that interest be paid on the Face Value of between 24.95% and 34.95% per annum, for the entire seven-year term of the Series C Preferred Stock (even if payable sooner than seven years after the issuance date), the total liquidation value required to be paid to Discover upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company is approximately $133.9 million. Because our net assets total less than $133.9 million, it is likely that our common stockholders would not receive any amount in the event the Company was liquidated, dissolved or wound up, and the Series C Preferred shareholders would instead receive the entire amount of available funds after liquidation.\nIf the Company determines to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up its business and affairs, or upon closing or occurrence of any Deemed Liquidation Event, the Company will to the extent allowed under applicable law, but thereafter, prior to or concurrently with the closing, effectuation or occurrence any such action, redeem the Series C Preferred Stock for cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Holder, at the Early Redemption Price (defined below) if the event is prior to the Dividend Maturity Date, or at the Liquidation Value if the event is on or after the Dividend Maturity Date. Notwithstanding any other provision, the Company will not be required to redeem any shares of Series C Preferred Stock for cash solely because the Company does not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to issue upon receipt of a Delivery Notice, upon a maturity conversion, or for any other reason that is not solely within the control of the Company.\nA \u201cDeemed Liquidation Event\u201d means: (a) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is a constituent party or a subsidiary of the Company is a constituent party and the Company issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation, except (i) any such merger or consolidation involving the Company or a subsidiary in which the Company is the surviving or resulting Company, (ii) any merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the Company, (iii) any transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain more than 50% of the total voting power of such surviving entity, or (iv) the merger with Viking; (b) Company issues convertible or equity securities that are senior to the Series C Preferred Stock in any respect, other than the securities issued in the Merger; (c) Holder does not receive the number of Conversion Shares stated in a Delivery Notice with 5 Trading Days of the notice due to the occurrence of an event that is solely within the control of the Company and excluding any event that is not solely within the control of the Company; (d) trading of the Common Stock is halted or suspended by the Trading Market or any U.S. governmental agency for 10 or more consecutive trading days, due to the occurrence of an event that is solely within the control of the Company and excluding any event that is not solely within the control of the Company; or (e) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the sale or disposition (whether by merger or otherwise) of one or more subsidiaries of the Company if substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary or subsidiaries, except where one or more Holders initiate consideration of and vote upon a proposal for such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, or it is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, other than the Merger and except otherwise agreed to by holders holding a majority of the then outstanding Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe \u201cEarly Redemption Price\u201d is the sum of the following: (a) 100% of the Face Value, plus (b) the Conversion Premium, minus (c) any Dividends that have been paid, for each share of Series C Preferred Stock redeemed.\nThe \u201cConversion Premium\u201d for each share of Series C Preferred Stock means the Face Value, multiplied by the product of (i) the applicable Dividend Rate, and (ii) the number of whole years between the Issuance Date and the Dividend Maturity Date.\nThe \u201cDividend Maturity Date\u201d means the date that is 7 years after the Issuance Date.\nHolders of our Series C Preferred Stock, effectively have the ability to consent to any material transaction involving the Company.\nDue to the restrictions placed on the Company as a result of the Series C Preferred Stock, including, but not limited to the significant liquidation preference discussed above and the fact that, as long as there are any issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, we agreed that we would not issue or enter into or amend an agreement pursuant to which we may issue any shares of common stock, other than (a) for restricted securities with no registration rights, (b) in connection with a strategic acquisition, (c) in an underwritten public offering, or (d) at a fixed price; or issue or amend any debt or equity securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or including the right to receive, shares of common stock (i) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon or varies with, the trading prices of or quotations for the shares of common stock at any time after the initial issuance of the security or (ii) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of the security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the common stock. Holder has to effectively consent to any material transaction involving the Company. In the event holders do not consent to any such transaction, we may be prohibited (either effectively or otherwise) from completing a material transaction in the future, including, but not limited to a combination or acquisition which may be accretive to stockholders. Furthermore, holders may condition the approval of a future transaction, which conditions may not be favorable to stockholders.\nSome of our Series C Preferred Stockholders have rights of first refusal to provide further funding and favored nation rights.\nWe have granted the Investor a right of first offer to match any offer for financing we receive from any person while the shares of Series C Preferred Stock sold pursuant to the June 2020 Purchase Agreement are outstanding, except for debt financings not convertible into common stock, which are excluded from such right to match. Such right of first refusal may delay or prevent us from raising funding in the future.\nWe have also agreed with some of Series C Preferred Stock holders that if we issue any security with any term more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to the Series C Preferred Stock holder, then we would notify Series C Preferred Stock holder of such additional or more favorable term and such term, at the holder\u2019s option, may become a part of the transaction documents with the holder, including the Series C Preferred Stock and the agreements relating to the sale thereof. Such favored nations provisions may make it more costly to complete transactions in the future, may prevent future transactions from occurring and/or may provide the holders additional rights than they currently have, all of which may cause significant dilution to existing stockholders, and/or cause the value of our common stock to decline in value.\nThe holders of our Series C Preferred Stock, subject to applicable contractual restrictions, and/or a third party, may sell short our common stock, which could have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series C Preferred Stock are currently prohibited from selling the Company\u2019s stock short; however, in the event a trigger event occurs under the Series C Preferred Stock such restriction is waived. Additionally, nothing prohibits a third party from selling the Company\u2019s common stock short based on their belief that due to the dilution caused by the conversions of our Series C Preferred Stock, that the trading price of our common stock will decline in value. The significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock as any of our Series C Preferred Stockholders sell material amounts of our common stock could encourage investors to short sell our common stock. This could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock and in turn result in our Series C Preferred Stock holders receiving additional shares of common stock upon exercise/conversion of its securities, and adjustments thereof.\nThe Company\u2019s CEO, James Doris, holds Viking preferred stock which, upon termination from Camber could afford him enough shareholder votes to control Viking, and dilute Camber\u2019s ownership interest below 51%.\nThe Company\u2019s CEO and director, James Doris, holds 28,092 shares of Viking\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock, with each share of Viking preferred stock entitling the holder to convert such share of Viking preferred stock into 28,092 shares of Viking common stock, and entitling the holder to 37,500 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation on the later of: (i) July 1, 2022; or (ii) the date on which Camber Energy, Inc. (\u201cCamber\u201d) no longer owns or is entitled to own at least 51% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation\u2019s Common Stock. By virtue of such preferred stock ownership, and the possibility of Camber owning less than 51% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company after July 1, 2022, Mr. Doris could control the election of the members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and generally exercise control over the affairs of Viking. Pursuant to the December 23 Purchase Agreement, whereby the Company acquired 51% of Viking, Viking is generally obligated (subject to certain limitations) to issue additional shares of Viking common stock to Camber to ensure that Camber shall own at least 51% of the common stock of Viking through July 1, 2022, which effectively prohibits Mr. Doris from obtaining control over the affairs of Viking at least until July 1, 2022. There can be no assurance that after July 1, 2022, conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to Mr. Doris\u2019s ownership of the preferred stock, or that such conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the Company.", "PERMNO": 92571, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CEI"}
