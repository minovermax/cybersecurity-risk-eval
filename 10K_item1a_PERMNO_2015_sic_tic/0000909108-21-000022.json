{"cik": "909108", "company": "DIAMOND HILL INVESTMENT GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources, as well as the market price of our common stock, are subject to various risks, including those risks mentioned below and those risks that are discussed from time-to-time in our other periodic filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision regarding our common shares. There may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and the value of our common stock. Please see \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d within Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Risks\nPoor investment results or adverse reviews of our products could affect our ability to attract new clients or reduce our AUM, potentially negatively impacting revenue and net income.\nIf we fail to deliver acceptable investment results for our clients, both in the short and long term, we could experience diminished investor interest and a decreased level of AUM.\nInvestment strategies are assessed and rated by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, and publications. Investors can be influenced by such ratings. If a strategy receives an adverse report, it could negatively influence our AUM and our revenue.\nOur success depends on our key personnel, and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.\nOur success depends on highly skilled personnel, including portfolio managers, research analysts, and management, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in the investment management industry. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. Other than our Chief Executive Officer, our employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment at any time. We may not be able to retain or replace key personnel. In order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. The loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and clients. A loss of client assets resulting from the departure of key personnel may materially decrease our revenues and net income.\nOur investment results and/or the growth in our AUM may be constrained if appropriate investment opportunities are not available or if we close certain of our investment strategies to new investors.\nOur ability to deliver strong investment results depends in large part on our ability to identify appropriate investment opportunities in which to invest client assets. If we are unable to identify sufficient investment opportunities for existing and new client assets on a timely basis, our investment results could be adversely affected. The risk that appropriate investment opportunities may be unavailable is influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions, and is likely to increase if our AUM increases rapidly. In addition, if we determine that sufficient investment opportunities are not available for an investment strategy, or we believe that it is necessary in order to continue to produce attractive returns from an investment strategy, we will consider closing the investment strategy to new investors. As of December 31, 2020, we have one investment strategy closed to new investors. If we misjudge the point at which it would be optimal to close an investment strategy, the investment results of the strategy could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business.\nOur investment products compete against investment products and services from:\n\u2022Asset management firms;\n\u2022Mutual fund companies;\n\u2022Commercial banks and thrift institutions;\n\u2022Insurance companies;\n\u2022Exchange traded funds;\n\u2022Private funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds; and\n\u2022Brokerage and investment banking firms.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater resources and may operate in more markets or offer a broader range of products, including passively managed or \u201cindex\u201d products. Some of these institutions operate in a different regulatory environment, which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. We compete with other providers of investment services primarily based upon our philosophy, performance, and client service. Some institutions have a broader array of products and distribution channels, which makes it more difficult for us to compete. If current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, AUM, revenues, and net income. If we are required to lower our fees to remain competitive, our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed, especially over shorter periods of time, and our expenses may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues. Additionally, over the past several years, investors have\ngenerally shown a preference for passive investment products, such as index and exchange traded funds, over actively managed strategies. If this trend continues, our AUM may be negatively impacted.\nMarket and competitive pressures in recent years have created a trend towards lower management fees in the asset management industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure. As a result, a shift in our AUM from higher to lower fee generating clients and strategies could result in a decrease in profitability even if our AUM increases or remains unchanged.\nThe loss of access to, or increased fees required by, third-party distribution sources to market our portfolios and access our client base could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to attract additional AUM is dependent on our relationship with third-party financial intermediaries. We compensate some of these intermediaries for access to investors and for various marketing services provided. These distribution sources and client bases may not continue to be accessible to us for reasonable terms, or at all. If such access is restricted or eliminated, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Fees paid to financial intermediaries for investor access and marketing services have generally increased in recent years. If such fee increases continue, refusal to pay them could restrict our access to those client bases while paying them could adversely affect our profitability.\nA significant portion of our revenues are based on advisory and administrative agreements with the Funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.\nWe are highly dependent on our contractual relationships with the Funds. If our advisory or administration agreements with the Funds were terminated or not renewed, or were amended or modified to reduce fees, we would be materially and adversely affected. Generally, these agreements are terminable by either party upon 60 days\u2019 prior written notice without penalty. The agreements are subject to annual approval by either: (i) the board of trustees of the Funds, or (ii) a vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Fund. These agreements automatically terminate in the event of their assignment by either us or the Funds. We generated approximately 75%, 77%, and 79% of our 2020, 2019, and 2018 revenues, respectively, from our advisory and administrative contracts with the Funds, including 26%, 17%, and 11% from the advisory contracts with the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund, and the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund, respectively, during 2020. The loss of any of the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund, or the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund contracts would have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we have a strong relationship with the Funds and their boards of trustees, and we have no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be renewed in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and other possible similar pandemics or outbreaks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in temporary, and sometimes prolonged, closures of many corporate offices, retail stores, manufacturing facilities, and factories around the world. In addition, as COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe, supply chains worldwide have been interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and an increasing number of individuals have and may continue to become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. Governmental mandates to control the outbreak may require additional forced shutdowns and limit the re-opening of various business facilities for extended or indefinite periods. COVID-19, and the various governmental, industry, and consumer actions related to the containment thereof, are having, and could continue to have, negative effects on our business and risk exposure. These effects include, without limitation, potential significant financial market volatility, decreases in the demand for our investment products, changes in consumer behavior and preferences, limitations on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel, potential financial and operational difficulties of vendors and suppliers, significant changes in economic or political conditions, and financial market declines or recessions that could generally negatively affect the level of our AUM and consequently our revenue, investment income (loss), and net income.\nThe global effect of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and it is uncertain what the effect of various legislative and other responses that have been taken, and that may be taken in the future in the United States and other countries, will have on the economy, financial markets, international trade, our industries, our businesses, and the businesses of our clients and vendors. Many countries, including the United States, have reacted to both the initial outbreak and subsequent outbreaks by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel to and from actual and potentially affected areas, and the outbreak could have a continued adverse effect on economic and market conditions. The future effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on global markets is difficult to predict, and it is uncertain the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operating results or disrupt the duration of any potential business. The emergence of new variants of the virus and delay or difficulties in administering vaccines could continue to cause uncertainty. Any potential effect on our business and results of operations will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the spread of the virus, all of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the way we operate. While we have in place business continuity plans that address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our personnel, facilities, and technologies that enable our personnel to work effectively from home, no assurance can be given that the steps we have taken will continue to be effective or appropriate. Although our employees have been able to continue conducting business while working remotely for an extended period of time, operational challenges may arise in the future, which may reduce our organizational efficiency or effectiveness, and increase operational, compliance, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, because most of our employees have not previously worked remotely for such an extended period of time, we are unsure of the impact that the remote work environment and lack of in-person meetings with colleagues, clients, and business partners will have on the growth of our business and the results of our operations. Many of our key service providers also have transitioned to working remotely for an extended period of time. If we or they were to experience material disruptions in the ability of our or their employees to work remotely (e.g., from illness due to the COVID-19 pandemic or disruption in internet-based communication systems and networks), our ability to operate our business could be materially adversely disrupted. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and/or reputation.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depend on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to COVID-19 or any similar pandemic could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, local and foreign economies will likely require time to recover, the length of which is unknown and during which the United States or other countries may experience a recession. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by any such recession.\nTo the extent the effects of COVID-19 adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section.\nOperational Risks\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer or other systems or otherwise, could severely harm our business.\nAs part of our business, we collect, process, and transmit sensitive and confidential information about our clients and employees, as well as proprietary information about our business. We have policies and procedures pursuant to which we take numerous security measures to prevent cyberattacks of various kinds as well as fraudulent and inadvertent activity by persons who have been granted access to such confidential information. Nevertheless, our systems, like all technology systems, remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can result in theft or corruption of information. In addition, we share information with third parties upon whom we rely for various functions. The systems of such third parties also are vulnerable to cyber threats. Attacks can come from unrelated third parties through the internet, from access to hardware removed from our premises or those of third parties or from employees acting intentionally or inadvertently.\nCybersecurity incidents can involve, among other things: (i) deliberate attacks designed to corrupt our information systems and make them unusable by us to operate our business; (ii) theft of information used by the perpetrators for financial and other gain; or (iii) inadvertent releases of information by employees or third parties with whom we do business.\nCyberattacks that corrupt our information systems and make them unusable could impair our ability to trade securities in our clients\u2019 accounts. Corruption of the systems of our third-party vendors could impact us to the same extent as corruption of our own systems. If information about our employees is intentionally stolen or inadvertently made public, that information could be used to commit identity theft, obtain credit in an employee\u2019s name, or steal from an employee. If information about our business is obtained by unauthorized persons, whether through intentional attacks or inadvertent releases of information, it could be used to harm our competitive position.\nWhether information is corrupted, stolen, or inadvertently disclosed, and regardless of the type and nature of the information (e.g., proprietary information about our business or personal information about clients or employees), the results could be multiple and materially harmful to us, including the following:\n\u2022Our reputation could be harmed, resulting in the loss of clients, vendors, and employees or making payments or concessions to such persons to maintain our relationships with them;\n\u2022Our inability to operate our business fully, even if temporarily, and thus, fulfill contracts with clients or vendors, could result in terminations of contracts and loss of revenue;\n\u2022Harm suffered by clients or vendors whose contracts have been breached, or by clients, vendors, or employees whose information is compromised, could result in costly litigation against us;\n\u2022Our need to focus attention on remediation of a cyber problem could take our attention away from the operation of our business, resulting in lost revenue;\n\u2022We could incur costs to repair systems made inoperable by a cyberattack and to make changes to our systems to reduce future cyber threats. Those changes could include, among other things, obtaining additional technologies as well as employing additional personnel and training employees; and\n\u2022The interruption of our business or theft of proprietary information could harm our ability to compete.\nAll of the above potential impacts of a cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers while reducing costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to implement effectively new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect our growth, revenue, and profit.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in losses, or limit our growth.\nWe are dependent on the capacity and reliability of the communications, information and technology systems supporting our operations, whether developed, owned, or operated internally by us or by third parties. Operational risks, such as trading or operational errors, interruption of our financial, accounting, trading, compliance and other data processing systems, the loss of data contained in such systems, or compromised systems due to cyberattack, could result in a disruption of our business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, and thus, adversely affect our business.\nNegative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including trading practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities and from actions taken by governmental regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain clients, could expose us to potential litigation or regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility.\nTrading in our common shares is limited, which may adversely affect the time and the price at which you can sell your shares.\nAlthough our common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the shares are held by a relatively small number of shareholders, and trading in our common shares is relatively inactive. The spread between the bid and the asked prices is often wide. As a result, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares on short notice, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price. In addition, certain shareholders, including certain of our directors and officers, own a significant number of shares. The sale of a large number of shares by any such individual could temporarily depress the market price of our shares.\nIndustry, Market, and Economic Risks\nOur AUM, which impacts revenue, is subject to significant fluctuations.\nThe majority of our revenue is calculated as a percentage of AUM or is related to the general performance of the equity securities markets. A decline in securities prices or in the sale of investment products, or an increase in fund redemptions, generally will reduce revenue and net income. Financial market declines will generally negatively impact the level of our AUM, and consequently, our revenue and net income. A recession or other economic or political events, whether in the United States or globally, could also adversely impact our revenue, if such events led to a decreased demand for products, a higher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices.\nOur investment approach may underperform other investment approaches during certain market conditions.\nOur investment strategies are best suited for investors with long-term investment time horizons. Our investment strategies may not perform well during certain periods of time. Additionally, we could have common positions and industry concentrations across our strategies at the same time. As such, factors leading to underperformance may impact multiple strategies simultaneously.\nOur investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio.\nWe currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in investments that we sponsor. All of these investments are subject to market risk and our non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by adverse market performance. Fluctuations in investment income are expected to occur in the future.\nRegulatory Risks\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax obligations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the United States. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken or implement changes in tax policy, which may result in the assessment of additional taxes. We regularly assess the appropriateness of our tax positions and reporting. We cannot provide assurances, however, that we will accurately predict the outcomes of audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could be unfavorable.\nOur business is subject to substantial governmental regulation, which can change frequently and may increase costs of compliance, reduce revenue, result in fines, penalties, and lawsuits for noncompliance, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal securities laws, including the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act, the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In addition, we are subject to significant regulation and oversight by the SEC. Changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements could have a significant effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, increased expenses and reduced investor interest in certain Funds and other investment products we offer. We continually monitor legislative, tax, regulatory, accounting, and compliance developments that could impact our business. We and our directors, officers, and employees could be subject to lawsuits or regulatory proceedings for violations of such laws and regulations, which could result in the payment of fines or penalties and cause reputational harm to us which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as divert management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur insurance policies may not cover all losses and costs to which we may be exposed.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86818, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "DHIL"}
