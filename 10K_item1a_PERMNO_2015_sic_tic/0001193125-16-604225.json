Risk Factors\nReaders should carefully consider, in connection with other information disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks and uncertainties described below. The following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. However, other factors, besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this Report or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), also could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. We cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks we may face; additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not believed by us to be material may also negatively impact us. These risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those discussed in forward looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please also refer to the section titled \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from Popular.\nOur services to Popular account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that our services to Popular will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In 2015, products and services billed through Popular accounted for approximately 45% of our total revenues, of which approximately 83% (or approximately 37% of total revenues) are derived from core bank processing and related services for Popular and approximately 17% (or approximately 8% of total revenues) are transaction processing activities driven by third parties. The majority of Popular\u2019s business is presented in the Business Solutions segment. If Popular were to terminate, or fail to perform under, the Master Services Agreement or our other material agreements with Popular, our revenues could be materially reduced.\nWe depend, in part, on our merchant relationships and our alliance with Banco Popular, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular, to grow our merchant acquiring business. If we are unable to maintain these relationships and this alliance, our business may be adversely affected.\nGrowth in our merchant acquiring business is derived primarily from acquiring new merchant relationships, new and enhanced product and service offerings, cross selling products and services into existing relationships, the shift of consumer spending to increased usage of electronic forms of payment, and the strength of our relationship with Banco Popular. A substantial portion of our business is generated from our ISO Agreement with Banco Popular.\nBanco Popular acts as a merchant referral source and provides sponsorship into the ATH, Visa, Discover and MasterCard networks for merchants, as well as card association sponsorship, clearing and settlement services. We provide transaction processing and related functions. Both alliance partners may provide management, sales, marketing, and other administrative services. We rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships, our alliance with Banco Popular and other distribution channels. There can be no guarantee that this growth will continue and the loss or deterioration of these relationships could negatively impact our business and result in a reduction of our revenue and profit.\nIf we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable terms, we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFailure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. Our contracts with private clients generally run for a period of one to five years, except for the Master Services Agreement with Popular, which has a term of 15 years, and approximately 9.5 years remaining on the contract, and provide for termination fees upon early termination. Our government contracts generally run for one year without automatic\nrenewal periods due to requirements of the government procurement rules. Our standard merchant contract has an initial term of one or three years, with automatic one-year renewal periods. At the end of the contract term, clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates and contract terms that are favorable to us, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our notes and senior secured credit facilities.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2015, the total principal amount of our indebtedness was approximately $674 million. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for you, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including for our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings are predominantly at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our other debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash interest expense on the senior secured credit facilities amounted to $21.5 million. Our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because the entire amount of the indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $670 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates over our floor(s) on our debt balances outstanding as of December 31, 2015 under the senior secured credit facilities would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $6.7 million.\nWe rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations.\nOur businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of transactions. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems or applications fail or have other significant shortcomings or limitations, we could be materially adversely affected. We are similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently\nmanipulates our operations or systems. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, disease pandemics or other unanticipated damage to property or physical assets. Such an incident occurred on January 9, 2016 due to a software technology glitch, when our payments network suffered a two hour interruption of service. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us. In addition, there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, by causing a loss of confidence in our services that leads to a decrease in use of our services, and by exposing us to litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions or losses not covered by insurance.\nIf our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill were to become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), definitive useful life intangibles are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded.\nWe conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill during the third quarter of 2015 using August 31, 2015 as our annual evaluation date. The average estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units, therefore, no impairment was recorded.\nOur risk management procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or helping us mitigate our risk exposure against all types of risks.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing industry, and we have experienced significant change in the past four years, including our separation from Popular following the Merger, our initial public offering in April 2013 and our listing on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Accordingly, we may not be fully effective in identifying, monitoring and managing our risks. In some cases, the information we use to perform our risk assessments may not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. In other cases, our risk assessments may depend upon information that we may not have or cannot obtain. If we are not fully effective or we are not always successful in identifying all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we could be subject to losses, penalties, litigation or regulatory actions that could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations and industry security requirements imposed on providers of services to financial institutions and card processing services could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation.\nAs part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers. In addition, we collect personal consumer data, such as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, cardholder data and payment history records. The uninterrupted operation of our information systems and the confidentiality of the customer/consumer information that resides on such systems are critical to the successful operations of our business. Despite the safeguards we have in place, unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information, the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations. These risks are increased when we transmit information over the Internet. Our visibility in the global payments industry may attract hackers to conduct attacks on our systems that could compromise the security of our data or could cause interruptions in the operations of our businesses and subject us to increased costs, litigation and other liabilities. There is also a possibility of mishandling or misuse, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees acting contrary to our policies, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise improperly taken by third parties. An information breach in the system and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could have a longer and more significant impact on the business operations than a hardware failure and could result in claims against us for misuse of personal information, such as identity theft.\nAdditionally, as a provider of services to financial institutions, such as card processing services, we are subject directly (or indirectly through our clients) to the same laws, regulations, industry standards and limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the customers themselves. If we fail to comply with these regulations, standards and limitations, we could be exposed to claims for breach of contract, governmental proceedings, or prohibitions on card processing services. In addition, as more restrictive privacy laws, rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or local level or by a specific industry body, the change could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards required by law, industry standards or contracts.\nAny inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or failure to comply with privacy regulations and industry security requirements could cause our existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us, and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers, damage our reputation and/or adversely impact our relationship with administrative agencies.\nWe may experience breakdowns in our processing systems that could damage customer relations and expose us to liability.\nWe depend heavily on the reliability of our processing systems in our core businesses. A system outage or data loss, regardless of reason, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss, but we may also be liable to third parties. Some of our contractual agreements with financial institutions require the crediting of certain fees if our systems do not meet certain specified service levels. To successfully operate our business, we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption, including from events that may be beyond our control. Events that could cause system interruptions include, but are not limited to, fire, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, computer viruses, terrorist acts and war. Although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures. We perform the vast majority of disaster recovery operations ourselves, though we utilize select third parties for some aspects of recovery. To the extent we outsource our disaster recovery, we are at risk of the vendor\u2019s unresponsiveness in the event of breakdowns in our systems. Furthermore, our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.\nLack of system integrity, fraudulent payments or credit quality related to funds settlement could result in a financial loss.\nWe settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and process funds transactions from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, ACH payments, electronic benefits transfer transactions and check clearing that supports consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. These payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties, the facilitation of the payment and, in some cases, the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments. If the continuity of operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us.\nWe may experience defects, development delays, installation difficulties, system failure, or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.\nMany of our services are based on sophisticated software, technology and computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services. Further, the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers. Finally, our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses or other cyber-attacks. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, a trend we expect will continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information.\nAs part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data. We also operate payment, cash access and electronic card systems. A successful cyber-attack on our system could result in: (1) interruption of business operations; (2) delay in market acceptance; (3) additional development and remediation costs; (4) diversion of technical and other resources; (5) loss of customers; (6) negative publicity and loss of reputation; or (7) exposure to liability claims.\nAny one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability to adopt technology to changing industry and customer needs or trends may affect our competitiveness or demand for our products, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to technological advancements, developing industry standards and changing customer needs and preferences. Also, our customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses. We must anticipate and respond to these industry and customer changes in order to remain competitive within our relative markets. Our inability to respond to new competitors and technological advancements could impact all of our businesses. For example, the ability to adopt technological advancements surrounding POS technology available to merchants could have an impact on our merchant acquiring business. Particular to this example is the \u201cEMV\u201d credit and debit card authentication methodology that the card associations are mandating to processors, issuers and acquirers in the payment industry. Compliance deadlines for EMV mandates vary by country and by payment network. We are investing significant resources and man-hours to develop and implement this methodology in all our payment related platforms. However, we are not certain if or when our financial institution customers will use or\naccept the methodology and the time it will take for this technology to be rolled-out to all customer ATM and POS devices connected to our platforms or adopted by our card issuing clients. Non-compliance with EMV mandates could result in lost business or financial losses from fraud or fines from network operators.\nConsolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of mergers and consolidations in the banking and financial services industry. Mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenues. Further, if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. It is also possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the credit risk that our merchants will be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we also may be liable. For example, as the merchant acquirer, we are contingently liable for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants. For certain merchants, if we are unable to collect this amount from the merchant, due to the merchant\u2019s insolvency or other reasons, we will bear the loss for the amount of the refund or chargeback paid to the cardholder. Notwithstanding our adherence to industry standards with regards to the acceptance of new merchants and certain steps to screen for credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreased competition or changes in consumer spending or payment preferences could adversely affect our business.\nA decline in the market for our services, either as a result of increased competition, a decrease in consumer spending or a shift in consumer payment preferences, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and existing competitors expand their services. Some of these competitors could have greater overall financial, technical and marketing resources than us, which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes. Some competitors could have or may develop a lower cost structure. New competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge, resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenues and profit margin. Further, if consumer confidence decreases in a way that adversely affects consumer spending, whether in conjunction with a global economic downturn or otherwise, we could experience a reduction in the volume of transactions we process. In addition, if we fail to respond to changes in technology or consumer payment preferences, we could lose business to competitors.\nChanges in credit card association or other network rules or standards could adversely affect our business.\nIn order to provide our transaction processing services, several of our subsidiaries are registered with or certified by Visa, Discover and MasterCard and other networks as members or as service providers for member institutions. As such, we and many of our customers are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our customers to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us, acquirer customers, processing customers and merchants. Visa, Discover, MasterCard and other networks, some of which are our competitors, set the standards with respect to which we must comply. The termination of Banco Popular\u2019s or our subsidiaries\u2019 member registration or our\nsubsidiaries\u2019 status as a certified service provider, or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to or through our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in interchange fees or other fees charged by card associations and debit networks could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, card associations and debit networks change interchange, processing and other fees, which could impact our merchant acquiring and payment processing businesses. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in our merchant acquiring and payment processing businesses absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept Visa, Discover and MasterCard cards are dependent upon our continued Visa, Discover and MasterCard registration and financial institution sponsorship.\nIn order to provide our Visa, Discover and MasterCard transaction processing services, we must be registered as a merchant processor of Visa, Discover and MasterCard. These designations are dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks of those organizations. If our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us, we would need to find another financial institution to serve as a sponsor, which could prove to be difficult and/or more expensive. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship we may no longer be able to provide processing services to the affected customers which would negatively impact our revenues and earnings.\nFor purposes of the BHC Act, for as long as we are deemed to be controlled by Popular, we will be subject to supervision and examination by U.S. federal banking regulators, and our activities will be limited to those permissible for Popular. Furthermore, as a technology service provider to regulated financial institutions, we are subject to additional regulatory oversight and examination. As a regulated institution, we may be required to obtain regulatory approval before engaging in certain new activities or businesses, whether organically or by acquisition.\nFor so long as we are deemed to be a \u201csubsidiary\u201d of Popular for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d), in other words deemed to be controlled by Popular, we will be subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The BHC Act defines \u201ccontrol\u201d differently than GAAP. As a deemed subsidiary, we may conduct only those activities that are authorized for our deemed parent, which depend on whether it is treated as a bank holding company or a financial holding company. The activities that are permissible for subsidiaries of bank holding companies are those that are treated as closely related to banking; those that are permissible for subsidiaries of financial holding companies generally include activities that are financial in nature or complementary to financial activities. In addition, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council because we are a technology service provider to regulated financial institutions, including Banco Popular.\nNew lines of business, other new activities, acquisitions that we may wish to commence or undertake in the future and the manner in which we conduct our business may not be permissible for us under the BHC Act, Regulation K or other relevant U.S. federal banking laws or may require the approval of the Federal Reserve Board or any other applicable U.S. federal banking regulator. In addition, deals may take longer, be more costly, or make us less attractive as a buyer. Additional regulatory requirements may be imposed if Popular is subject to any enforcement action. More generally, the Federal Reserve Board has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices submitted by Popular on our behalf with respect to new activities, the acquisition of businesses or assets, or the reconfiguration of existing operations. Any such action by the Federal Reserve Board may also depend on our ability to comply with the standards imposed by our regulators. There\ncan be no assurance that any required regulatory approvals will be obtained. In addition, further restrictions placed on Popular as a result of supervisory or enforcement actions may restrict us or our activities in certain circumstances, even if these actions are unrelated to conduct our business.\nChanges in laws, regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect the products and services we provide and markets in which we operate.\nWe and our customers are subject to U.S. federal, Puerto Rico and other countries\u2019 laws, rules and regulations that affect the electronic payments industry. Our customers are subject to numerous laws, rules and regulations applicable to banks, financial institutions, processors and card issuers in the United States and abroad. We are subject to regulation because of our activities in the countries where we carry them out and because of our relationship with Popular, and at times we are also affected by the laws, rules and regulations to which our customers are subject. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, even an inadvertent failure by us to comply with laws, rules and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our reputation or brands.\nFurthermore, regulation of the electronic payment card industry, including regulations applicable to us and our customers, has increased significantly in recent years. There is also increasing scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the manner in which payment card networks and card issuers set various fees, from which some of our customers derive significant revenue. For example, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in the United States. The Durbin Amendment contains requirements relating to payment card networks. To implement this provision, the Federal Reserve adopted rules which took effect on October 1, 2011 and April 1, 2012. These rules, among other things, place certain restrictions on the interchange transaction fees that a card issuer can receive for an electronic debit transaction originated at a merchant and also places various exclusivity prohibitions and routing requirements on such transactions. To date, the Durbin Amendment has had mixed implications for our business, but the overall net impact has been positive due to lower interchange costs improving the overall margins of the business. However, we cannot assure you that this trend will continue, and we believe that any future impact (positive or negative) resulting from the Durbin Amendment and subsequent developments is uncertain due to the competitive landscape in which we operate. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules-Regulatory Reform and Other Legislative Initiatives.\u201d\nFurther changes to laws, rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on us. We have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive and the amount of our cash flow and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business concentration in Puerto Rico imposes risks.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 86% and 87%, respectively, of our total revenues were generated from our operations in Puerto Rico. In addition, some revenues that are generated from our operations outside Puerto Rico are dependent upon our operations in Puerto Rico. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the economic and political conditions in Puerto Rico, and could be significantly adversely impacted by adverse economic or political developments in Puerto Rico.\nIn 2015, the government of Puerto Rico was our second largest customer representing approximately 9% of our total revenues. Revenues from the government of Puerto Rico come from numerous agencies and public corporations. A substantial portion of the services we provide to the government of Puerto Rico is considered mission-critical. Some of the government-sponsored initiatives we provide are indirectly funded in part by U.S. federal government programs. While we believe that the government of Puerto Rico will continue to engage our services despite the challenging financial situation it is currently facing, a failure of the government to do so could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, severe weather conditions that are prevalent in tropical climates and other natural disasters, could negatively affect, among other things, our ability to provide services, as well as our physical locations, property and equipment, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt obligations could slow the Puerto Rico economy, delay Government payments and affect consumer spending.\nIn February 2014, the principal nationally recognized statistical rating organizations downgraded the general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other debt obligations of Puerto Rico instrumentalities to non-investment grade categories. The downgrades are based mostly on concerns about financial flexibility and a reduced capacity to borrow in the financial markets. If the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities (collectively the \u201cGovernment\u201d) is unable to access the capital markets to place new debt or roll its upcoming maturities, the Government may reduce spending, impose new taxes, and take other actions which could slow the economy. A prolonged recession or future fiscal measures may also impact our business. The continuing challenging economic environment could affect our customer base, depress general consumer spending, and lengthen the Government\u2019s payments, thus increasing our Government accounts receivables; these outcomes, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther ratings downgrades for the Government have occurred since then and there continues to be significant doubt regarding the Government\u2019s liquidity and its ability to pay outstanding debt obligations. Certain measures have been taken to address the fiscal crisis, including an increase in the sales tax rate, imposing a 4% business to business tax, and several spending cuts. Furthermore, the Government has shown indications that it might not be able to make certain scheduled payments on its debt obligations. On August 3, 2015, the Government defaulted for the first time on the Public Finance Corporation bonds and only made a partial interest payment on that obligation. The Government has indicated that it is likely to default on additional debt payment obligations that come due in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company has no direct exposure to the Government\u2019s debt obligations, including those of its instrumentalities or municipalities. The Company has accounts receivable with the Puerto Rico government and its agencies amounting to $18.4 million as of December 31, 2015 down from $21.4 million as of December 31, 2014.\nThere are risks associated with our presence in international markets, including political or economic instability.\nOur financial performance may be significantly affected by general economic, political and social conditions in the emerging markets where we operate. Many countries in Latin America have suffered significant economic, political and social crises in the past, and these events may occur again in the future. Instability in Latin America has been caused by many different factors, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign exchange variation;\n\u2022\nsignificant governmental influence over local economies;\n\u2022\nsubstantial fluctuations in economic growth;\n\u2022\nhigh levels of inflation;\n\u2022\nexchange controls or restrictions on expatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nhigh domestic interest rates;\n\u2022\nwage and price controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental economic or tax policies;\n\u2022\nimposition of trade barriers;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulation which may restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation; and\n\u2022\noverall political, social and economic instability.\nAdverse economic, political and social conditions in the Latin America markets where we operate may create uncertainty regarding our operating environment, which could have a material adverse effect on our company.\nOur business in countries outside the United States and transactions with foreign governments increase our compliance risks and exposes us to business risks.\nOur operations outside the United States could expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other local governments or organizations. The U.S. Departments of the Treasury and Justice (the \u201cAgencies\u201d), the SEC and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, the FCPA and other federal statutes. Under economic sanctions laws, the Agencies may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities involving sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs. In addition, we are also subject to compliance with local government regulations. If any of the risks described above materialize, it could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThese regulations also prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by the United States and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations and deal with government entities and financial institutions in countries known to experience corruption, particularly certain emerging countries in Latin America, and further international expansion may involve more of these countries. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees or consultants may engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security which regulates the export, re-export and re-transfer abroad of covered items made or originating in the United States as well as the transfer of covered U.S.-origin technology abroad. We have adopted an Export Management Compliance Policy, a comprehensive compliance program under which the goods and technologies that we export are identified and classified under the EAR to make sure they are being exported in compliance with the requirements of the EAR. However, there can be no assurance that we have not violated the EAR in past transactions or that our new policies and procedures will prevent us from violating the EAR in every transaction in which we engage. Any such violations of the EAR could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions being imposed on us, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, some financial institutions refuse, even in the absence of a regulatory requirement, to provide services to companies operating in certain countries or engaging in certain practices because of concerns that the compliance efforts perceived to be necessary may outweigh the usefulness of the service relationship. Our operations outside the United States make it more likely that financial institutions may refuse to conduct business with us for this type of reason. Any such refusal could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the targets of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes. If we are found to have failed to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations in these instances, we and our subsidiaries could be exposed to fines, sanctions and other penalties or other governmental investigations.\nWe and our subsidiaries conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the target of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes, including Cuba. As a U.S.-based entity, we and our subsidiaries are obligated to comply with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments, or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with these sanctions and embargoes may result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us or other governmental investigations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities.\nFor these reasons, we have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. These policies and procedures include the use of software to screen transactions we process for evidence of sanctioned-country and persons involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties of identifying all transactions of our customers\u2019 customers that may involve a sanctioned country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable U.S. laws and regulations in every transaction in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we process transactions on behalf of the aforementioned financial institutions through the aforementioned payment networks, we have processed a limited number of transactions potentially involving sanctioned countries and there can be no assurances that, in the future, we will not inadvertently process such transactions. Due to a variety of factors, including technical failures and limitations of our transaction screening process, conflicts between U.S. and local laws, political or other concerns in certain countries in which we and our subsidiaries operate, and/or failures in our ability effectively to control employees operating in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, we have not rejected every transaction originating from or otherwise involving sanctioned countries, or persons and there can be no assurances that, in the future, we will not inadvertently fail to reject such transactions.\nOn June 25, 2010, EVERTEC Group discovered potential violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (\u201cCACR\u201d), which are administered by OFAC, which occurred due to an oversight in the activation of screening parameters for two customers located in Haiti and Belize. Upon discovery of these potential violations, EVERTEC Group initiated an internal review and submitted an initial notice of voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC on July 1, 2010. OFAC responded to this initial report with requests for additional information. EVERTEC Group provided the information requested on September 24, 2010 in its final notice of voluntary self-disclosure, which also included information on the remedial measures and new and enhanced internal controls adopted by EVERTEC Group to avoid this situation in the future. These potential violations involved a small number of processed transactions from Cuba compared to the overall number of transactions processed for these customers during the two-month period in which the screening failures occurred. We cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the OFAC review, the total costs to be incurred in response to this review, the potential impact on our personnel, the effect of implementing any further measures that may be necessary to ensure full compliance with U.S. sanctions regulations, or to what extent, if at all, we could be subject to penalties or other governmental investigations.\nSeparately, on September 15, 2010, EVERTEC Group submitted an initial notice of voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC regarding certain activities of its former Venezuelan subsidiary, EVERTEC de Venezuela, C.A. (which ceased being a subsidiary of EVERTEC Group after the closing of the Merger and is now known as Tarjetas y Transacciones en Red TRANRED, C.A. (\u201cTranred\u201d)) and EVERTEC Group\u2019s Costa Rican subsidiary (which continues to be a subsidiary of EVERTEC Group after the closing of the Merger). This initial self-disclosure informed OFAC that these subsidiaries appeared to have been involved in processing Cuba-related credit card transactions that EVERTEC Group and the subsidiary believed they could not reject under governing local law and policies, but which nevertheless may not be consistent with the CACR. With respect to EVERTEC Group and its former Venezuelan subsidiary, we disclosed that they completely ceased processing Cuba-related transactions for financial institutions operating in Venezuela on September 4, 2010. We also disclosed that EVERTEC Group\u2019s Costa Rican subsidiary completely ceased processing Cuba-related credit card transactions for financial institutions operating in Costa Rica in January 2009. In addition, it was also disclosed that EVERTEC Group\u2019s Costa Rican subsidiary\u2019s switch had served as a conduit through which information about Cuban-related debit card transactions was transmitted to credit card associations and issuer banks, which made the decisions to approve or reject the transactions.\nOn November 15, 2010, EVERTEC Group submitted its final notice of voluntary self-disclosure on these transactions to OFAC. The final report indicated the measures that we had taken to determine the amount of the credit transactions relating to Cuba that had not been rejected between 2007 and 2010. In addition, we confirmed that EVERTEC Group terminated the routing of the Cuban-related debit card transaction information through its Costa Rican subsidiary on September 30, 2010. While the credit and debit card transactions at issue represent a small proportion of the overall number of transactions processed for these financial institutions, the transactions occurred over an extended period of time.\nOn August 7, 2013, Popular submitted a voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC regarding certain routed debit card transactions by Tranred between October 2012 and May 2013 that may be in violation of the CACR. The voluntary self-disclosure also states that transactions constitute a small number of transactions compared to the overall number of transactions Tranred processed, and are representative of transactions that may have occurred prior to October 2010 when the entity was subject to the ownership and control of EVERTEC. We have been advised by Popular that effective May 2013, Tranred implemented a new control filter in its debit card transactions routing system to prevent the routing by Tranred of any debit card transaction originating in Cuba.\nShould OFAC determine that certain activities identified in the voluntary self-disclosures described above constituted violations of the CACR, civil or criminal penalties could be assessed against EVERTEC Group and/or its subsidiary. Since November 15, 2010, there have been no communications between OFAC and EVERTEC Group regarding the transactions included in the above described voluntary self-disclosures.\nPopular agreed to specific indemnification obligations with respect to all of the matters described above and certain other matters, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Merger Agreement and/or contained in the Venezuela Transition Services Agreement, dated September 29, 2010, as amended. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully collect any claims made with respect to such indemnities or that Popular and/or Tranred will satisfy its indemnification obligations to us.\nOur expansion and selective acquisition strategy exposes us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we evaluate opportunities for acquiring complementary businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable operations. Furthermore, for as long as we are deemed a \u201csubsidiary\u201d of a bank holding company for purposes of the BHC Act, we may conduct only activities authorized under the BHC Act and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation K and other related regulations for a bank holding company or a financial holding company. These restrictions may limit our ability to acquire other businesses or enter into other strategic transactions. See\nrisk factor \u201c-For purposes of the BHC Act, for as long as we are deemed to be controlled by Popular, we will be subject to supervision and examination by U.S. federal banking regulators, and our activities are limited to those permissible for Popular. Furthermore, as a technology service provider to regulated financial institutions, we are subject to additional regulatory oversight and examination. As a regulated institution, we may be required to obtain regulatory approval before engaging in certain new activities or businesses, whether organically or by acquisition.\u201d\nIn addition, in connection with any acquisitions, we must comply with U.S. federal and other antitrust and/or competition law requirements. Further, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company, which may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention and our financial and other resources. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. The failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights and defend ourselves from potential intellectual property infringement claims may diminish our competitive advantages or restrict us from delivering our services.\nOur trademarks, proprietary software, and other intellectual property, including technology/software licenses, are important to our future success. For example, the ATH trademark and trade name is widely recognized in Latin America and the Caribbean and is associated with quality and reliable service. Therefore, such marks represent substantial intangible assets and are important to our business. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to use such marks or a diminution in the perceived quality associated therewith could have an adverse impact on the growth of our businesses. We also rely on proprietary software and technology, including third party software that is used under licenses. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar software or technology, which would permit them to compete with us more efficiently. Furthermore, if any of the third party software or technology licenses are terminated or otherwise determined to be unenforceable, then we would have to obtain a comparable license, which may involve increased license fees and other costs.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary or confidential business know-how and other intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or misappropriate certain aspects of our services, infringe upon our rights, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing such unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is often very difficult, and therefore, we are unable to guarantee that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary software/technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be effective or enforceable in all instances. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our registrations and/or applications for trademarks, copyrights, and patents could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with maximum protection or meaningful advantage. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our software or technologies, we could lose competitive advantages and our businesses may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States or Puerto Rico. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings could prevent us from selling our services and products, or prevent us from preventing others from selling competing services, and may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our applications or services or third party applications upon which we rely are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties.\nAs our IT applications and services develop, we are increasingly subject to potential claims for intellectual property infringement, for example, patent or copyright infringement. Any such claims, even if lacking merit, could: (i) be expensive and time-consuming to defend; (ii) cause us to cease making, licensing or using software or applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; (iii) require us to redesign our software or applications, if feasible; (iv) divert management\u2019s attention and resources; and (v) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in us being restricted from delivering the related service and products, liable for damages, or otherwise result in a settlement that could be material to us.\nThe ability to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel is critical to our success and growth.\nAll of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. For us to successfully compete and grow, we must retain, recruit and develop the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital needs. In addition, we must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel in Puerto Rico is particularly challenging, given the poor state of the Puerto Rican economy. Our effort to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. We cannot assure you that key personnel, including executive officers, will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFailure to comply with U.S. state and federal antitrust requirements could adversely affect our business.\nDue to our ownership of the ATH network and our merchant acquiring and payment processing business in Puerto Rico, we are involved in a significant percentage of the debit and credit card transactions conducted in Puerto Rico each day. Regulatory scrutiny of, or regulatory enforcement action in connection with, compliance with U.S. state and federal antitrust requirements could potentially have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nThe market for our electronic commerce services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough for us to maintain and increase our profitability.\nIf the number of electronic commerce transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe future growth in the electronic commerce market will be driven by the cost, ease-of-use, and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses. In order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services.\nThe Department of Justice of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has announced that it has initiated an investigation into whether we have engaged in conduct that interferes with free competition in violation of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act\nThe Department of Justice of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico announced during a hearing before the Puerto Rico House of Representatives in February 2016 that it initiated a formal investigation into whether we have\nengaged in conduct that interferes with free competition with respect to the products and services we provide within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and which conduct could constitute a violation of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act, Law 77 of June 25, 1964. In March 2016 we received a formal request for information and documents from the Department of Justice which we responded to in a timely manner in May 2016. The request for information and documents, as well as our responses, are confidential.\nWe believe that the market for electronic processing services in Puerto Rico is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from large service providers and other competitors in each of the business segments within which we operate. The formal request for information and documents we received and responded to has not changed this belief, however there can be no assurance that the investigation will find that we have not engaged in any conduct that violates the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act. An adverse finding could lead to restrictions on our business, or our being required to take action, that has a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any such effect, or the perception by investors as to the likelihood of such an effect, could have a material negative effect on our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Structure, Governance and Stock Exchange Listing\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe have no direct operations or significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of the membership interest of Holdings, which in turn has no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the membership interest of EVERTEC Group. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in the senior secured credit facilities and other agreements which may govern future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans or enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or other obligations.\nAny declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock may be limited by restrictive covenants of our debt agreements, and will be at the sole discretion of our Board and will also depend on many factors.\nAny declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock may be limited by restrictive covenants of our debt agreements, and will be at the sole discretion of our Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board deems relevant. The terms of our senior secured credit facilities may restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We are prohibited from paying any cash dividend on our common stock unless we satisfy certain conditions. The senior secured credit facilities also include limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. Furthermore, we will be permitted under the terms of our debt agreements to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends. The agreements governing our current and future indebtedness may not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe requirements of having a class of publicly traded equity securities may strain our resources and distract management.\nUpon completion of our initial public offering in April 2013, we became subject to additional reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act effects comprehensive\nchanges to public company governance and disclosures in the United States and subjects us to additional federal regulation. Some of the regulation mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act has yet to be adopted or implemented. We cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how such regulations will impact the cost of compliance for a company with publicly traded common stock. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act and other new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. These new rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nWe are required to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, which could place a strain on our resources, and our failure to do so could require a restatement of our financials and lead to a potential default under our credit facility or a delisting from NYSE.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight is required. This may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report on our internal control over financial reporting in future years, investors may lose confidence in our financial reports and our stock price may decline. In addition, a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting could lead to the occurrence of material misstatements in our financial statements and we could be required to restate our financial results. Our failure to file timely and materially complete and accurate financial information in our reports with the SEC could lead to a number of adverse consequences, including a loss of confidence by our investors, a default under our credit facility, or a violation of NYSE\u2019s listing rules that could lead to our delisting. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on the trading price of our common stock.\nFor more information about a material weakness identified in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the ensuing restatement of our financial statements, please see Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements, and Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock or industry;\n\u2022\nmarket perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nmarket perception of the challenges of operating a company in Puerto Rico; and\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us, our stockholders, Popular or members of our management team.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings or otherwise, including financing acquisitions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 206,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 75,032,018 are outstanding as of January 31, 2016. All of these shares, other than the 11,654,803 shares held by Popular and the shares held by our officers and directors, are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act.\nIn addition, we have filed a Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering 12,089,382 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our Carib Holdings, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (or the 2010 Plan), and our EVERTEC, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive plan (or the 2013 Plan) and certain options and restricted stock granted outside of these plans (which we refer to as the Equity Plans), but subject to the terms and conditions of the 2010 Plan. Accordingly, shares of our common stock registered under such registration statement may become available for sale in the open market upon grants under the Equity Incentive Plans, subject to vesting restrictions, Rule 144 limitations applicable to our affiliates and the contractual lock-up provisions described below.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including any shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nIf securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that third party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. One or more analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. In addition, we may be unable or slow to attract research coverage. Alternatively, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe interests of Popular may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder.\nPopular has the right to nominate two members of our Board and, therefore, continues to be able to significantly influence our decisions. The interests of Popular could conflict with your interests as a holder of our common stock. For example, the concentration of ownership held by Popular, the terms of the Stockholder Agreement and our organizational documents (including Popular\u2019s quorum rights and consent rights over amendments to our bylaws) and Popular\u2019s right to terminate certain of its agreements with us in certain situations upon a change of control of EVERTEC Group, could delay, defer or prevent certain significant corporate actions that you as a stockholder may otherwise view favorably, including a change of control of us (whether by merger, takeover or other business combination). See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d for a description of the circumstances under which Popular may terminate certain of its agreements with us. A sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Popular could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur organizational documents and Stockholder Agreement may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and the Stockholder Agreement may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board and/or Popular. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na voting agreement pursuant to which Popular agreed to vote its shares in favor of the Popular director nominees (which, constitute the right to appoint two of our nine directors), directors nominated by a committee of our Board in accordance with the Stockholder Agreement and the management director and to remove and replace any such directors in accordance with the terms of the Stockholder Agreement and applicable law and an agreement by us to take all actions within our control necessary and desirable to cause the election, removal and replacement of such directors in accordance with the Stockholder Agreement and applicable law;\n\u2022\nrequiring that a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board (other than a reconvened meeting with the same agenda as the originally adjourned meeting) consist of (1) a majority of the total number of directors then serving on the Board and (2) at least one director nominated by Popular, for so long as it owns, together with its affiliates, 5% or more of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders other than Popular (as further described below);\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent unless the action is taken by unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings, which advance notice requirements are not applicable to any directors nominated in accordance with the terms of the Stockholder Agreement.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change in control of us. Our Board has authority to issue shares of preferred stock, subject to the approval of at least one director nominated by Popular for so long as it, together with its respective affiliates, owns at least 10% of our outstanding common stock. Our Board may issue preferred stock in one or more series, designate the number of shares constituting any series, and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of our preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares. In addition,\nPopular, under and subject to the Stockholder Agreement and our organizational documents, will retain significant influence over matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including the election of directors. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Related Party Transactions\u201d Together, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Stockholder Agreement could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant common stock owned by Popular and its individual right to nominate a specified number of directors in certain circumstances, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of us, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition. See \u201cDescription of Capital Stock-Certain Anti-Takeover, Limited Liability and Indemnification Provisions.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries still may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured. Although the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nIn addition to the $83 million which was available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015, the terms of the senior secured credit facilities enable us to increase the amount available under the term loan and/or revolving credit facilities if we are able to obtain loan commitments from banks and satisfy certain other conditions. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we face would increase.\nIf we are unable to comply with covenants in our debt instruments that limit our flexibility in operating our business, or obligate us to take action such as deliver financial reports, we may default under our debt instruments and our indebtedness may become due.\nThe agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. In addition, the\ncovenants in the senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and also limit our capital expenditures. In addition, we are required to comply with certain non-monetary covenants, including the timely delivery of financial statements that fairly present, in all material respects in accordance with GAAP, our financial condition and results of operation.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of our revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities. If the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, the proceeds from the sale or foreclosure upon such assets will first be used to repay debt under our senior secured credit facilities and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our unsecured indebtedness thereafter. As a result, our common stock could become worthless.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.", "PERMNO": 13837, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "EVTC"}
