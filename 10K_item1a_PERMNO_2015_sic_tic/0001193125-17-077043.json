{"cik": "1669792", "company": "AdvancePierre Foods Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth below. The selected risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or operating results. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in us. In addition, the order of the risks factors below should not be construed as indicative of their importance.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe food industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and our inability to compete successfully, or the effects of such competition, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe food industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Numerous brands and products compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily on product quality, total product portfolio, price, customer service, ability to meet customer demands, effective consumer marketing, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We compete with a significant number of companies of varying sizes, including a variety of regional and some national companies. Smaller players include CTI Foods, Devault Foods, Lopez Foods and JTM Food Group. In certain product categories such as ready-to-eat breakfast sandwiches and other entr\u00e9es and snacks, we compete with larger players such as Hormel, Tyson-Hillshire, Nestle and The J.M. Smucker Company. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, name recognition, R&D capabilities and resources than us and we may be unable to compete successfully with any or all of these companies. In addition, when competitors with nationally branded products focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label products becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose sales, which may require us to lower prices, increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, or increase marketing expenditures, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. In addition, any competitor could develop new or enhanced products that are superior to ours, increase their promotional spending or market and sell their products more successfully than we do. Our competitors could also offer lower prices to customers, which would potentially pressure us to lower prices to our customers. We may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough or sufficiently to successfully compete in such an environment.\nDisruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe use a variety of raw materials in our business. The primary raw materials used in our business are beef, poultry, pork, bread, breadings, cheese, eggs, seasonings, soy proteins, corn and packaging supplies. Damage or disruption to our raw material supply due to adverse weather conditions, climate change, crop conditions, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, changes in governmental agricultural programs, strikes, import restrictions, transportation interruptions, increases in diesel fuel costs, contamination with mold or bacteria, water shortage, industrial accidents and other occupational health and safety issues (including the outbreak of food-borne illnesses) or other events beyond our control could impair our ability to produce and sell our products. A disruption in our supply chain may also require significant resources to restore. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptions, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur top ten customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales.\nDuring Fiscal 2016, our top ten customers accounted for 58.2% of our net sales. In particular, our three largest customers, Sysco Corporation, U.S. Foods, Inc. and Walmart Stores, Inc. (including Sam\u2019s Club) accounted for 13.7%, 12.3%, and 10.8%, respectively, of our net sales in Fiscal 2016. While these Foodservice distributors distribute our products to many end-consumers, the size and importance of these customers may allow them to exert pressure on us with respect to pricing terms, product quality and the introduction of new products, which may result in reduced margins. In addition, if, for any reason, one of our key customers were to purchase significantly less of our products in the future or were to terminate its purchases from us, or if for any\nreason we were unable to renew an existing contract with a key customer on terms favorable to us, or at all, and we were not able to sell our products to new customers at comparable or greater levels, our business, financial condition and operating results would suffer.\nMost of our customers are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us.\nMost of our customers buy from us pursuant to individual purchase orders. Because such customers are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us, we cannot assure you that the volume or number of our customers\u2019 purchase orders will remain constant or increase or that we will be able to maintain our existing customer base. Significant decreases in the volume or number of our customers\u2019 purchase orders or our inability to retain or grow our current customer base may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIncreases in the prices of raw materials, particularly beef, poultry and pork, could reduce our operating margins.\nThe primary raw materials used in our business are beef, poultry, pork, bread, breadings, cheese, eggs, seasonings, soy proteins, corn and packaging supplies, with beef, poultry and pork comprising the majority of our raw material costs for Fiscal 2016. The supply and price of these raw materials are subject to market conditions and are influenced by other factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, unanticipated demand and damage or disruption to supply. Additionally, we typically do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers of beef, poultry and pork. Although our purchasing volume can sometimes provide an advantage when dealing with these suppliers, suppliers may not provide the products and supplies we need in the quantities and at the prices requested. While historically we have been able to pass along increases in the prices of raw materials to many of our customers, we may be unable to adjust the prices of our products to recover future increases in the prices of raw materials on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, some of our customers purchase products from us based on annually-renewed fixed price arrangements, which prevent us from recovering raw material price increases from these customers during the life of those contracts. For example, when we sell our products to schools, we enter into firm fixed price sales contracts for the entire school year. These sales contracts do not typically have indexed price escalation formulas to account for economic fluctuations and as a result, we typically are unable to pass along increases in costs due to economic fluctuations to these customers. If prices for our raw materials, including beef, poultry and pork, were to increase significantly without a similar increase in the price of our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nDeterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by changes in global or national economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Volatility in financial markets and deterioration of global or national economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results in a variety of ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers;\n\u2022\nconsumers may shift purchases to lower-priced offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns, such as food prepared away from home;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand by our customers may adversely affect our sales volume;\n\u2022\nvolatility in commodity and other input costs could adversely impact our operating results; and\n\u2022\nit may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us.\nChanges in consumer eating habits could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. For example, consumer eating habits could be affected by changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. If consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain of our products or develop and offer new products. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. Additionally, changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, may be costly and time-consuming.\nIf our products become contaminated or are mislabeled, we may be subject to product liability claims, product recalls and increased scrutiny by regulators, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur products are vulnerable to contamination by organisms that may produce food-borne illnesses. These organisms are generally found in the environment, and, as such, there is a risk that as a result of food processing they could be found in our products. For example, E. coli is one of many food-borne pathogens commonly associated with food products. Once contaminated products have been shipped for distribution, illness and death may result if the pathogens are not eliminated by processing at the Foodservice or consumer level. The risk can be reduced, but not eliminated, by use of good production practices and finished product testing. These risks are higher in raw or uncooked foods, which we also sell. Also, products purchased from others for re-packing or distribution may contain contaminants that we are unable to identify. We may also encounter the same risks if a third party tampers with our products or if our products are inadvertently mislabeled. We may need to recall our products if they become adulterated. For example, in July 2015, we issued voluntary recalls for certain frozen, raw, stuffed chicken entr\u00e9es from our Barber Foods product line due to a salmonella illness outbreak, which was epidemiologically linked to raw poultry that was supplied to us from a third-party supplier and which resulted in a product contamination insurance policy claim of $19.2 million. In addition, in April 2016, we issued a voluntary recall for 538 cases of fully-cooked breaded pork patties because we discovered, during a routine internal label review, that the finished product label had failed to include eggs, a known allergen, as one of the ingredients. Shipment of adulterated products, even if inadvertent, is a violation of law and may lead to product liability claims, product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdverse publicity about us and lack of confidence in our products based on alleged or actual reports of food-borne illnesses could negatively affect our reputation and affect our business.\nMaintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business. Anything that damages our reputation, or the public\u2019s confidence in our products, whether or not justified, including adverse publicity about the quality, safety or integrity of our products, could quickly affect our net sales and profits. Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses or harmful bacteria (such as E. coli, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, listeria or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering could severely harm our reputation or negatively affect the public\u2019s confidence in our products. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering or other concerns, even those unrelated to our products, may create adverse publicity which could adversely affect consumer demand and, as a result, our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe market our products under a variety of brand names. The termination of, or failure to renew, a license agreement under which we sell branded products, or the reduction in value of one of our owned brand names or an underlying license, could negatively impact our ability to produce and sell our products.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with the brand names under which our products are sold. We rely on copyright and trademark law to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, such as our brand names. We may be required from time to time to bring lawsuits against third parties to protect our intellectual property. Similarly, from time to time, we may be party to proceedings in which third parties challenge our rights. Any lawsuits or other actions we bring to enforce our rights may not be successful, and we may in fact be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. In addition to our own brand names, we have licenses or production agreements with third parties that own trademarks or trade names used in the marketing of some of our products. In the event that any such license or production agreement is terminated, we may lose the right to use, or have reduced rights to use, the intellectual property covered by such agreement. In such event, we might not be able to secure licenses to use alternative brand names or trade names in the marketing of our products, and our products may not be as attractive to customers. We may also sell certain assets, including brand names, from time to time in the ordinary course of business. In addition, certain events, including events beyond our control, could make certain of our brand names, or the brand names we license, less attractive to our customers, making our products less desirable as a result. Any loss in the value of a brand name or loss of a license for a brand name could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations, which require significant compliance expenditures.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations. Our food processing facilities and products are subject to frequent inspection by the USDA, the FDA and various state and local health and agricultural agencies. Applicable statutes and regulations governing food products include rules for labeling the content of specific types of foods, the nutritional value of that food and its serving size, as well as rules that protect against contamination of products by food-borne pathogens. Many jurisdictions also provide that food producers adhere to good production practices (the definition of which may vary by jurisdiction) with respect to production processes. Recently, the food safety practices and procedures in the meat processing industry have been subject to more intense scrutiny and oversight by the USDA and future outbreaks of diseases among cattle, poultry or pigs could lead to further governmental regulation. In addition, our production facilities and distribution centers are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and workplace health. Failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, product recalls or seizures and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, compliance with current or future laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe failure to comply with our government contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things, fines or other liabilities, and changes in procurement regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSales to governmental departments and agencies, including schools, through various contracts, are highly regulated. Noncompliance with contract provisions, government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations could result in civil, criminal and administrative liability, including substantial monetary fines or damages, termination of government contracts or other customer contracts, and suspension, debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public segment. In addition, government contracts are generally terminable at any time if it is convenient for the contracting agency to do so or upon default. The effect of any of these possible actions by any governmental department or agency could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nLabor disruptions or increased labor costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,500 employees. Prior to the acquisition of Allied in October 2016, none of our employees were unionized. Allied, a subsidiary which we acquired in October 2016, has approximately 90 unionized employees. The collective bargaining agreement covering these employees expires in April 2020. If we are unable to extend or renew this collective bargaining agreement on satisfactory terms, or at all, it could disrupt our operations. In addition, there have been, from time to time, union organization attempts at our other facilities, and if a more significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, it could adversely affect productivity, increase labor costs and increase the risk of work stoppages at our facilities. Though we believe that we have good relationships with all of our employees, if a work stoppage were to occur, it could interfere with our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe sell a large percentage of our products to schools, directly and through distributors, which subjects our sales volumes and, thus, our operating results, to seasonal variations.\nOur quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonal fluctuations of our sales and operating income. We derived 16.3% of our consolidated net sales and 30.2% of our Foodservice segment net sales in Fiscal 2016 from schools. Because schools comprise a significant portion of our customer base, sales of our products tend to be lower during the summer months. These lower sales volumes negatively impact our operating profits during the third quarter of each fiscal year. As a result of these fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our net sales and operating income among different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that they cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. In the future, federal and state funding for school lunches may decrease due to budget cuts and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that schools will continue to purchase products, directly from us or from our distributors, at current levels, if at all.\nAny disruption of operations at one or more of our production facilities or distribution centers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur production and distribution network consists of eleven production facilities and three strategically-located distribution centers in the US. We are also in the process of building a new 70,000 square foot production facility in Vineland, New Jersey, which we expect to complete by April 1, 2017. Any disruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of these facilities, even on a short-term basis, could delay or postpone production or distribution of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Such disruption could be caused by a number of different events, including:\n\u2022\nmaintenance outages;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\nwidespread contamination of our equipment;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters; or\n\u2022\nother events beyond our control.\nAny material malfunction or prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our facilities could prevent us from fulfilling orders to existing customers, and could limit our ability to sell products to new customers. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSignificant increases in the cost of distribution could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur distribution costs include fuel for transportation and electricity for cold storage. Significant increases in these distribution costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We use a core group of contract carriers with whom we have established certain rates based on mileage to certain regions or states. A fuel surcharge addendum is a component of all such rate agreements, to offset the fluctuating price of diesel fuel, primarily to limit the contract carrier\u2019s exposure. If these surcharges rise significantly and we do not have effective hedges in place, or if we are unable to pass increased distribution costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition to in-house cold storage, we use commercial cold storage vendors to store our finished goods. A major component of cold storage operations expense is electricity cost. Though we try to minimize storage costs, any significant increase in electricity rates for the vendor are passed along to us in the form of higher storage rates. If our storage rates or electricity rates for in-house cold storage increase significantly, we may be unable to pass these costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unsuccessful at integrating recent or future acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we opportunistically pursue acquisitions to diversify our products, add production capabilities, expand production capacity and allow for meaningful synergy realization. If we are unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquired businesses, or to realize anticipated cost savings, sales enhancements or other synergies, in a timely manner, our profitability could be adversely affected. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise and we may be unable to retain the loyalty and business of the customers of the acquired business. A significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational resources. Additionally, we may be unable to retain qualified management and other key personnel employed by acquired companies for different reasons, including reasons related to difficulties assimilating different corporate cultures and business practices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from any recent or future acquisitions.\nWe may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings or may incur additional or unexpected costs in our cost savings efforts.\nAs part of the APF Way, we initially focused on reducing our historically high cost structure by executing on productivity programs and re-aligning trade promotion allowances, resulting in approximately $157.0 million in implemented annualized savings between 2013 and December 31, 2016. We are also currently implementing\nmultiple incremental savings opportunities, across the areas of production, procurement, commercial and logistics, that we expect will deliver continuous productivity savings and help us effectively manage margins and profitability. However, cost savings expectations can only be estimated, are difficult to predict and are, by nature, speculative. As a result, we can provide no assurances that we will achieve any of our expected cost savings. A variety of factors could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected cost savings, including, among others, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to the APF Way, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time and unexpected costs associated with operating our business. We may be unable to realize all of these cost savings within the expected timeframe, or at all, and we may incur additional or unexpected costs in our cost savings efforts. Our cost savings estimates are also based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are in turn based on our analysis of the various factors which currently, and could in the future, impact our business. These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, including, among others, our anticipated business strategies, our marketing strategies, our product development and licensing strategies, our ability to anticipate and react to business trends, general economic conditions and other developments in our industry. The actual results of implementing the various cost savings programs may differ materially from our current estimates if any of these assumptions prove incorrect. Moreover, our continued efforts to implement the cost savings programs may divert management attention from the rest of our business and may preclude us from seeking attractive new product opportunities or pursuing other programs, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change and climate change regulation.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters or other effects that are impossible to predict. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns could limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities. For example, in 2012, the lack of adequate rainfall across more than half of the US resulted in increased feed costs which impacted the price of meat domestically. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. International, federal, regional, state and local efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions are at various stages of consideration and implementation, and could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs. In addition, consumer concern about animal-based agriculture contributing to climate change could adversely affect demand for our products.\nWe are required to pay our pre-IPO owners for certain tax benefits, which amounts are expected to be material.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into an income tax receivable agreement (\u201cTRA\u201d) with our pre-IPO stockholders that requires us to pay them 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in US federal, state, local and foreign income tax that we and our subsidiaries actually realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination by us, a change of control or certain subsidiary dispositions) as a result of the utilization of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 net operating losses, tax basis and certain other tax attributes attributable to periods prior to our IPO together with interest accrued at a rate of LIBOR plus 2% from the date the applicable tax return is due (without extension) until the date the applicable payment is due.\nThe payments that we may make under the TRA could be material. Assuming no material changes in relevant tax law, and that we and our subsidiaries earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the TRA, we expect that future payments under the TRA will total approximately $254.2 million, and accordingly, on July 20, 2016, the effective date of the TRA, we recorded an initial obligation of approximately $254.2 million. We expect to make the first payment in the fourth quarter of 2017. The timing and amount of payments will depend on our annual pre-tax income. We estimate that the first payment will be approximately\n$35.8 million plus interest at LIBOR plus 2% for the period April 17, 2017 through the date of payment. We expect to pay approximately half of the estimated value of the TRA payments in the first four years (2017-2020) and the balance between 2021 and 2055.\nThese payment obligations are our obligations and not obligations of our subsidiaries. The actual amount and utilization of net operating losses, tax basis and other tax attributes, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 taxable income in the future. Our counterparties under the TRA will not reimburse us for any benefits that are subsequently disallowed (although any future payments would be adjusted to the extent possible to reflect the result of such disallowance). As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments under the TRA that are greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nIf we undergo a change of control as defined in the TRA, the TRA will terminate and we will be required to make a lump sum payment equal to the present value of expected future payments under the TRA, which payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 future taxable income. Additionally, if we or a direct or indirect subsidiary transfers any asset to a corporation with which we do not file a consolidated tax return, we will be treated as having sold that asset for its fair market value in a taxable transaction for purposes of determining the cash savings in income tax under the TRA. If we sell or otherwise dispose of any of our subsidiaries in a transaction that is not a change of control, we will be required to make a payment equal to the present value of future payments under the TRA attributable to the tax benefits of such subsidiary that is sold or disposed of, applying the assumptions described above. Any such payment resulting from a change of control, asset transfer or subsidiary disposition could be substantial and could exceed our actual cash tax savings.\nOur high level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our floating-rate indebtedness and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $1.1 billion in principal indebtedness and $119.6 million of additional borrowings available under an asset-based revolving credit facility (\u201cABL facility\u201d), after giving effect to $5.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our current level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and future business opportunities, or to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including certain borrowings under our credit facilities, bear interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to comply with our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, any failure of which could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations, working capital, capital expenditures, product development, acquisitions, debt service requirements and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting the payment of dividends; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nIn addition, if we are unable to service our high level of indebtedness, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. Our failure to make the required interest and principal payments on our indebtedness would result in an event of default under the agreement governing such indebtedness, which may result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nAlthough our credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial, thereby exacerbating the risks associated with our high level of indebtedness.\nWe expect to continue paying regular dividends to our stockholders, but our ability to do so is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our financial condition, our credit facilities and Laws in the state of Delaware.\nWe paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.14 per share in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2016 (September 28, 2016 and December 6, 2016) and declared a dividend on February 16, 2017 of $0.16 per share for first quarter 2017, which was paid on March 6, 2017. The dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects an increase of 14.3% and we expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends of at least $0.16 per share. However, the payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors, who may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on many factors, including, among others, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In particular, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by covenants in our credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes and may be further restricted by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends also depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Furthermore, Delaware law requires that our board of directors determine whether we have adequate surplus prior to the declaration of dividends. While we do not currently believe that these restrictions will impair our ability to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, there can be no assurance that we will not need to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our common stock in the future.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our pre-IPO stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2016, we had 78,630,046 shares of common stock outstanding (including 551,511 unvested restricted stock awards), of which 21,437,000 were freely transferable and freely tradable on the NYSE, at that date, without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). On January 24, 2017, we completed a secondary public offering in which certain funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cOaktree\u201d) and members of our\nmanagement sold 14,375,000 shares of common stock. Accordingly at January 24, 2017, 35,812,000 shares of common stock were freely transferable and freely tradable on the NYSE without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act except that any shares held by our affiliates (as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d)), including funds managed by Oaktree and our directors and executive officers may be sold if certain requirements are met. The remaining shares, representing 54.4% of our total outstanding shares of common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144.\nWe have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock issued or issuable under our 2009 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. We could also make equity compensation grants outside of our 2009 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. Accordingly, shares registered under our registration statement on Form S-8 can be sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates and vesting restrictions. Our registration statement on Form S-8 covers 6,500,000 shares of common stock.\nIn addition, pursuant to our amended and restated registration rights agreement, we have granted to the funds owned by Oaktree an unlimited number of \u201cdemand\u201d registration rights and to both the funds managed by Oaktree and the other pre-IPO stockholders party thereto customary \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, our pre-IPO stockholders could cause the prevailing market price of our common stock to decline. The shares covered by our amended and restated registration rights agreement represented 48.2% of our outstanding common stock at March 1, 2017. Registration of any of these outstanding shares of common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the applicable registration statement.\nAs restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nAs a result of the completion of a secondary public offering on January 24, 2017, we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE. However, we will continue to qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies during a one-year transition period.\nBecause funds managed by Oaktree no longer control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE.\nHowever, we will continue to qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies, during a one-year transition period from January 24, 2017. The NYSE rules will require that we (1) have a board of directors that is composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of the NYSE, within one year of the date we ceased to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d (2) have a compensation committee that consists of a majority of independent directors within 90 days of the date we ceased to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d and, within one year of the date we ceased to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d a compensation committee that consists entirely of independent directors, and (3) have a nominating and corporate governance committee that consists of a majority of independent directors within 90 days of the date we ceased to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d and, within one year of the date we ceased to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d have a nominating and corporate governance committee that consists entirely of independent directors. During these transition periods, we may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, as permitted by the NYSE rules. Accordingly, our stockholders do not currently have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nIn addition, on June 20, 2012, the SEC adopted Rule 10C-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) pertaining to compensation committee independence and the role and disclosure of compensation consultants and other advisers to the compensation committee. The NYSE has since adopted amendments to its existing listing standards to comply with the provisions of Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act, and on January 11, 2013, the SEC approved such amendments. The amended listing standards require, among others, that:\n\u2022\ncompensation committees be composed of fully independent directors, as determined pursuant to new and existing independence requirements;\n\u2022\ncompensation committees be explicitly charged with hiring and overseeing compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisers; and\n\u2022\ncompensation committees be required to consider, when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisers, certain independence factors, including factors that examine the relationship between the consultant or adviser\u2019s employer and us.\nWe will not be subject to these compensation committee independence requirements until the end of the one-year transition period after we ceased being a controlled company.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs, and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of being a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance matters, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs of recruiting and retaining non-executive directors. We have also incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and related rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE. These rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. For example, these laws and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Our management and other personnel have devoted, and will continue to devote, a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. We may also need to hire more employees, such as additional accounting or internal audit staff, in the future to comply with the requirements of being a public company, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would increase our costs and expenses.", "PERMNO": 16149, "SIC": 2000, "TIC": "APFH"}
