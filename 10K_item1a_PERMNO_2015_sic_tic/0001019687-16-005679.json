{"cik": "1355848", "company": "Genius Brands International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on Page of this Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Company\u2019s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have incurred net losses since inception.\nThe Company has a history of operating losses and incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since its inception. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated net revenues of $907,983 and incurred a net loss of $3,483,122, while for the previous year, the Company generated net revenue of $925,788 and incurred a net loss of $3,728,599. These losses, among other things, have had an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, stockholders\u2019 equity, net current assets and working capital.\nThe Company will need to generate additional revenue to achieve profitability. The Company has already achieved significant cost savings and is beginning to generate revenues derived from its existing properties, properties in production, new brands being introduced into the marketplace, the re-launch of Baby Genius, and incremental revenue derived from the licensing business it manages on behalf of its clients. However, the ability to sustain these revenues and generate significant additional revenues or achieve profitability will depend upon numerous factors some of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control.\nWe will need additional capital to fund our growing operations. If we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may then be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nWe expect that as our business continues to grow we will need additional working capital. While we believe that we will be able to fund our business through operating cash flows generated though our enhanced business model these cash flows are less than anticipated or do not come to fruition in the time horizon we anticipate, we would require additional debt and /or equity financing to sustain our operations. If adequate additional debt and/or equity financing is not available on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to expand our business, and we will have to modify our business plans accordingly. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and our financial condition.\nIf we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue as a going concern, we could be forced to cease our activities and dissolve the Company. In such an event, we will need to satisfy various creditors and other claimants, severance, lease termination and other dissolution-related obligations.\nOur ability to raise financing through sales of equity securities depends on general market conditions and the demand for our common stock. We may be unable to raise adequate capital through sales of equity securities, and if our stock has a low market price at the time of such sales, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. If adequate financing is not available or unavailable on acceptable terms, we may find we are unable to fund expansion, continue offering products and services, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or products, or to respond to competitive pressures in the industry which may jeopardize our ability to continue operations.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period.\nCash flow and projections for any entertainment company producing original content can be expected to fluctuate until the animated content and ancillary consumer products are in the market and could fluctuate thereafter even when the content and products are in the marketplace. There is significant lead time in developing and producing animated content before that content is in the marketplace. Unanticipated delays in entertainment production can delay the release of the content into the marketplace. Structured retail windows that dictate when new products can be introduced at retail are also out of the Company\u2019s control. While the Company believes it has mitigated this in part by creating a slate of properties at various stages of development or production as well as representing certain established brands which contribute immediately to cash flow, any delays in the production and release of our content and products or any changes in the preferences of our customers could result in lower than anticipated cash flows.\nAs with our cash flows, our revenues and results of operations depend significantly upon the appeal of our content to our customers, the timing of releases of our products and the commercial success of our products, none of which can be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. The results of one period may not be indicative of the results of any future period. Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nProduction cost will be amortized according to the individual film forecasting methodology. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue, we would be required to adjust amortization of related production costs. These adjustments would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the United States, global or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nA decrease in economic activity in the United States or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. A decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for and sales of our products. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the animated content and consumer products we offer, which could also decrease our revenues, increase our costs, or both.\nInaccurately anticipating changes and trends in popular culture, media and movies, fashion, or technology can negatively affect our sales.\nWhile trends in the toddler to tween sector change quickly, we respond to trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending, and expanding our product offerings on an on-going basis. However, we operate in extremely competitive industries where the ultimate appeal and popularity of content and products targeted to this sector can be difficult to predict. We believe our focus on \u201ccontent and products with a purpose\u201d serves an underrepresented area of the toddler to tween market; however, if the interest of our audience trends away from our current properties toward other offerings based on current media, movies, animated content or characters, and if we fail to accurately anticipate trends in popular culture, movies, media, fashion, or technology, our products may not be accepted by children, parents, or families and our revenues, profitability, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from a variety of retailers that sell similar merchandise and have better resources than we do.\nThe industries in which we operate are competitive, and our results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, competitive pricing, promotional pressures, additional competitor offerings and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Indirectly through our licensing arrangements, we compete for retailers as well as other outlets for the sale and promotion of our licensed merchandise. Our primary competition comes from competitors such as The Walt Disney Company, Nickelodeon Studios, and the Cartoon Network.\nThe Company has sought a competitive advantage by providing \u201ccontent and products with a purpose\u201d which are both entertaining and enriching for children and offer differentiated value that parents seek in making purchasing decisions for their children. While we do not believe that this value proposition is specifically offered by our competitors, our competitors have greater financial resources and more developed marketing channels than we do which could impact the Company\u2019s ability, through its licensees, to secure shelf space thereby decreasing our revenues or affecting our profitability and results of operations.\nThe production of our animated content is accomplished through third-party production and animation studios around the world, and any failure of these third-parties could negatively impact our business.\nAs part of our business model to manage cash flows, we have partnered with a number of third-party production and animation studios around the world for the production of our new content in which these partners fund the production of the content in exchange for a portion of revenues generated in certain territories. We are reliant on our partners to produce and deliver the content on a timely basis meeting the predetermined specifications for that product. The delivery of inferior content could result in additional expenditures by us to correct any problems to ensure marketability. Further, delays in the delivery of the finished content to us could result in the Company failing to deliver the product to broadcasters to which it has been pre-licensed. While we believe we have mitigated this risk by aligning the economic interests of our partners with ours and managing the production process remotely on a daily basis, any failures or delays from our production partners could negatively affect our profitability.\nIf we fail to honor our obligations under the terms of our third party supply agreements, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn early 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive 3-year arrangement with Sony DADC US Inc. which gives Sony the right to fulfill the Company\u2019s DVD and CD duplication requirements for its product. In consideration for these exclusive rights the Company received an initial marketing support payment of $750,000 with an additional $750,000 paid in February 2015. Sony will recoup the marketing support payment through a premium on the physical media unit costs. The Company is obligated to repay a pro-rata portion of the marketing support payment if the Company does not order a minimum number of DVD/CD units during the term. However, while the Company believes the minimum order threshold is achievable over the term based on its existing properties and properties currently in production or in development, if it does not meet the minimum order threshold it would be obligated to repay any outstanding balances in 2017 and to do so may require it to divert funds from operations which may have a material adverse effect on its business.\nFailure to successfully market or advertise our products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell products is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If we or our licensees do not successfully market our products or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe failure of others to promote our products may adversely affect our business.\nThe availability of retailer programs relating to product placement, co-op advertising and market development funds, and our ability and willingness to pay for such programs, are important with respect to promoting our properties. In addition, although we may have agreements for the advertising and promotion of our products through our licensees, we will not be in direct control of those marketing efforts and those efforts may not be done in a manner that will maximize sales of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological advances.\nThe entertainment industry in general, and the music and motion picture industries in particular, continue to undergo significant changes, primarily due to technological developments. Because of the rapid growth of technology, shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment, it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on potential revenue from, and profitability of, distributing entertainment programming. As it is also impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on our ability to compete effectively in a changing market, if we are not able to keep pace with these technological advances, our revenues, profitability and results from operations may be materially adversely affected.\nLoss of key personnel may adversely affect our business.\nOur success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management team, including Andrew Heyward, our Chief Executive Officer and Amy Moynihan Heyward, our President. The loss of the services of any member of our core executive management team or other key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management team currently owns a substantial interest in our voting stock.\nOur management team and Board of Directors own or control a combined 3,483,219, or 30.77%, of the 11,319,450 shares currently outstanding. Sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, management has the ability to control any proposals submitted to shareholders, including corporate actions and board changes which may not be in accordance with the votes of other shareholders.\nLitigation may harm our business or otherwise distract management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and could distract management. For example, lawsuits by licensors, consumers, employees or stockholders could be very costly and disrupt business. While disputes from time to time are not uncommon, we may not be able to resolve such disputes on terms favorable to us.\nOur vendors and licensees may be subject to various laws and government regulations, violation of which could subject these parties to sanctions which could lead to increased costs or the interruption of normal business operations that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur vendors and licensees may operate in a highly regulated environment in the US and international markets. Federal, state and local governmental entities and foreign governments may regulate aspects of their businesses, including the production or distribution of our content or products. These regulations may include accounting standards, taxation requirements (including changes in applicable income tax rates, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations), product safety and other safety standards, trade restrictions, regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations, advertising directed toward children, product content, and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. While we believe our vendors and licensees take all the steps necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that they are compliant or will be in compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could increase our costs or decrease our revenue resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete in the animated content and entertainment industry depends, in part, upon successful protection of our proprietary and intellectual property. We protect our property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable companies in specific territories and media for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited, or no, practical protection in some jurisdictions. It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or portions of our productions. In addition, although we own most of the music and intellectual property included in our products, there are some titles which the music or other elements are in the public domain and for which it is difficult or even impossible to determine whether anyone has obtained ownership or royalty rights. It is an inherent risk in our industry that people may make such claims with respect to any title already included in our products, whether or not such claims can be substantiated. If litigation is necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the resulting diversion of resources could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nTrading in our common stock can fluctuate significantly and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will either develop or be maintained. Our common stock is expected to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This trading activity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that our stock price will decline in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants or the stock market as a whole. We can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or that our stock price will fluctuate in a manner that is consistent with our operating results.\nIf our common stock remains subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nUnless our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, including the Nasdaq Capital Market or we have stockholders\u2019 equity of $5,000,000 or more and our common stock has a market price per share of more than $4.00, transactions in our common stock will be subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. If our common stock remains subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nIn accordance with these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document that describes the risks associated with such stocks, the broker-dealer's duties in selling the stock, the customer's rights and remedies and certain market and other information. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must make a suitability determination approving the customer for low-priced stock transactions based on the customer's financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing to the customer, obtain specific written consent from the customer, and provide monthly account statements to the customer. The effect of these restrictions will probably decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, decrease liquidity of our common stock and increase transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common stock as compared to other securities. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.\nAs a result, if our common stock continues to be subject to the penny stock rules, the market price of our securities may be depressed, and you may find it more difficult to sell our securities.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require an annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue \"blank check\" preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our Company to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. Any additional preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of common stock, which could dilute the value of common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price, if any, of our common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, as amended, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information and notice requirements. Of the approximately 11,259,450 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, approximately 3,444,850 shares are freely tradable without restriction. Any substantial sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. Our current intention is to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts. There can be no assurance that we will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock, and in any event, a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of the our Board of Directors. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because the return on investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 16463, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "GNUS"}
