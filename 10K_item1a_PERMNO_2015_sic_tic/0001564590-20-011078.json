{"cik": "1499453", "company": "Spirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe conduct our operations exclusively in Texas, specifically in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Bryan/College Station, San Antonio-New Braunfels and Tyler metropolitan areas and North Central Texas, which imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting its Texas markets, including any downturn in the energy, technology or real estate sectors.\nWe conduct our operations exclusively in Texas, specifically in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Bryan/College Station, San Antonio-New Braunfels and Tyler metropolitan areas and North Central Texas, and, as of December 31, 2019, the substantial majority of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in our Texas markets. Likewise, as of such date, the substantial majority of our secured loans were secured by collateral located in Texas. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in Texas significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, and any adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of non-performing assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects our Texas markets, its existing or prospective borrowers or property values in its market areas may affect us and its profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically focused.\nThe economies in our markets are also highly dependent on the energy sector as well as the technology and real estate sectors. In particular, a decline in or volatility of the prices of crude oil or natural gas could adversely affect many of our customers. Any downturn or adverse development in its Texas markets, including as a result of a downturn in the energy, technology or real estate sectors result in the following consequences:\n\u2022\nincreases in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nincreases in non-performing assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\ndecreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position; and\n\u2022\ndecreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability,\nwhich, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.\nOur strategy focuses on organic growth and acquisitions. We may not be able to execute on aspects of our growth strategy to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, we may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of acquisitions. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect our growth. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to adapt our existing credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to implement one or more aspects of our strategy, we may be unable to maintain our historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a strategy that includes acquisitions. An acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nfinding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022\nattracting funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances;\n\u2022\nmaintaining asset quality;\n\u2022\nretaining customers and key personnel;\n\u2022\nobtaining necessary regulatory approvals, which we may have difficulty obtaining or be unable to obtain;\n\u2022\nconducting adequate due diligence and managing known and unknown risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022\nintegrating acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition candidates that fit our strategy and standards. We face significant competition in pursuing acquisition targets from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater financial, human, technical and other resources than we do. Our ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial resources to fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have and the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, such as unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire or successfully eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations in a timely manner may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, acquisitions in Texas typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and earnings per share may occur in connection with any future acquisition, and the carrying amount of any goodwill that we currently maintain or may acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nSBA lending is an important part of our business. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government and our status as a participant in the SBA\u2019s Preferred Lenders Program, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans and selling the guaranteed portion thereof.\nWe have been approved by the SBA to participate in the SBA\u2019s Preferred Lenders Program. As an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender\u2019s Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in both premium income for us at the time of sale, and created a stream of future servicing income. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue originating these loans, that a secondary market for these loans will continue to exist or that we will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans. When we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on the non-guaranteed portion of a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA.\nThe laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to SBA loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, especially our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to SBA loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. In addition, the aggregate amount of SBA 7(a) and 504 loan guarantees by the SBA must be approved each fiscal year by the federal government. We cannot predict the amount of SBA 7(a) loan guarantees in any given fiscal year. If the federal government were to reduce the amount of SBA loan guarantees, such reduction could adversely impact our SBA lending program, including making and selling the guaranteed portion of fewer SBA 7(a) and 504 loans. In addition, any default by the U.S. government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could, among other things, impede our ability to originate SBA or U.S. Department of Agriculture loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe SBA may not honor its guarantees if we do not originate loans in compliance with SBA guidelines.\nAs of December 31, 2019, SBA 7(a) and 504 program loans of $74.2 million comprised 4.2% of our loan portfolio and we intend to grow this segment of our portfolio in the future. SBA lending programs typically guarantee 75.0% of the principal on an underlying loan. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us notwithstanding that a portion of the loan was guaranteed by the SBA, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we follow the SBA\u2019s underwriting guidelines, our ability to do so depends on the knowledge and diligence of our employees and the effectiveness of controls we have established. If our employees do not follow the SBA guidelines in originating loans and if our loan review and audit programs fail to identify and rectify such failures, the SBA may reduce or, in some cases, refuse to honor its guarantee obligations and we may incur losses as a result.\nLoans to and deposits from foreign nationals are an important part of our business and we face specific risks associated with foreign nationals.\nAs of December 31, 2019, loans to foreign nationals of $134.0 million comprised 7.6% of our loan portfolio and deposits from foreign nationals of $19.9 million comprised 1.0% of our total deposits. We define foreign nationals as those who derive more than 50.0% of their personal income from non-U.S. sources. We intend to grow this segment of its loan and deposit portfolio in the future. These borrowers typically lack a U.S. credit history and have a potential to leave the United States without fulfilling their mortgage obligation and leaving us with little recourse to them personally. Additionally, transactions with foreign nationals place additional pressure on our policies, procedures and systems for complying with the Bank Secrecy Act and other AML statutes and regulations.\nOur ability to develop bankers, retain bankers and recruit additional successful bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur ability to retain and grow our loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and relationship management skills of our bankers, many of whom we develop internally. If we lose the services of any of our bankers, including successful bankers employed by financial institutions that we may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, or fail to successfully develop bankers internally, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. Our growth strategy also relies on our ability to attract and retain additional profitable bankers. We may face difficulties in recruiting and retaining bankers of our desired caliber due to competition from other financial institutions. In particular, many of our competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources, and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Additionally, we may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before it is able to determine whether a new banker will be profitable or effective. If we are unable to develop, attract or retain successful bankers, or if our bankers fail to meet our expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, we may be unable to execute our business strategy and our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be adversely affected.\nGreater seasoning of our loan portfolio could expose us to increased credit risks.\nThe business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal of or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. Our loan portfolio has grown to $1.77 billion as of December 31, 2019, from $1.09 billion as of December 31, 2018, and $869.1 million as of December 31, 2017. It is difficult to assess the future performance of acquired or recently originated loans because our relatively limited experience with such loans does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to judge future collectability. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe small- to medium-sized businesses to which we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small- to medium-sized businesses, which we define as commercial borrowing relationships with customers with revenues of $3.0 million to $30.0 million. Small- to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact our primary service areas specifically or Texas generally and small- to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings may be affected.\nWe establish our allowance for loan and lease losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on our analysis of our loan portfolio and market environment. Management maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses based upon, among other things, (i) historical experience, (ii) an evaluation of local, regional and national economic conditions, (iii) regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality, (iv) current trends regarding the volume and severity of past due and problem loans, (v) the existence and effect of concentrations of credit and (vi) results of regulatory examinations. Based on such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the respective loan portfolios. Although we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate, there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future losses. Future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ or adverse developments arise with respect to nonperforming or performing loans. Material additions to the allowances for loan losses would result in a decrease in our net income and our capital balance. The amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan and lease losses was $6.7 million, which represents 0.38% of our loans held for investment and 104.18% of our total nonperforming loans. Loans acquired are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan and lease losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have previously experienced. We may be required to take additional provisions for loan and lease losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan and lease losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or requirements by our banking regulators. In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to recognize future charge-offs. These adjustments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the FASB, decided to review how banks estimate losses in the allowance calculation, and it issued the final current expected credit loss standard (\u201cCECL\u201d) in June 2016. Currently, the impairment model is based on incurred losses, and investments are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the new CECL model that will become effective for us, as an emerging growth company, for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Under the new CECL model, financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters.\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of these changes to our financial position and results of operations. The allowance is a material estimate of ours, and given the change from an incurred loss model to a methodology that considers the credit loss over the life of the loan, there is the potential for an increase in the allowance at adoption date. We anticipate a significant change in the processes and procedures to calculate the allowance, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. We expect to continue developing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure we are fully compliant with the CECL requirements at its adoption date.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans secured by receivables, promissory notes, inventory, equipment or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $282.9 million, or 16.0% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of commercial loans to businesses. In general, these loans are collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, promissory notes, inventory and equipment and most are backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. These commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate exposing us to increased credit risk. A portion of our commercial loans are secured by promissory notes that evidence loans made by us to borrowers that in turn make loans to others that are secured by real estate. Accordingly, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of the collateral securing these loans. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of 1-4 single family residential real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $375.7 million, or 21.3% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of loans with 1-4 single family residential real estate as a primary component of collateral. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in Texas, particularly in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Bryan/College Station, San Antonio-New Braunfels and Tyler metropolitan areas and North Central Texas, could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Real estate values in many Texas markets have experienced periods of fluctuation over the last five years. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio and could result in losses that adversely affect our credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial real estate and construction, land and development loan portfolios expose us to credit risks that could be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $753.8 million, or 42.7% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans) and $259.4 million, or 14.7% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of construction, land and development loans. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate due to the fluctuation of real estate values. Additionally, nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which would reduce our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConstruction, land and development loans also involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are secured by a project under construction and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. It can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project, and this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary markets are susceptible to severe weather events that could negatively impact the economies of our markets, our operations or our customers, any of which impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTornadoes, droughts, wildfires, flooding, hurricanes, hailstorms, damaging winds, tropical storms and other natural disasters and severe weather events can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operations, cause widespread property damage and have the potential to significantly depress the local economies in which we operate. We operate banking locations in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth Bryan/College Station, San Antonio-New Braunfels and Tyler metropolitan areas and North Central Texas, which are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms and other natural disasters and severe weather conditions. For example, in late August 2017, Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall on the Texas gulf coast, caused extensive and costly damage across Southeast Texas. As of December 31, 2019, the storm did not have a material impact on the markets in which we operate, including any adverse impact on our customers and our loan and deposit activities and credit exposures.\nFuture severe weather events in our markets could potentially result in extensive and costly property damage to businesses and residences, force the relocation of residents and significantly disrupt economic activity in our markets. We cannot predict the extent of damage that may result from such severe weather events, which will depend on a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the severity and duration of the event, the timing and level of government responsiveness and the pace of economic recovery. If the economies in our primary markets experience an overall decline as a result of a catastrophic event, demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on our loan portfolios may increase substantially after events such as hurricanes, as uninsured property losses, interruptions of our customers\u2019 operations or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans could be materially and adversely affected by a catastrophic event. A severe weather event, therefore, could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and business, as well as potentially increase our exposure to credit and liquidity risks.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure data processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We cannot assure you that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may be subject to additional credit risk with respect to loans that we make to other lenders.\nAs a part of our commercial lending activities, we may make loans to customers that, in turn, make commercial and residential real estate loans to other borrowers. When we make a loan of this nature, we take as collateral the promissory notes issued by the end borrowers to our customer, which are themselves secured by the underlying real estate. Although the loans to our customers are subject to the risks inherent in commercial lending generally, we are also exposed to additional risks, including those related to commercial and residential real estate lending, as the ability of our customer to repay the loan from us can be affected by the risks associated with the value and liquidity of the real estate underlying our customer\u2019s loans to the end borrowers. Moreover, because we are not lending directly to the end borrower, and because our collateral is a promissory note rather than the underlying real estate, we may be subject to risks that are different from those we are exposed to when it makes a loan directly that is secured by commercial or residential real estate. Because the ability of the end borrower to repay its loan from our customer could affect the ability of our customer to repay its loan from us, our inability to exercise control over the relationship with the end borrower and the collateral, except under limited circumstances, could expose us to credit losses that adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a concentration of loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers, which may increase our risk of loss.\nWe have extended significant amounts of credit to a limited number of borrowers, and as of December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of loans to our 10 and 20 largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to $155.4 million, or 8.8% of loans held for investment, and $259.9 million, or 14.7% of loans held for investment, respectively. In the event that one or more of these borrowers is not able to make payments of interest and principal in respect of such loans, the potential loss to us is more likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur municipal loan portfolio may be impacted by the effects of economic stress on municipalities and political subdivisions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $56.3 million, or 3.2% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of loans outstanding to municipalities and political subdivisions. Widespread concern currently exists regarding the stress on local governments emanating from declining revenues, large unfunded liabilities to government workers and entrenched cost structures. Debt-to-gross domestic product ratios for many municipalities and political subdivisions have been deteriorating due to, among other factors, declines in federal monetary assistance provided as the United States is currently experiencing the largest deficit in its history and lower levels of sales and property tax revenue. We may not be able to mitigate the exposure in our municipal loan portfolio if municipalities and political subdivisions are unable to fulfill their obligations. The risk of widespread borrower defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit municipalities and political subdivisions to file for bankruptcy protection or if there are judicial interpretations that, in a bankruptcy or other proceeding, lessen the value of any structural protections.\nA lack of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations and adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of our investment securities, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing its net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the FHLB of Dallas. We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the Texas economy, particularly the local economies in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Bryan/College Station, San Antonio-New Braunfels and Tyler metropolitan areas or North Central Texas, or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, could be adversely affected.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, we, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or reduce our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Our profitability depends to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income, or the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2019, meaning that we estimate our net interest income would increase more from rising interest rates than from falling interest rates.\nAdditionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on its loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan portfolio and our overall results. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nUncertainty related to the LIBOR and replacement\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after December 31, 2021. The Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve Bank have jointly formed a committee known as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d) to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the ARRC has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the alternative rate for use in derivatives and other financial contracts currently being indexed to LIBOR. SOFR is a daily index of the interest rate banks and hedge funds pay to borrow money overnight, secured by U.S. Treasury securities. Currently no forward-looking term index (like LIBOR) yet exists and the development of a SOFR-based term rate is ongoing. Historically, SOFR has been lower than LIBOR because it does not take into account bank credit risk. Accordingly, a credit spread adjustment is being considered. Since the proposed SOFR is calculated differently than LIBOR, payments under contracts referencing the new rates may differ from those referencing LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool, and the future of LIBOR is still uncertain.\nWe could recognize losses on investment securities held in its securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate\nWhile we attempt to invest a significant majority of our total assets in loans, we invest a percentage of our total assets (4.1% as of December 31, 2019) in investment securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our available for sale investment securities portfolio was $96.9 million, which included a net unrealized gain of $839 thousand. Factors beyond our control can significantly and adversely influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may incur realized or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct our operations exclusively in Texas, particularly the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Bryan/College Station, San Antonio-New Braunfels and Tyler metropolitan areas and North Central Texas. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within our market areas. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non-bank lenders and certain other non-financial entities, such as retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations\nwhich may offer more favorable financing or deposit terms than we can. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have production offices or otherwise solicit loan and deposit products in our market areas. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin, fee income and profitability. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete with larger competitors for larger customers because our lending limits are lower than our competitors.\nOur legal lending limit is significantly less than the limits for many of our competitors, and this may hinder our ability to establish relationships with larger businesses in our primary service area. Based on the capitalization of the Bank, our legal lending limit was approximately $63.3 million as of December 31, 2019. This legal lending limit will increase or decrease as the Bank\u2019s capital increases or decreases, respectively, as a result of our earnings or losses, among other reasons. Based on our current legal lending limit, we may need to sell participations in our loans to other financial institutions in order to meet the lending needs of our customers requiring extensions of credit above these limits. However, our ability to accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions may not be successful.\nNegative public opinion regarding us or failure to maintain our reputation in the communities we serve could adversely affect our business and prevent us from growing our business.\nAs a community bank, our reputation within the communities we serve is critical to our success. We believe our reputation has set us apart from our competitors by building strong personal and professional relationships with our customers and being active members of the communities we serve. As such, we strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who we believe share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve and delivering superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, we may be less successful in attracting new customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action or delay in acting as we seek to implement our growth strategy.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. Ensuring that we have adequate disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is costly and time-consuming and needs to be reevaluated frequently.\nOur management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective due to our failure to cure any identified material weakness or otherwise. Moreover, even if our management concludes that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may not conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, during the course of the evaluation, documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the SEC for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the FDIC for compliance with the requirement of FDICIA. Any such deficiencies may also subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or FDICIA, and we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nWe expect to incur significant incremental costs related to operating as a public company, particularly when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and NASDAQ, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, we are required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic reports, proxy statements and other shareholder communications in compliance with the federal securities laws and rules;\n\u2022\nexpand the roles and duties of our board of directors and committees thereof;\n\u2022\nmaintain an internal audit function;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance procedures;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above;\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, including those relating to trading in our securities and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nretain additional personnel;\n\u2022\ncomply with NASDAQ listing standards; and\n\u2022\ncomply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe expect these rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which have created uncertainty for public companies, to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These increased costs could require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action or reputational harm due to fraudulent, negligent or other acts on the part of our loan customers, employees or vendors.\nEmployee errors or employee or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding from us unauthorized activities, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors or employee or customer misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls to help mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect us from material losses associated with these risks including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, property appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of such information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any such misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information may not be detected prior to funding a loan or during our ongoing monitoring of outstanding loans. In addition, one or more of our employees or vendors could cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our loan documentation, operations or systems. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to respond to future technological changes and our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our product and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in us not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require it to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nThese changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent it is unable to provide such products and services.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive certain third-party services including, but not limited to, core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, online banking services, deposit processing and other processing services. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs and the impacts of epidemics or pandemics, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt\u037e which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. On January 26, 2020, President Trump signed a new trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The full impact of this agreement on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in our primary banking markets is currently unknown. In addition, coronavirus and concerns regarding the extent to which it may spread have affected, and may increasingly affect, international trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity and other economic activities. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies, as well as coronavirus or other potential epidemics or pandemics, have the potential to negatively impact our and/or our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers\u2019 products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Regulation\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF and the overall financial stability of the banking system in the United States. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee any debt we may issue and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The banking industry remains heavily regulated. Compliance with such regulations may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations. Proposed legislative and regulatory actions, including changes to financial regulation, may not occur on the timeframe that is expected, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services, as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things.\nCertain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes, including laws applicable to the financial industry and federal and state taxation, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any proposed legislative or regulatory changes, including those that could benefit our business, financial condition and results of operations, may not occur on the timeframe that is proposed, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nAs a regulated entity, we and the Bank must maintain certain required levels of regulatory capital that may limit our and the Bank\u2019s operations and potential growth.\nWe and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, respectively. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements and the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet commitments as calculated under these regulations. As of December 31, 2019, the Company and the Bank exceeded the amounts required to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under their respective regulations. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nMany factors affect the calculation of our risk-based assets and our ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable capital ratios. For example, changes in risk weightings of assets relative to capital and other factors may combine to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets in the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio. Any increases in our risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase in our capital to maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized loan losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan impairments, impairment losses on securities and other factors will decrease our capital, thereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios.\nOur failure to remain well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends to the Company and the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, the Company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and on our and the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Under regulatory rules, if we cease to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that we pay on deposits and our ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could adversely affect it.\nTexas and federal bank regulatory agencies, including the TDSML, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a Texas or federal bank regulatory agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we, the Bank or our respective management, were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital levels, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, the Bank or our respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance, with the result that the Bank would be closed. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe intend to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive federal and state regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including our record of compliance with the CRA) and our effectiveness in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell branches or other business lines as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nFinancial institutions, such as the Bank, face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations, and associated enforcement actions.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cJustice Department\u201d), the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by OFAC.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, the dedication of significant resources to an anti-money laundering program is required. Additionally, our business relationships with foreign nationals may expose us to greater risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations than other financial institutions who have less expansive business relationships with foreign nationals than us. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and on expansion opportunities, including acquisitions.\nWe are subject to numerous lending laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material sanctions and penalties and restrictions on our expansion opportunities.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the FDIC, the Justice Department and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, a bank holding company may be required to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank at times when the bank holding company may not be inclined to do so and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Accordingly, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nSuch a capital injection may be required at a time when our resources are limited and we may be required to raise capital or borrow the funds to make the required capital injection. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Any such losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although we cannot determine the effects of such policies on it at this time, such policies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nWe completed the initial public offering of our common stock and the Company\u2019s common stock began trading on NASDAQ in May 2018. An active trading market for shares of our common stock may not be sustained. If an active trading market is not sustained, you may have difficulty selling your shares of our common stock at an attractive price, or at all. Consequently, you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above an attractive price at the time that you would like to sell. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our common stock and may impair our ability to expand our business by using our common stock as consideration in an acquisition.\nThe market price of our common stock could be volatile and may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe perception that investment in Texas is unattractive or less attractive during periods of low oil or gas prices;\n\u2022\nthe public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements or our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, innovations or new programs and services;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in business, legal or regulatory conditions, or other developments affecting participants in our industry, or publicity regarding our business or any of our significant customers or competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental monetary policies, including the policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by us or our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders; and\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in and political conditions affecting our target markets.\nIn particular, the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and cause the value of our common stock to decline. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for banks and financial services companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, its stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business. We cannot predict whether any research analysts will cover us and our common stock nor do we have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, either absolutely or relative to our competitors, the price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing additional shares of our common stock. Future sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments and pursuant to compensation and incentive plans. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition or under a compensation or incentive plan), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of its securities.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise materially adversely affect our shareholders, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of formation authorizes us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of our shareholders.\nWe currently have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, so you may not receive funds without selling your shares of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us, which is limited by applicable laws and banking regulations, and may in the future be restricted by the terms of any debt or preferred securities we may incur or issue. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay dividends. In addition, our current line of credit restricts our ability to pay dividends and in the future we may enter into other borrowing or other contractual arrangements that restricts our ability to pay dividends. Accordingly, shares of our common stock should not be purchased by persons who need or desire dividend income from their investment.\nWe are dependent upon the Bank for cash flow, and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted, which could impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nOur primary asset is the Bank. As such, we depend upon the Bank for cash distributions through dividends on the Bank\u2019s stock to pay our operating expenses and satisfy our obligations, including debt obligations. There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we will not be able to satisfy our obligations. Federal and state statutes and regulations restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to us. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, federal and state banking authorities have the ability to restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends through supervisory action.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions allow us, among other things, to present only two years of audited financial statements and discuss our results of operations for only two years in related Management\u2019s Discussions and Analyses; not to provide an auditor attestation of our internal control over financial reporting; to choose not to comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and our audited financial statements; to provide reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, which means we do not have to include a compensation discussion and analysis and certain other disclosure regarding our executive compensation; and not to seek a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. In addition, even if we decide to comply with the greater disclosure obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail our self of these reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as it is an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700.0 million). Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock because we may rely on one or more of these exemptions, and, as a result, investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur shareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us, which could impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nWe are subject to the BHC Act, and federal and state banking regulation, that will impact the rights and obligations of owners of our common stock, including, for example, our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. Shares of our common stock are voting securities for purposes of the BHC Act and any bank holding company or foreign bank that is subject to the BHC Act may need approval to acquire or retain 5.0% or more of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, and any holder (or group of holders deemed to be acting in concert) may need regulatory approval to acquire or retain 10.0% or more of the shares of our common stock. A holder or group of holders may also be deemed to control us if they own 25.0% or more of its total equity. Under certain limited circumstances, a holder or group of holders acting in concert may exceed the 25.0% threshold and not be deemed to control us until they own 33.3% or more of our total equity. The amount of total equity owned by a holder or group of holders acting in concert is calculated by aggregating all shares held by the holder or group, whether as a combination of voting or non-voting shares or through other positions treated as equity for regulatory or accounting purposes and meeting certain other conditions. Our shareholders should consult their own counsel with regard to regulatory implications.\nOur directors and executive officers could have the ability to influence shareholder actions in a manner that may be adverse to your personal investment objectives.\nDue to the significant ownership interests of our directors and executive officers, our directors and executive officers are able to exercise significant influence over our management and affairs. For example, our directors and executive officers may be able to influence the outcome of director elections or block significant transactions, such as a merger or acquisition, or any other matter that might otherwise be approved by the shareholders.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC, so you could lose some or all of your investment.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nOur corporate organizational documents and certain corporate and banking provisions of Texas law to which it is subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of us that you may favor.\nOur certificate of formation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of us. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nstaggered terms for directors, who may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022\nauthorization for our board of directors to issue shares of one or more series of preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine;\n\u2022\na prohibition of shareholder action by less than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\na prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\na provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election of directors and for shareholder proposals; and\n\u2022\na limitation on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings to those shareholders or groups of shareholders owning at least 50.0% of the shares of our common stock that are issued, outstanding and entitled to vote.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of us, even in the case where our shareholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable.\nOur certificate of formation does not provide for cumulative voting for directors and authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of our preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a controlling interest in us. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control.\nIn addition, banking laws impose notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nOur certificate of formation contains an exclusive forum provision that limits the judicial forums where our shareholders may initiate derivative actions and certain other legal proceedings against us and our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of formation provides that the state and federal courts located in Montgomery County, Texas will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any actual or purported derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of its directors or officers arising pursuant to the Texas Business Organization Code, our certificate of formation or bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of formation or bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any of its directors or officers that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision in our certificate of formation may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of formation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 17802, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STXB"}
