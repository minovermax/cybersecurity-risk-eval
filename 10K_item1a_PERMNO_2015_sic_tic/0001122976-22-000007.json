RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nGlobal Operating Risks\nOur operations could be adversely affected by various risks inherent in conducting operations worldwide.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the U.S., with approximately 53% of our sales in foreign countries. We currently have many facilities located outside the U.S., as detailed in Item 2. \u201cProperties.\u201d Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements, and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022changes in local government regulations and policies including, but not limited to, duty or tariff restrictions, foreign currency exchange controls or monetary policy, repatriation of earnings, expropriation of property, investment limitations and tax policies;\n\u2022political and economic instability and disruptions, including labor unrest, withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements, natural disasters, major public health issues, pandemics, civil strife, acts of war, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u2022legislation that regulates the use of chemicals;\n\u2022disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act;\n\u2022compliance with international trade laws and regulations, including export control and economic sanctions;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022reduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas where our operations are conducted; and\n\u2022increasingly complex laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, including, but not limited to, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us if reckless or criminal acts are committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, UK Bribery Act, export control or sanction violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing demand for our products.\n8 AVIENT CORPORATION\nBusiness Risks\nDemand for and supply of our products and services have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by several factors, some of which we cannot predict or control.\nSeveral factors have in the past and may in the future affect the demand for and supply of our products and services, including:\n\u2022economic downturns or other volatility in the significant end markets that we serve;\n\u2022product obsolescence or technological changes that unfavorably alter the value/cost proposition of our products and services;\n\u2022competition from existing and unforeseen polymer and non-polymer based products;\n\u2022declines in general economic conditions or reductions in industrial production growth rates, both domestically and globally, which could impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay amounts owed to us;\n\u2022changes in environmental regulations that limit our ability to sell our products and services in specific markets;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations regarding plastic materials; and\n\u2022inability to obtain raw materials or supply products to customers due to factors such as supplier work stoppages, supply shortages, plant outages or regulatory changes that may limit or prohibit overland transportation of certain hazardous materials and exogenous factors, like severe weather.\nIf any of these events occur in the future, the demand for and supply of our products and services could suffer and potentially lead to asset impairment or otherwise adversely affect our results.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to hazards and other risks associated with specialty formulation and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes.\nThe occurrence of an operating problem at our facilities may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing or distribution facility or on our operations as a whole, during and after the period of these operating difficulties. Operating problems may cause personal injury and/or loss of life, customer attrition and severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. We are subject to present claims and potential future claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers\u2019 compensation and other matters. Our property and casualty insurance, which we believe are of the types and in the amounts that are customary for the industry, may not fully insure us against all potential hazards that are incident to our business or otherwise could occur.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations impact our operations and financial statements.\nOur operations on, and ownership of, real property are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at the national, state and local governmental levels (including, but not limited to, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008). The nature of our business exposes us to compliance costs and risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, transportation, recycling or disposal and/or sale of materials that can cause contamination and other harm to the environment or personal injury if they are improperly handled and released. Environmental compliance requirements imposed on us and our vendors may significantly increase the costs of these activities involving raw materials, energy, finished products and wastes. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, criminal or civil sanctions, damages, and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations of these laws.\nElectricity, fuel, logistics and raw material costs could cause volatility in our results.\nThe cost of our electricity, fuel, logistics and raw materials may not correlate with changes in the prices we receive for our products, either in the direction of the price change or in absolute magnitude. Electricity and raw materials costs represent a substantial part of our manufacturing costs. Most of the raw materials we use are commodities and the price of each can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability because of major capacity additions or reductions or significant facility operating problems. Other external factors beyond our control can also cause fluctuations in raw materials prices, which could negatively impact demand for our products and cause volatility in our results.\n9 AVIENT CORPORATION\nWe face competition from other companies.\nWe encounter competition in price, payment terms, delivery, service, performance, product innovation, product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved.\nWe expect that our competitors will continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of our products. In addition, our competitors could cause a reduction in the selling prices of some of our products as a result of intensified price competition. Competitive pressures could also result in the loss of customers.\nCybersecurity breaches, global information systems security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks and products, which could harm our business.\nWe depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business, including communicating with employees and customers, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products to customers, and analyzing and reporting results of operations. In addition, we store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data, on our servers and databases. Cybersecurity breaches, global information systems security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, employee training and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their recurrence; however, our systems, networks and products may nevertheless be vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other types of system failures. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats and system failures could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could cause customers to cancel orders or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and we could experience similar incidents in the future. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to risks associated with potential climate change legislation, regulation and international agreements.\nCarbon emissions have become the subject of an increasing amount of state and local, regional, national, and international attention. Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject. These future regulatory developments related to climate change are likely and could increase our operating and compliance costs, thereby impacting our business and consolidated financial statements.\nCapital and Credit Risks\nDisruptions in the global credit, financial and/or currency markets could limit our access to credit or otherwise harm our financial results, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nGlobal credit and financial markets experience volatility, including volatility in security prices, liquidity and credit availability, declining valuations of certain investments and significant changes in the capital and organizational structures of certain financial institutions. Market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to grow and maintain our business. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenors than we prefer or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the U.S. dollar, whether precipitated by governmental monetary policy or otherwise, could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nThe agreements governing our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loan and other debt instruments, contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and in certain circumstances require us to meet financial maintenance tests, failure to comply with which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan, and the indentures and credit agreements governing our other debt, contain a number of customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: sell or otherwise transfer assets, including in a spin-off, incur additional\n10 AVIENT CORPORATION\ndebt or liens, consolidate or merge with any entity or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries, make capital investments and alter the business we conduct.\nIn addition, depending on our level of borrowing, our revolving credit facility requires us to comply under certain circumstances with specific financial tests, under which we are required to achieve certain or specific financial and operating results. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under such agreements and instruments, which in certain circumstances could be a default under all of these agreements and instruments. In the event of any default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the agreements, together with accrued interest thereon, to be due and payable. In such event, we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to pay debt then outstanding under the agreements governing our debt.\nFurthermore, certain of these agreements condition our ability to obtain additional borrowing capacity, engage in certain transactions or take certain other actions, on our achievement of certain or specific financial and operating results, although our failure to achieve such results would not result in a default under such agreements. Any future refinancing of our senior secured revolving credit facility or other debt may contain similar restrictive covenants.\nTo service our indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash.\nOur ability to pay interest on our debt and to satisfy our other debt obligations depends in part upon our future financial and operating performance and that of our subsidiaries, and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, affect our ability to make these payments. While we believe that cash flow from our current level of operations, available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility provide adequate sources of liquidity, a significant drop in operating cash flow resulting from economic conditions, competition or other uncertainties beyond our control could create the need for alternative sources of liquidity. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, we will have to pursue one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital or other expenditures, refinancing debt, selling assets, or raising equity capital.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, and any future goodwill impairment charges could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had goodwill of $1,286.4 million. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a material negative change in relationships with customers, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions could result in goodwill impairment charges, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Based on our 2021 goodwill impairment test, performed as of October 1, 2021, no reporting units were identified as being at risk of future impairment. For additional information, see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d included in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have continued to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it has impacted our customers, employees, supply chain, and distribution network. In response to the pandemic, we implemented changes in our business designed to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers and to support appropriate physical distancing and other health and safety protocols. We implemented remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible, including implementing split shifts at facilities and remote work options for non-essential on-site functions, enhanced cleaning and sanitary procedures, implemented domestic and international travel restrictions, implemented return to work and visitor screening protocols, and postponed or canceled hosting or attending large events. The scope and duration of the pandemic continues to be uncertain, and evolving factors such as the level and timing of vaccine distribution across the world and the extent of any resurgences of the virus or emergence of new variants could impact the stability of the economic recovery and growth. The extent to which our future operations may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on these future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\n11 AVIENT CORPORATION\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has in the past and could in the future negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022shutdowns or slowdowns of our production facilities;\n\u2022disruptions in our supply chain and our ability to obtain raw materials, packaging and other sourced materials due to labor shortages, governmental restrictions or the failure of our suppliers, distributors or manufacturers to meet their obligations to us;\n\u2022increases in raw material and commodity costs;\n\u2022the inability of a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, to work as a result of illness or government restrictions; and\n\u2022reduced liquidity of customers, which could negatively impact the collectability of outstanding receivables and our cash flows.\nThe extent to which our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows may ultimately be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on these future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks and uncertainties described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, any of which could have a material effect on us.", "PERMNO": 88597, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "AVNT"}
