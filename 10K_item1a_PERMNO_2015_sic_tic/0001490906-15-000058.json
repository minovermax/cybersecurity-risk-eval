Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of risk factors relating to the operations of the Bank and the Company. These risk factors are not necessarily presented in order of significance.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, MBS, and investment securities and dividends received on FHLB stock, and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition because the majority of our interest-earning assets are long-term, fixed-rate loans, while the majority of our interest-bearing liabilities are shorter term, and therefore subject to a greater degree of interest rate fluctuations. This type of risk is known as interest rate risk and is affected by prevailing economic and competitive conditions, including monetary policies of the FRB and fiscal policies of the United States federal government.\nThe impact of changes in interest rates is generally observed on the income statement. The magnitude of the impact will be determined by the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time. This difference provides an indication of the extent to which our net interest rate spread will be impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rates will impact the expected level of repricing of the Bank's mortgage-related assets and callable debt securities. Generally, as interest rates decline, the amount of interest-earning assets expected to reprice will increase as borrowers have an economic incentive to reduce the cost of their mortgage or debt, which would negatively impact the Bank's interest income. Conversely, as interest rates rise, the amount of interest-earning assets expected to reprice will decline as the economic incentive to refinance the mortgage or debt is diminished. As this occurs, the amount of interest-earning assets repricing could diminish to the point where interest-bearing liabilities reprice to a higher interest rate, at a faster pace, than interest-earning assets, thus negatively impacting the Bank's net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition as AFS securities are reported at estimated fair value. We increase or decrease our stockholders' equity, specifically AOCI (loss), by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of our AFS securities, net of deferred taxes. Increases in interest rates generally decrease the fair value of AFS securities. Decreases in the fair value of AFS securities would, therefore, adversely impact stockholders' equity.\nChanges in interest rates, as they relate to customers, can also have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In times of rising interest rates, default risk may increase among borrowers with ARM loans as the rates on their loans adjust upward and their payments increase. Fluctuations in interest rates also affect customer demand for deposit products. Local competition could affect our ability to attract deposits, or could result in us paying more than competitors for deposits.\nIn addition to general changes in interest rates, changes that affect the shape of the yield curve could negatively impact the Bank. The Bank's interest-bearing liabilities are generally priced based on short-term interest rates while the majority of the Bank's interest-earning assets are priced based on long-term interest rates. Income for the Bank is primarily driven by the spread between these rates. As a result, a steeper yield curve, meaning long-term interest rates are significantly higher than short-term interest rates, would provide the Bank with a better opportunity to increase net interest income. When the yield curve is flat, meaning long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates are essentially the same, or when the yield curve is inverted, meaning long-term interest rates are lower than short-term interest rates, the yield between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that reprice is compressed or diminished and would likely negatively impact the Bank's net interest income.\nFinancial institutions face a variety of risks from cyber attacks including liquidity, capital, operational, compliance and reputation risks, resulting from fraud, data loss, extortion and disruption of customer service. The occurrence of any failure, breach or interruption in service involving our systems or those of our service providers, including as a result of a cyber attack, could damage our reputation, cause losses, increase our expenses and result in a loss of customers, cause an increase in regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possibly financial liability, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our stock.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits and our loans. In the normal course of our business, we collect, process, retain and transmit (by email and other electronic means) sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others. We also outsource certain aspects of our data processing to certain third party providers. In addition to confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others, we, and in some cases a third party, compile, process, transmit and store proprietary, non-public information concerning our business, operations, plans and strategies.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have increased recently in part because of evolving technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. Cyber criminals and activists use a variety of tactics, such as ransomware, denial of service, and theft of sensitive business and customer information to extort payment or other concessions from victims. In some cases, these attacks have caused significant impacts on businesses' access to data and ability to provide services. Other businesses have incurred serious damage through the release of sensitive information. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all incidents of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\nWe use a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches and to protect confidential information from mishandling, misuse or loss, including detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be promptly detected and adequately addressed if they do, and early detection of security breaches may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. If there is a failure in or breach of our computer systems or networks, or those of a third-party service provider, the confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, such computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized, or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers, clients or counterparties.\nOur business and operations depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third party service providers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security measures, risk management practices, relationships with threat intelligence providers and business continuity planning, our facilities, computer systems, software and networks, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. In addition, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of our customers, clients or counterparties. While we regularly conduct security and risk assessments on our systems and those of our third party service providers, there can be no assurance that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber attack or other security breach.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could subject us to litigation or regulatory scrutiny, cause us significant reputational damage or erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, cause us to lose customers or have greater difficulty in attracting new customers, have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock or subject us to financial losses that may not be covered by insurance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance or modify our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks.\nAn economic downturn, especially one affecting our geographic market area, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one- to four-family first loans on residential properties; therefore, we are particularly exposed to downturns in regional housing markets and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. housing market. The primary risks inherent in our one- to four-family loan portfolio are declines in economic conditions, elevated levels of unemployment or underemployment, and declines in residential real estate values. Any one or a combination of these events may have an adverse impact on borrowers' ability to repay their loans, which could result in increased delinquencies, non-performing assets, loan losses, and future loan loss provisions.\nAdditionally, we have a concentration of loans secured in Kansas and Missouri due to our lending practices. Approximately 59% of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by property located in Kansas, and approximately 19% is comprised of loans secured by property located in Missouri. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in local economies and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in these local economies such as inflation, unemployment, recession, natural disasters, or other factors beyond our control, could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Decreases in local real estate values could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure. Currently, there is not a single employer or industry in the area on which the majority of our customers are dependent.\nThe increase in multi-family and commercial real estate and construction loans in our loan portfolio exposes us to increased lending risks.\nA growing portion of our loan portfolio consists of multi-family and commercial real estate and construction loans. These types of loans generally expose the Bank to a greater risk of delinquencies, non-performing assets, loan losses, and future loan loss provisions than one- to four-family residential real estate loans because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations of a business or of the underlying property. Additionally, such loans often involve multiple loans to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, and generally have significantly larger average loan balances compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans. As a result, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. Also, a large portion of our multi-family and commercial real estate and construction loans were originated/participated in during the past two fiscal years, which makes it difficult to assess the future performance of these loans because of their relatively limited payment history from which to judge future collectability. We continually monitor the level of risk in the portfolio, including concentrations in such factors as geographic locations, property types, tenant brand name, borrowing relationships, and lending relationships in the case of participation loans, among other factors.\nWe may be required to provide remedial consideration to borrowers whose loans we purchase from correspondent and nationwide lenders if it is discovered that the originating company did not properly comply with lending regulations during the origination process.\nWe purchase whole one- to four-family loans from correspondent and nationwide lenders. While loans purchased on a loan-by-loan basis from correspondent lenders are underwritten by the Bank's underwriters and loans purchased in bulk packages from correspondent and nationwide lenders are evaluated on a certain set of criteria before being purchased, we are still subject to some risks associated with the loan origination process itself. By law, loan originators are required to comply with lending regulations at all times during the origination process. Certain compliance related risks associated with the origination process itself may shift from the originating company to the Bank once the Bank purchases the loan. Should it be discovered, at any point, that an instance of noncompliance occurred by the originating company during the origination process, the Bank may still be held responsible and required to remedy the issue for the loans it purchased from the originator. Remedial actions can include such actions as refunding interest paid to the borrower and adjusting the contractual interest rate on the loan to the current market rate if advantageous to the borrower. The Bank no longer purchases loans in bulk from nationwide lenders due primarily to these risks.\nStrong competition may limit growth and profitability.\nWhile we are one of the largest mortgage loan originators in the state of Kansas, we compete in the same market areas as local, regional, and national banks, credit unions, mortgage brokerage firms, investment banking firms, investment brokerage firms, and savings institutions. We must also compete with online investment and mortgage brokerages and online banks that are not confined to any specific market area. Many of these competitors operate on a national or regional level, are a conglomerate of various financial services providers housed under one corporation, or otherwise have substantially greater\nfinancial or technological resources than the Bank. We compete primarily on the basis of the interest rates offered to depositors, the terms of loans offered to borrowers, and the benefits afforded to customers as a local institution and portfolio lender. Should we face competitive pressure to increase deposit rates or decrease loan rates, our net interest income could be adversely affected. Additionally, our competitors may offer products and services that we do not or cannot provide, as certain deposit and loan products fall outside of our accepted level of risk. Our profitability depends upon our ability to compete in our local market areas.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities and will continue to increase our operational and compliance costs.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC, FRB, and the FDIC. These regulatory authorities exercise broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank's operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank's ACL, and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws, including a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, like the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive or abusive\" acts and practices. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with end-of-period regulatory assets exceeding $10 billion for four consecutive quarters. The Company does not currently have regulatory assets in excess of $10 billion and has not exceeded $10 billion in regulatory assets for four consecutive quarters, but it may at some point in the future. Banks with $10 billion or less in end-of-period regulatory assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws and regulations of the CFPB by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. Change in the authority and oversight of any of these agencies, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation, or additional deposit insurance premiums, could have a material impact on our operations.\nSince the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has issued a number of new rules and regulations and changed existing consumer protections regulations, including new rules that generally prohibit creditors from extending mortgage loans without regard for the consumer's ability-to-repay and add restrictions and requirements to mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules limit prepayment penalties and require the creditor to retain evidence of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirement for three years. Compliance with these rules has, and may continue to, change our underwriting practices with respect to mortgage loans and increase our overall regulatory compliance costs. Moreover, these rules may adversely affect the volume of mortgage loans that we originate and may subject us to increased potential liabilities related to such residential loan origination activities.\nThe potential exists for additional laws and regulations, or changes in policy, affecting lending practices, regulatory capital limits, interest rate risk management, and liquidity standards. Moreover, bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements and/or assessing monetary penalties. Bank regulatory agencies, such as the OCC and the FDIC, govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors, and not for the protection or benefit of investors. The CFPB enforces consumer protection laws and regulations for the benefit of the consumer and not the protection or benefit of investors. In addition, new laws and regulations may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and securities, the products we offer, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company.\nThe long-term ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company, and also on the availability of cash at the holding company level in the event earnings are not sufficient to pay dividends.\nThe Company's risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces. These risks include: interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, reputation, compliance and litigation. While the Company assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company's risk-management program, or if its controls break down, the performance and value of its business could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86820, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CFFN"}
