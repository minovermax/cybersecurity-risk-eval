Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this report, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This report also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.\nWe have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness). We have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, under our senior credit facility (the \u201c2014 Senior Credit Facility\u201d). In addition, the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding 7\u00bd% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) (as supplemented, the \u201cindenture\u201d) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.\nOur substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.\nOur ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the indenture and the agreements governing the 2014 Senior Credit Facility, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;\n\u25cf\ndeclare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u25cf\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ncreate liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u25cf\nissue guarantees;\n\u25cf\nmerge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf\namend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u25cf\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf\npurchase, sell or transfer certain assets.\nAny of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nThe indenture and the 2014 Senior Credit Facility also require us to comply with a number of financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are also required to comply with a number of financial covenants under the indenture and the 2014 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture or the 2014 Senior Credit Facility.\nUpon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debt holders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR \u201d) were to exceed certain levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations would decrease.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and will also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:\n\u25cf\neconomic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u25cf\nthe popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;\n\u25cf\nlocal and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;\n\u25cf\nour competitors\u2019 activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;\n\u25cf\nthe duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;\n\u25cf\ndecisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;\n\u25cf\nlabor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and\n\u25cf\nother factors beyond our control.\nOur results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations that we expect to continue. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to (i) advertisers\u2019 increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending and (ii) an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even and odd numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations. In even-numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we derived approximately 16% and 1%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the network broadcasting the Olympic Games typically experience increased viewership and revenue during that coverage, which also occurs in even-numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, potential investors are cautioned that it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations.\nContinued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFinancial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers\u2019 businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, continued volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests.\nOur dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business.\nWe consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013, we derived a material portion of our non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we derived approximately 21% and 25%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances, industries, declined.\nIn addition, in even-numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers as described above. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected.\nWe seek to selectively evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy.\nWe intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements.\nAn acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, which includes risks associated with:\n\u25cf\nidentifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;\n\u25cf\nintegrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;\n\u25cf\nobtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;\n\u25cf\ndiverting our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf\npotentially losing key employees at acquired stations; and\n\u25cf\npotential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.\nOur failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition.\nThe success of our strategic acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions.\nWe are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries\u2019 earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.\nWe must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs.\nOne of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recoup the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year\u2019s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.\nWe are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement.\nOur business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Each of our stations is affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through August 31, 2019.\nIf we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network\u2019s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC.\nWe can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks imposed more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime.\nWe are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years, and no significant retransmission consent agreement expires prior to December 31, 2015. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated.\nFor example, on March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under the new rules, top-four stations may not (i) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned top-four station located in the same DMA or to a third party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned top-four television station in the same DMA; or (ii) facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how this restriction might impact future opportunities.\nAs part of its decision, the FCC also sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming.\nIn addition, certain online video distributors (\u201cOVDs\u201d) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the Internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. To date, federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming because the courts have concluded that OVD are unlikely to demonstrate that they are eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming. We cannot predict whether the courts will continue to issue similar injunctions against future OVDs. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs.\nCongress also continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected.\nTelevision stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station\u2019s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks\u2019 viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations.\nIn addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation.\nOur inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur pension plan obligations are currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which could reduce the cash available for our business.\nWe have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years.\nWe do not currently pay cash dividends on either class of our common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced.\nOur Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on our common stock or Class A common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in the 2014 Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on either class of common stock.\nAs a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock and Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. As a result we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $1.0 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $374.4 million, in comparison to total assets of $1.9 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write-down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets.\nCybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. We have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents however, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient.\nFederal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility.\nThe FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFederal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results.\nThe FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent.\nOver the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $350,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC\u2019s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC\u2019s ability to regulate broadcast content. The FCC has not yet issued any further decisions concerning its indecency enforcement authority, and the courts remain free to review the FCC\u2019s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FCC\u2019s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market.\nThe FCC\u2019s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having \u201cattributable interests\u201d in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed. Accordingly, those rules constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions.\nThe FCC\u2019s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach.\nUnder the FCC\u2019s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions.\nThe FCC\u2019s National Broadband Plan could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband or other non-broadcast use, which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services.\nIn 2010, the FCC delivered to Congress a \u201cNational Broadband Plan.\u201d The National Broadband Plan, among other things, made recommendations regarding the use of spectrum currently allocated to television broadcasters, including seeking the voluntary surrender of certain portions of the television broadcast spectrum and repacking the currently allocated spectrum to make portions of that spectrum available for other wireless communications services.\nIn late February 2012, Congress passed and the President signed legislation that, among other things, grants the FCC authority to conduct auctions of certain spectrum currently used by television broadcasters. These auctions would have two parts. First, the FCC would conduct a reverse auction by which a television broadcaster may volunteer, in return for payment, to relinquish its station\u2019s spectrum by surrendering its license; relinquish part of its spectrum and thereafter share spectrum with another station; or modify a UHF channel license to a VHF channel license. Second, the FCC would conduct a forward auction of the relinquished auction to new users. The FCC must complete the reverse auction and the forward auction by September 30, 2022. To accommodate the spectrum reallocation to new users, the FCC may require that television stations that do not participate in the auction modify their transmission facilities. The legislation authorizes the FCC to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs up to a total across all stations of $1.75 billion. In addition, the legislation directs the FCC to use \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to preserve a station\u2019s coverage area and population served, and it prevents the FCC from requiring that a station involuntarily move from the UHF band to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band. If some or all of our television stations are required to change frequencies or reduce the amount of spectrum they use, our stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams, including mobile video services.\nOn April 27, 2012, the FCC issued a Report and Order modifying the FCC\u2019s rules to establish a licensing framework to allow two or more broadcast stations to share a 6Mhz channel. On May 15, 2014, the FCC adopted the 2014 Report that established the framework for implementation of an incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum. Various groups challenged the rules adopted in the 2014 Order at the FCC and US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The FCC continues to develop and seek public comment on final auction policies and procedures. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any Congressional, FCC regulatory, or Court action with respect to the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, incentive auctions, or repacking of broadcast television spectrum, nor the impact of any such changes upon our business.", "PERMNO": 83989, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "GTN"}
