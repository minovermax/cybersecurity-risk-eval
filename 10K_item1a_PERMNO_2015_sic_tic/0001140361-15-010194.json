{"cik": "892222", "company": "CRAFT BREW ALLIANCE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIf we are unable to gauge trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our sales and market share may decrease and our gross margin may be adversely affected.\nThe costs and management attention involved in maintaining an innovative brand portfolio have been, and are expected to continue to be, significant. If we have not gauged consumer preferences correctly, or are unable to maintain consistently high quality beers as we develop new brands, our overall brand image may be damaged. If this were to occur, our future sales, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. Also, increased costs associated with developing new products may have a negative effect on our gross margin.\nIncreased competition could adversely affect sales and results of operations.\nWe compete in the highly competitive craft beer market, as well as in the much larger specialty beer category, which includes the imported beer segment and fuller-flavored beers offered by major national brewers. We also face increasing competition from producers of wine, spirits and flavored alcohol beverages offered by the larger spirit producers and national brewers. Increased competition could cause our future sales and results of operations to be adversely affected.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely on computer information systems in the conduct of our business. We have policies and procedures in place to protect against and reduce the occurrence of failures, interruptions, or breaches of security of these systems. However, there can be no assurances that these policies and procedures will eliminate the occurrence of failures, interruptions or breaches of security or that they will adequately restore our systems or minimize any such events. The occurrence of a failure, interruption or breach of security of our computer information systems could result in loss of intellectual property, delays in our production, loss of critical information, or other events, any of which could harm our future sales or operating results.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our employees, or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand image and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, our current data protection measures might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats and the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nOur business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending.\nConsumer demand for luxury or perceived luxury goods, including craft beer, can be sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, job losses and the resultant rising unemployment rate, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, and changes in consumer confidence in the economy, could significantly reduce customer demand for craft beer in general, and the products we offer specifically. Furthermore, our consumers may choose to replace our products with the fuller-flavored national brands or other more affordable, although lower quality, alternatives available in the market. Any such decline in consumption of our products would likely have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nChanges in consumer preferences or public attitudes about alcohol could decrease demand for our products.\nIf consumers were unwilling to accept our products or if general consumer trends caused a decrease in the demand for beer, including craft beer, it would adversely impact our sales and results of operations. There is no assurance that the craft brewing segment will continue to experience growth in future periods. If the markets for wine, spirits or flavored alcohol beverages continue to grow, this could draw consumers away from the beer industry in general and our products specifically and have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. Further, the alcoholic beverage industry has become the subject of considerable societal and political attention in recent years due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related social problems, including drunk driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. As an outgrowth of these concerns, the possibility exists that advertising by beer producers could be restricted, that additional cautionary labeling or packaging requirements may be imposed or that there may be renewed efforts to impose, at either the federal or state level, increased excise or other taxes on beer sold in the United States. If beer in general were to fall out of favor among domestic consumers, or if the domestic beer industry were subjected to significant additional governmental regulation, it would likely have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nProduct safety and quality concerns may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards which we expect our breweries and our brewing partner to meet. However, we cannot assure you that, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we will always meet these standards. If we, or our brewing partner, fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards and our products on the market are, or become, contaminated or adulterated, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our reputation and business to suffer.\nWe have a continuing relationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC and the current distribution network that would be difficult to replace.\nSubstantially all of our products are sold and distributed through A-B\u2019s distribution network. If the A-B Distributor Agreement were terminated, we would be faced with a number of operational tasks, including establishing and maintaining direct contracts with the existing wholesaler network or negotiating agreements with replacement wholesalers on an individual basis, and enhancing our credit evaluation, billing and accounts receivable processes. Such an undertaking would require significant effort and substantial time to complete, during which the distribution of our products could be impaired.\nWe are dependent on our wholesalers for the sale of our products.\nAlthough substantially all of our products are sold and distributed through A-B, we continue to rely heavily on wholesalers, most of which are independent, for the sale of our products to retailers. Independent wholesalers make their own business decisions that may not align with our interests and there is no assurance that the sales efforts of distributors will be effective in generating sales of our products. Any disruption in the ability of the wholesalers, A-B, or us to distribute products efficiently due to any significant operational problems, such as wide-spread labor union strikes or the loss of a major wholesaler as a customer, could hinder our ability to get our products to retailers and could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations and cash flows. A-B has been purchasing distributors in states where it is legally permissible, which could impact our distribution if the A-B relationship were to end. 32% of our shipments during 2014 were through A-B owned distributors.\nOur agreements with A-B may limit our ability to engage in certain activities and investments.\nThe Exchange Agreement requires us to obtain A-B's consent prior to undertaking certain activities and investments. For example, we must obtain A-B's consent before acquiring another brewer if the purchase price exceeds $30 million or to purchase a non-brewing entity if the purchase price exceeds $2 million. If A-B opposes strategic or financial investments proposed by our management, A-B may decline to give its consent to activities or investments that our management believes are in the best interest of our shareholders.\nA-B has an influential voice in decisions of the board of directors and shareholders.\nA-B has acquired craft breweries and is seeking to increase sales in the high-end category while it owns 31.7% of our outstanding common stock, which makes A-B our largest shareholder. Under the Exchange Agreement, A-B may designate two nominees to our board of directors, who also participate on our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees as non-voting observers. This gives A-B an influential voice in board and shareholder deliberations.\nOperating breweries at production levels substantially below their current designed capacities could negatively impact our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the annual working capacity of our breweries was approximately 1,075,000 barrels. Due to many factors, including seasonality and production schedules of various draft products and bottled products and packages, actual production capacity will rarely, if ever, approach full working capacity. We believe that capacity utilization of the breweries will fluctuate throughout the year, and even though we expect that capacity of our breweries will be efficiently utilized during periods when our sales are strongest, there likely will be periods when the capacity utilization will be lower. If we experience contraction in our sales volumes, the resulting excess capacity and unabsorbed overhead will have an adverse effect on our gross margins, operating cash flows and overall financial performance. We periodically evaluate whether we expect to recover the costs of our production breweries over the course of their useful lives. If facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability will be performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future undiscounted cash flows along with other quantitative and qualitative analyses. If we determine that the carrying value of such assets does not appear to be recoverable, we will recognize an impairment loss by a charge against current operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur sales are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest and California.\nApproximately 53% of our sales in 2014 were in the Pacific Northwest and California and, consequently, our future sales may be adversely affected by changes in economic and business conditions within these areas. We also believe these regions are among the most competitive craft beer markets in the United States, both in terms of number of market participants and consumer awareness. The Pacific Northwest and California offer significant competition to our products, not only from other craft brewers, but also from the major domestic brewers, wine producers and flavored alcohol beverages.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our key personnel.\nWe may be unable to retain or recruit qualified personnel in key positions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, the loss of Andrew Thomas as our chief executive officer, and the failure to find a replacement satisfactory to A-B, would be a termination event under the A-B Distributor Agreement.\nOur gross margin may fluctuate.\nFuture gross margin may fluctuate and even decline as a result of many factors, including: product pricing levels; sales mix between draft and packaged product sales and within the various bottled product packages; level of fixed and semi-variable operating costs; level of production at our breweries in relation to current production capacity; availability and prices of raw materials, production inputs such as energy, and packaging materials; rates charged for freight; and federal and state excise taxes. The high percentage of fixed and semi-variable operating costs causes our gross margin to be particularly sensitive to relatively small changes in sales volume.\nHigher health care costs may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are self-insured with respect to health care expenses for our employees. During 2014, we experienced higher than average medical expense claims, which increased our Selling, general and administrative expenses. If this trend continues, our operating results may be negatively affected.\nA failure in any of our supply chain processes could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur results are highly dependent on our ability to accurately forecast and execute throughout the entire supply chain, including sales forecasting, raw material ordering, brewing and distribution. The combination of our recent growth and increased brand complexity has increased the operating complexity of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will effectively manage such complexity without experiencing planning failures, operating inefficiencies or other issues that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe engage in electronic communications between third parties, including A-B and our wholesalers, as part of our supply chain processes. Any interruptions or errors in our electronic interfaces may negatively affect our operating activities.\nUnavailability of production at our brewing partner may adversely affect our capacity and disrupt our ability to satisfy demand for our products.\nDuring 2014, we entered into a contract brewing relationship with our brewing partner in Memphis, Tennessee, and anticipate producing up to 100,000 barrels of our beer at that facility annually. If production at that facility should be disrupted due to unforeseen circumstances, our ability to produce and ship sufficient quantities of our beer to meet demand in certain key geographic markets, particularly Texas and the southeastern United States, could be significantly impaired, resulting in decreased sales revenue and a negative impact on our wholesaler relationships.\nAn increase in excise taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government currently levies an excise tax of $18 per barrel on beer sold for consumption in the United States; however, brewers that produce less than two million barrels annually are taxed at $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped, with the remainder of the shipments taxed at the normal rate. Individual states that we operate in also impose excise taxes on beer and other alcohol beverages in varying amounts, which have been subject to change. Federal and state legislators routinely consider various proposals to impose additional excise taxes on the production of alcoholic beverages, including beer. Any such increases in excise taxes, if enacted, would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations affecting our breweries and pubs.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of beer, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising and marketing, distributor relationships and various other matters. A variety of federal, state and local governmental authorities also levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations may cause the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau or any particular state or jurisdiction to revoke its license or permit, restricting our ability to conduct business, or result in the imposition of significant fines or penalties. One or more regulatory authorities could determine that we have not complied with applicable licensing or permitting regulations or have not maintained the approvals necessary for us to conduct business within our jurisdiction. If licenses, permits or approvals necessary for our brewery or pub operations were unavailable or unduly delayed, or if any permits or licenses that we hold were to be revoked, or additional permits or licenses were required in the future, including as a result of expanding our operations, our ability to conduct business may be disrupted, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe craft beer business is seasonal in nature, and we are likely to experience fluctuations in results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of craft beer products are somewhat seasonal, with the first and fourth quarters historically being lower and the rest of the year generating stronger sales. Our sales volume may also be affected by weather conditions and selling days within a particular period. Therefore, the results for any given quarter will likely not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. If an adverse event such as a regional economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the second and third quarters, the adverse impact to our revenues would likely be greater as a result of the seasonal business.\nWe may be unable to access public or private debt markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms, or in sufficient amounts, if at all.\nWe depend, in part, on our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (\"BofA\"), to fund our operations and commitments for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to range from $17 million to $21 million. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include general economic conditions, disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, and our financial performance or outlook, or credit. An adverse change in any or all of these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.\nIf our business does not perform as expected, including if we generate less revenue than anticipated from our operations or encounter significant unexpected costs, we may fail to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facilities. If we do not comply with our financial covenants and we do not obtain a waiver or amendment, BofA may elect to cause all amounts owed to become immediately due and payable. Any default may require us to seek additional capital or modifications to our credit facilities, which may not be available or which may be costly. Any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFailure to realize expected benefits from capital investments in our breweries and information technology may impact our operating results and cash flows.\nOver the past several years, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in improvements aimed at increasing the efficiency, capabilities and capacity of our breweries, improving our ordering and logistics systems, and enhancing the customer experience at our restaurant facilities. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits and generate adequate returns on such capital improvement projects may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAcquisitions subject us to various risks, including risks relating to selection and pricing of acquisition targets, integration of acquired companies into our business and assumption of unanticipated liabilities.\nWe have completed two acquisitions since 2008 and may pursue additional acquisitions or joint venture or investment opportunities. We cannot assure, however, that we will be able to identify or take advantage of such opportunities. If we do pursue such transactions, we may not realize the anticipated benefits. Acquisitions involve many risks, including risks relating to the assumption of unforeseen liabilities of an acquired business, adverse accounting charges resulting from the acquisition, and difficulties in integrating acquired companies into our business, both from a cultural perspective, as well as with respect to technological integration. Our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses or manage joint ventures may lead to increased costs, failure to generate expected returns, or even a total loss of amounts invested, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in state laws regarding distribution arrangements may adversely impact our operations.\nStates in which we have a significant sales presence may enact legislation that significantly alters the competitive environment for the beer distribution industry. Any change in the competitive environment in those states could have an adverse effect on our future sales and results of operations and may impact the financial stability of wholesalers on which we rely.\nWe may experience a shortage of kegs necessary to distribute draft beer.\nWe distribute our draft beer in kegs that are owned by us. During periods when we experience stronger sales, we may need to rely on kegs leased from A-B to address the additional demand. If shipments of draft beer increase, we may experience a shortage of available kegs to fill sales orders. If we cannot meet our keg requirements through either lease or purchase, we may be required to delay some draft shipments. Such delays could have an adverse impact on sales and relationships with wholesalers and A-B.\nA loss of involvement by the founders of Widmer Brothers Brewing Company in promoting that brand family could adversely affect sales.\nThe founders of Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, Kurt R. Widmer (\u201cKurt\u201d) and Robert P. Widmer (\u201cRob\u201d), are integral to our current Widmer Brothers brand family messaging and we rely on the positive public perception of their images, as founders. The role of Kurt, as founder and chairman of the board, and Rob, as founder and vice president of corporate quality assurance and industry relations, are emphasized as part of our Widmer Brothers brand communication and have appeal to some drinkers. If Kurt or Rob were not willing or able to continue in their active roles, their absence could detrimentally affect the strength of our messaging and, accordingly, our growth prospects.\nWe are dependent on certain suppliers for key raw materials, packaging materials and production inputs.\nAlthough we seek to maintain back-up and alternative suppliers for all key raw materials and production inputs, we are reliant on certain third parties for key raw materials, packaging materials and utilities. Any disruption in the willingness or ability of these third parties to supply these critical components could hinder our ability to continue production of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nViolation of federal and state environmental regulations could adversely affect our operations.\nOur brewing operations are subject to environmental regulations and local permitting requirements and agreements regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. While we have no reason to believe the operation of our breweries violates any such regulation or requirement, if such a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, we could be adversely affected.\nA small number of shareholders hold a significant ownership percentage of our common stock and uncertainty over their continuing ownership plans could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAs noted above, A-B has a significant ownership stake in us. In addition, Kurt Widmer and Rob Widmer together beneficially own approximately 2.2 million shares, or 11.6%, of our common stock. Collectively, these two groups own 43.3% of our equity. All of these shares are available for sale in the public market, subject to volume, manner of sale and other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. Such sales in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay and are limited in our ability to declare or pay dividends; accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends. Further, under our loan agreement with BofA, we are not permitted to declare or pay a dividend unless we meet certain financial covenants. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to shareholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nThe fair value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, may become impaired.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Kona Brewing Company, we have recognized a significant increase in our total intangible assets, including goodwill. As of December 31, 2014, we had $29.4 million in an assortment of intangible assets, on a net basis, which represented nearly 16.5% of our total assets. If any circumstances were to occur, such as economic recession or other factors causing a reduction in consumer demand, or for any other reason we were to experience a significant decrease in sales growth, which had a negative impact on our estimated cash flows associated with these assets, our analyses of these assets may conclude that a decrease in the fair value of these assets occurred. If this were to occur, we would be required to recognize a potentially significant loss on impairment of these assets. Any such impairment loss would be charged against current operations in the period of change.", "PERMNO": 82176, "SIC": 2082, "TIC": "BREW"}
