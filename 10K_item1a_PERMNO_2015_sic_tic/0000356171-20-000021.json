RISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of factors that may adversely affect our business, financial results, or stock price. In analyzing whether to make or continue holding an investment in the Company, investors should consider, among other factors, the following:\nRisks Related to the Nature and Geographic Area of Our Business\nWe are exposed to risks in connection with the loans we make.\nAs a lender, we face a significant risk that we will sustain losses because borrowers, guarantors or related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the loans we make or acquire. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. We have underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies, including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses, that we believe appropriately address this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance and diversifying our respective loan portfolios. Such policies and procedures, however, may not prevent\nunexpected losses that could adversely affect our results of operations. We could sustain losses if we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers or fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike other financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses would reduce our earnings and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the known risks in the current portfolio, composition and growth of the loan portfolio and economic factors. Determining an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan losses. While we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover current losses, we cannot assure you that we will not increase the allowance for loan losses further or that the allowance will be adequate to absorb loan losses we actually incur. Either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by business conditions in northern and central California.\nWe conduct most of our business in northern and central California. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results may be impacted by economic conditions in California. Deterioration in the economic conditions in California could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:\n\u2022problem assets and foreclosures may increase,\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline,\n\u2022low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease, and\n\u2022collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.\nIn view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in both northern and central California, we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of any of these consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and other external events could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and our customer base are primarily located in northern and central California where natural and other disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods, the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change. These types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies, our business and customers in these regions. Such events could also affect the stability of the Bank\u2019s deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to obtain adequate insurance or repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans and cause significant property damage, result in losses of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on our customers and in turn, on us. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios, and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant majority of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate and a downturn in our real estate markets could hurt our business.\nA downturn in our real estate markets in which we conduct our business in California could hurt our business because most of our loans are secured by real estate. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature. As real estate prices decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans is reduced. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral could then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 91.5% of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate. Substantially all of our real estate collateral is located in California. So if there is a significant adverse decline in real estate values in California, the collateral for our loans will provide less security. Real estate values could also be affected by, among other things, earthquakes, drought and national disasters in our markets. Any such downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nStrong competition in California could hurt our profits.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete. We primarily compete in northern and central California for loans, deposits and customers with commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage firms and Internet-based marketplace lending platforms. In particular, our competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions may have larger lending limits which would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies, such as Internet-based marketplace lenders, financial technology (or \u201cfintech\u201d) companies that rely on technology to provide financial services, often without many of the regulatory and capital restrictions that we face. We also face competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened loan production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nOur future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our executive officers and key personnel. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.\nOur previous results may not be indicative of our future results.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth and level of profitability or may not even be able to grow our business or continue to be profitable at all. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence and financial performance. If we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to a high percentage of our operating costs being fixed expenses.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral that we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt our businesses.\nThe economic environment and market conditions in which we operate continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including:\n\u2022inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded,\n\u2022isolationist foreign policies,\n\u2022the introduction of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or\n\u2022the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the \u201cGSEs\u201d).\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:\n\u2022erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency,\n\u2022provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations,\n\u2022increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and\n\u2022result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries.\nThese factors could lead to:\n\u2022greater market volatility,\n\u2022large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries,\n\u2022the widening or narrowing of credit spreads,\n\u2022inflationary pressures,\n\u2022lower investment growth, and\n\u2022other market dislocations.\nAdditional areas of uncertainty include, among other, geopolitical tensions and conflicts, pandemics and election outcomes. for example, it was reported in January 2020 that a novel strain of the coronavirus which first surfaced in China, had spread to other countries, resulting in various uncertainties including the potential impact to global economies, trade and consumer and corporate financial matters.\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause us to suffer losses in our investment securities portfolio, reduce our liquidity and capital levels, hamper our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and customers, and weaken our results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket and Interest Rate Risk\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability and affect the value of our assets.\nLike other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and leases and investments, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We expect that we will periodically experience imbalances in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities and the relationships of various interest rates to each other. Over any defined period of time, our interest-earning assets may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-bearing liabilities, or vice-versa. Furthermore, the individual market interest rates underlying our loan and lease and deposit products may not change to the same degree over a given time period. If market interest rates should move contrary to our position, earnings may be negatively affected. In addition, loan and lease volume and quality and deposit volume and mix can be affected by market interest rates as can the businesses of our clients. Changes in levels of market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest spread, asset quality, origination volume, the value of our loans and investment securities and overall profitability.\nMarket interest rates are beyond our control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, may negatively affect our ability to originate loans and leases, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately could affect our earnings.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nBecause of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, in turn, our profitability. In addition, loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates. Rising interest rates, generally, are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Conversely, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may decline and in falling interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may increase. Although we were successful in generating new loans during 2019, the continuation of historically low long-term interest rate levels may cause additional refinancing of commercial real estate and 1-4 family residence loans, which may depress our loan volumes or cause rates on loans to decline. In addition, an increase in the general level of short-term interest rates on variable rate loans may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations or reduce the amount they wish to borrow. Additionally, if short-term market rates rise, in order\nto retain existing deposit customers and attract new deposit customers we may need to increase rates we pay on deposit accounts. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nReduction in the value, or impairment of our investment securities, can impact our earnings and common shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe maintained a balance of $1.3 billion, or approximately 20.8% of our assets, in investment securities at December 31, 2019. Changes in market interest rates can affect the value of these investment securities, with increasing interest rates generally resulting in a reduction of value. Although the reduction in value from temporary increases in market rates does not affect our income until the security is sold, it does result in an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income that can reduce our common stockholders\u2019 equity. Further, we must periodically test our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment in value. In assessing whether the impairment of investment securities is other-than-temporary, we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021. The announcement also indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the LIBOR administrator or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable benchmark for certain financial instruments, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives on the values of the financial instruments, whose interest rates are tied to LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the elimination or replacement of LIBOR, or other reforms may adversely affect the value of, and the return on our financial instruments.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations. Any additional regulations are expect to increase our cost of operations. Furthermore, regulations may prevent or impair our ability to pay dividends, engage in acquisitions or operate in other ways.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the DBO, FDIC, and the FRB. See Item 1 - Regulation and Supervision of this report for information on the regulation and supervision which governs our activities. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Banking regulations, designed primarily for the protection of depositors, may limit our growth and the return to our shareholders by restricting certain of our activities, such as:\n\u2022the payment of dividends to our shareholders,\n\u2022possible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other institutions,\n\u2022desired investments,\n\u2022loans and interest rates on loans,\n\u2022interest rates paid on deposits,\n\u2022service charges on deposit account transactions,\n\u2022the possible expansion of branch offices, and\n\u2022the ability to provide securities or trust services.\nWe also are subject to regulatory capital requirements. We could be subject to regulatory enforcement actions if, any of our regulators determines for example, that we have violated a law of regulation, engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practice or lack adequate capital. Federal and state governments and regulators could pass legislation and adopt policies responsive to current credit conditions that would have an adverse effect on us and our financial performance. We cannot predict what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our operations, including the cost to conduct business.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional risks and expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new SEC regulations, are creating additional expense for publicly-traded companies such as the Company. The application of these laws, regulations and standards may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing\nbodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding management\u2019s required assessment of its internal control over financial reporting and our external auditors\u2019 audit of our internal control over financial reporting requires, and will continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Further, the members of our board of directors, members of our audit or compensation and management succession committees, our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer and certain other executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. It may also become more difficult and more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, our ability to attract and retain executive officers and qualified board and committee members could be more difficult. members could be more difficult.\nTax regulations could be subject to potential legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations.\nFederal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified and/or modified by legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time. Any such changes could adversely affect us, either directly, or indirectly as a result of effects on our customers. For example, the tax reform bill enacted on December 22, 2017 has had, and is expected to continue to have, far-reaching and significant effects on us, our customers and the U.S. economy.\nRisks Related to Growth and Expansion\nGoodwill resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets have increased substantially as a result of our acquisitions of FNB Bancorp in 2018 and North Valley Bancorp in 2014. Potential impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment annually and more frequently when required by U.S. GAAP. We are required to record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their fair values. Our assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets could indicate that an impairment of the carrying value of such assets may have occurred that could result in a material, non-cash write-down of such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future earnings.\nIf we cannot attract deposits, our growth may be inhibited.\nWe plan to increase the level of our assets, including our loan portfolio. Our ability to increase our assets depends in large part on our ability to attract additional deposits at favorable rates. We intend to seek additional deposits by offering deposit products that are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our markets and by establishing personal relationships with our customers. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to attract additional deposits at competitive rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPotential acquisitions create risks and may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe intend to continue to explore opportunities for growth through mergers and acquisitions. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022incurring substantial expenses in pursuing potential acquisitions without completing such acquisitions,\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company,\n\u2022losing key clients as a result of the change of ownership,\n\u2022the acquired business not performing in accordance with our expectations,\n\u2022difficulties and expenses arising in connection with the integration of the operations of the acquired business with our operations,\n\u2022difficulty in estimating the value of the target company,\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company,\n\u2022management needing to divert attention from other aspects of our business,\n\u2022potentially losing key employees of the acquired business,\n\u2022incurring unanticipated costs which could reduce our earnings per share,\n\u2022assuming potential liabilities of the acquired company as a result of the acquisition,\n\u2022potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company,\n\u2022potential disruption to our business, and\n\u2022an acquisition may dilute our earnings per share, in both the short and long term, or it may reduce our tangible capital ratios\nOur growth and expansion may strain our ability to manage our operations and our financial resources.\nOur financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy. In addition to seeking deposit and loan and lease growth in our existing markets, we may pursue expansion opportunities in new markets. Continued growth, however, may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced.\nOur growth may place a strain on our administrative, operational and financial resources and increase demands on our systems and controls. This business growth may require continued enhancements to and expansion of our operating and financial systems and controls and may strain or significantly challenge them. In addition, our existing operating and financial control systems and infrastructure may not be adequate to maintain and effectively monitor future growth. Our continued growth may also increase our need for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, integrating and retaining such personnel.\nRisks Relating to Dividends and Our Common Stock\nOur future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is limited by California law and the policies and regulations of the FRB. The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the FRB\u2019s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions.\u201d\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the Bank, our ability to continue to pay dividends depends in large part upon the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to us is subject to the restrictions in the California Financial Code.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our shareholder and the ability of the Bank to pay in dividends to us are by the requirements that the we and the Bank maintain a certain minimum amount of capital to be considered a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution as well as a separate capital conservation buffer, as further described under \u201cItem 1 - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Requirements\u201d in this report.\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or the Bank from declaring or paying dividends. Our holding company expenses and obligations with respect to our trust preferred securities and corresponding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by us may limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends.\nAnti-takeover provisions and federal law may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nVarious provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions provide for, among other things, specified actions that the Board of Directors shall or may take when an offer to merge, an offer to acquire all assets or a tender offer is received and the authority to issue preferred stock by action of the board of directors acting alone, without obtaining shareholder approval.\nThe BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either FRB approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the FRB and not disapproved prior to any person or entity acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of a bank holding company such as TriCo. These provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to shareholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nThe amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, our officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose.\nAs of December 31, 2019, directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 8.7% of our common stock and our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d) owned approximately 3.8%. Agreements with our senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock beneficially owned by our board of directors, management, and the ESOP, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals of us that our directors and officers oppose.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, or to fund future growth, our board of directors may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of our common stock. The sale of these shares may significantly dilute your ownership interest as a shareholder. New investors in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders which may adversely impact our current shareholders.\nHolders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders.\nWe have supported our growth through the prior issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures with face value of $62,889,000. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures we issued to the trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before we can pay any dividends on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Systems, Accounting and Internal Controls\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal and disclosure controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We continually review and analyze our internal control over financial reporting for Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. As part of that process we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control as defined under standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that require remediation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for the oversight of the Company\u2019s financial reporting.\nAs a result of weaknesses that may be identified in our internal controls, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we discover weaknesses, we will make efforts to improve our internal and disclosure controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect our ability to remain listed with Nasdaq. Ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. In particular, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has issued a new accounting standard, Current Expected Credit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d), for the recognition and measurement of credit losses for loans and debt securities. The new standard will be effective for TriCo in the first quarter 2020. Based on the modeling completed by management, the total allowance for loan losses will increase from $30,616,000 to approximately $42,000,000 to $50,000,000, or an increase of $11,384,000 to $19,384,000. The estimated decline in equity, net of tax, will range from $8,020,000 to $13,655,000. This estimate is influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of the loan portfolio, as well as the economic conditions and forecasts as of each reporting period. These economic conditions and forecasts could be significantly different in future periods. The impact of the change in the allowance on our results of operations in a provision for credit losses will depend on the current period net charge-offs, level of loan originations, and change in mix of the loan portfolio. The ranges noted above exclude any impact to the Company's reserve for unfunded commitments, which management does not believe the adoption of CECL will have a significant impact.\nA failure or breach, including cyber-attacks, of our operational or security systems, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that our security measures will provide absolute security. Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. In fact, many other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks, and other means. Certain financial institutions in the United States have also experienced attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to\ncustomers for extended periods. These \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks have not breached our data security systems, but require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We have implemented employee and customer awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nIf our security systems were penetrated or circumvented, it could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage our computers or systems and those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe rely on third party vendors, which could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, including certain data processing and information services. On our behalf, third parties may transmit confidential, propriety information. Although we require third party providers to maintain certain levels of information security, such providers may remain vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information. While we may contractually limit our liability in connection with attacks against third party providers, we remain exposed to the risk of loss associated with such vendors.\nIn addition, a number of our vendors are large national entities with dominant market presence in their respective fields. Their services could prove difficult to replace in a timely manner if a failure or other service interruption were to occur. Failures of certain vendors to provide contracted services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur significant expense.\nOur business is highly reliant on technology and our ability and our third party service providers to manage the operational risks associated with technology.\nOur business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and business customer data. We depend on internal systems, third party service providers, and outsourced technology to support these data storage and processing operations. Despite our efforts to ensure the security and integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or those of third party service providers or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyber security breaches. Cyberattack techniques change regularly and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments, and such third parties may seek to gain access to systems directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile and other internet-based product offerings and expands our internal usage of web-based products and applications. A cyber security breach or cyberattack could persist for a long time before being detected and could result in theft of sensitive data or disruption of our transaction processing systems.\nOur inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. A material breach of customer data security may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers, result in increased expense to contain the event and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers, result in regulatory fines and sanctions and/or result in litigation. Cyber security risk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect us from all risks associated with maintaining the security of customer data and our proprietary data from external and internal intrusions, disaster recovery and failures in the controls used by our vendors.\nCybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.\nAs cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including TriCo and its bank subsidiary, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data. For more information regarding cybersecurity regulation, refer to the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of this report.\nWe receive, maintain and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and\nregulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled. For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the CCPA. The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds, including TriCo. For more information regarding data privacy regulation, refer to the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of this report.\nWe may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results. In addition, any additional laws will result in increased compliance costs.\nA failure to implement technological advances could negatively impact our business.\nThe banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers. In addition, advances in technology such as digital, mobile, telephone, text, and on-line banking; e-commerce; and self-service automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences to access our products and services through digital channels, could decrease the value of our store network and other assets. We may close or sell certain branches and restructure or reduce our remaining branches and work force. These actions could lead to losses on assets, expense to reconfigure branches and loss of customers in certain markets. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 79116, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TCBK"}
