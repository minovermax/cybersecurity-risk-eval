If we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate increases, or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to cover our investments in utility plant and equipment and projected expenses, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers, which are subject to approval by the PPUC. We file rate increase requests with the PPUC, from time to time, to recover our investments in utility plant and equipment and projected expenses. Any rate increase or adjustment must first be justified through documented evidence and testimony. The PPUC determines whether the investments and expenses are recoverable, the length of time over which such costs are recoverable, or, because of changes in circumstances, whether a remaining balance of deferred investments and expenses is no longer recoverable in rates charged to customers. Once a rate increase application is filed with the PPUC, the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The timing of our rate increase requests are therefore dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase. In addition, the amount or frequency of rate increases may be decreased or lengthened as a result of changes in income tax laws regarding tax-basis depreciation as it applies to our capital expenditures or qualifying repair tax deductible expenditures.\nWe can provide no assurances that future requests will be approved by the PPUC; and, if approved, we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we sought the rate increase. If we are unable to obtain PPUC approval of our requests for rate increases, or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to cover our investments in utility plant and equipment and projected expenses, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulation that may impose costly limitations and restrictions on the way we do business.\nVarious federal, state and local authorities regulate many aspects of our business. Among the most important of these regulations are those relating to the quality of water we supply our customers, water allocation rights and the quality of the effluent we discharge from our wastewater treatment facility. Government authorities continually review these regulations, particularly the drinking water quality regulations, and may propose new or more restrictive requirements in the future. We are required to perform water and wastewater quality tests that are monitored by the PPUC, the EPA, and the DEP, for the detection of certain chemicals and compounds in our water and effluent. If new or more restrictive limitations on permissible levels of substances and contaminants in our water and wastewater are imposed, we may not be able to adequately predict the costs necessary to meet regulatory standards. If we are unable to recover the cost of implementing new water and wastewater treatment procedures in response to more restrictive quality regulations through our rates that we charge our customers, or if we fail to comply with such regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to water allocation regulations that control the amount of water that we can draw from water sources. The SRBC and the DEP regulate the amount of water withdrawn from streams in the watershed for water supply purposes to assure that sufficient quantities are available to meet our needs and the needs of other regulated users. In addition, government drought restrictions could cause the SRBC or the DEP to temporarily reduce the amount of our allocations. If new or more restrictive water allocation regulations are implemented or our allocations are reduced due to weather conditions, it may have an adverse effect on our ability to supply the demands of our customers, and in turn, on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect demand for our water service and our revenues.\nDemand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with cooling systems, swimming pools, irrigation systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected, or there is more rainfall than expected, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.\nWeather conditions and overuse may interfere with our sources of water, demand for water services, and our ability to supply water to our customers.\nWe depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers and to continue our expansion efforts. Unexpected conditions may interfere with our water supply sources. Drought and overuse may limit the availability of surface and ground water. These factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. Additionally, cool and wet weather, as well as drought restrictions and our customers' conservation efforts, may reduce consumption demands, also adversely affecting our revenue and earnings. Furthermore, freezing weather may also contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and main breakage. If we experience an interruption in our water supply, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future, possibly created by the climate change greenhouse gases. Changing severe weather patterns could require additional expenditures to reduce the risk associated with any increasing storm, flood and drought occurrences.\nThe issue of climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide. Many climate change predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, such as increased frequency and duration of droughts, increased precipitation and flooding, potential degradation of water quality, and changes in demand for services. The changes may result in lower revenue, the need for additional capital expenditures, or increased costs. Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate change, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Although any potential expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that the PPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with any climate change related measures will not harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA general economic downturn may lead to a number of impacts on our business that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such impacts may include: a reduction in discretionary and recreational water use by our residential water customers, particularly during the summer months when such discretionary usage is normally at its highest; a decline in usage by industrial and commercial customers as a result of decreased business activity; an increased incidence of customers' inability to pay or delays in paying their utility bills, or an increase in customer bankruptcies, which may lead to higher bad debt expense and reduced cash flow; a lower customer growth rate due to a decline in new housing starts; and a decline in the number of active customers due to housing vacancies or abandonments. A deterioration in general economic conditions may also lead to an investment market downturn, which may result in our pension plans' asset market values suffering a decline and significant volatility. A decline in our pension plans' asset market values could increase our required cash contributions to these plans and pension expense in subsequent years.\nThe current concentration of our business in central and southern Pennsylvania makes us particularly susceptible to adverse developments in local economic and demographic conditions.\nOur service territory presently includes 39 municipalities within York County, Pennsylvania and nine municipalities within Adams County, Pennsylvania. Our revenues and operating results are therefore especially subject to local economic and demographic conditions in the area. A change in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business. In addition, any such change would have a disproportionate effect on us, compared to water and wastewater utility companies that do not have such a geographic concentration.\nContamination of our water supply may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues.\nOur water supply is subject to contamination from the migration of naturally-occurring substances in groundwater and surface systems and pollution resulting from man-made sources. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source through our interconnected transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods. Our inability to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, may have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nIf our sources of water or water at customer sites become contaminated, it could subject us to reduction in usage, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation.\nAs described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Environmental Matters\", during our recently completed triennial testing, we determined that we exceeded the action level for lead in rules issued by the EPA. The Company is operating under a consent order agreement with the DEP to address the test results, including replacing all company-owned lead service lines in the next four years. While we believe that our response has been appropriate, we may incur significant costs in responding to this incident and may not be able to recover such costs through rates or from insurers.\nOur primary business is to impound, purify to meet or exceed safe drinking water standards and distribute water. Contamination of the water provided to our customers exposes us to risks, including regulatory or government action, customer exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water, and resulting private claims and litigation. Negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not responsible for any contamination or its consequences. Pending or future claims against us and reputational damage could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe necessity for increased security has and may continue to result in increased operating costs.\nWe have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. We are not aware of any specific threats to our facilities, operations or supplies. However, it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of such events should they occur.\nThe growing dependence on digital technology has increased the risks related to cybersecurity.\nComputers and the Internet have led to increased productivity and improved customer service. Unfortunately, progress in this area has brought with it cybersecurity risks. Recently, the frequency and severity of cyber-attacks on companies has increased resulting in a disruption to business operations and the corruption or misappropriation of proprietary data. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our information technology. However, if such an attack was to occur and could not be prevented, customer information could be misappropriated, our networks may be down for an extended period of time disrupting our business, and it could require costly replacement of hardware and software. We carry cyber liability insurance, however, our limits may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities.\nWe depend on the availability of capital for expansion, construction and maintenance.\nOur ability to continue our expansion efforts and fund our construction and maintenance program depends on the availability of adequate capital. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital in the future or that the cost of capital will not be too high for future expansion and construction. In addition, approval from the PPUC must be obtained prior to our sale and issuance of securities. If we are unable to obtain approval from the PPUC on these matters, or to obtain approval in a timely manner, it may affect our ability to effect transactions that are beneficial to us or our shareholders. A single transaction may itself not be profitable but might still be necessary to continue providing service or to grow the business.\nThe failure to maintain our existing credit rating could affect our cost of funds and related liquidity.\nStandard & Poor's Ratings Services rates our outstanding debt and has given a credit rating to us. Their evaluations are based on a number of factors, which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. Failure to maintain our current credit rating could adversely affect our cost of funds and related liquidity.\nWe may face competition from other water suppliers or wastewater service providers that may hinder our growth and reduce our profitability.\nWe face competition from other water suppliers for acquisitions, which may limit our growth opportunities. Furthermore, even after we have been the successful bidder in an acquisition, competing water suppliers or wastewater service providers may challenge our application for extending our franchise territory to cover the target company's market. Finally, third parties either supplying water on a contract basis to municipalities or entering into agreements to operate municipal water or wastewater systems might adversely affect our business by winning contracts that may be beneficial to us. If we are unable to compete successfully with other water suppliers and wastewater service providers for these acquisitions, franchise territories and contracts, it may impede our expansion goals and adversely affect our profitability.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Any pending or future acquisitions we decide to undertake will involve risks.\nThe acquisition and integration of water and wastewater systems is an important element in our growth strategy. This strategy depends on identifying suitable acquisition opportunities and reaching mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs. Further, acquisitions may result in dilution for the owners of our common stock, our incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and fluctuations in quarterly results. In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the financial results that we expect, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe have restrictions on our dividends. There can also be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nThe terms of our debt instruments impose conditions on our ability to pay dividends. We have paid dividends on our common stock each year since our inception in 1816 and have increased the amount of dividends paid each year since 1997. Our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, applicable regulations and other factors, including the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases, will determine both our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and the amount of those dividends. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nIf we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents, our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance. Our performance is affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We believe that our cash generated from operations, and, if necessary, borrowings under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due. If, however, we do not generate sufficient cash, we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity, which may be on terms that are not as favorable to us. No assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default under these documents, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nWe depend significantly on the services of the members of our senior management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our senior management team. If we lose the services of any member of our senior management or are unable to hire and retain experienced management personnel, our operating results could suffer.\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.\nApproximately one-third of our workforce is unionized under a contract with a labor union. In light of rising costs for healthcare and retirement benefits, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor actions as we negotiate with the union to address these issues, which could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we believe we have a good relationship with our union workforce and have a strike contingency plan, we cannot be assured that issues with our labor force will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock; you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for them.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading in our common stock has substantially less liquidity than many other companies quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Because of the limited volume of trading in our common stock, a sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the open market could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, either of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur water system includes two impounding dams. While we maintain robust dam maintenance and inspection programs, a failure of the dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We carry liability insurance on our dams, however, our limits may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams. The estimated costs to maintain and upgrade our dams are included in our capital budget. Although such costs have previously been recoverable in rates, there is no guarantee that these costs will continue to be recoverable and in what magnitude they will be recoverable.\nWastewater operations entail significant risks and may impose significant costs.\nWastewater collection and treatment and septage pumping and sludge hauling involve various unique risks. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, or if there is a spill, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing various damages and injuries, including environmental damage. These risks are most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damages and injuries could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provision.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. The calculation of the provision for income taxes is subject to our interpretation of applicable business tax laws in the federal and state jurisdictions in which we file. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other taxing authorities. In December 2014, we changed our tax method of accounting to permit the expensing of qualifying asset improvement costs that were previously being capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes. Our determination of what qualifies as a capital cost versus a repair expense tax deduction is subject to subsequent adjustment and may impact the income tax benefits that have been recognized. Although we believe our income tax estimates are appropriate, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different, either higher or lower, from what is reflected in our income tax provision. In the event we are assessed additional income taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to market and interest rate risk on our $12,000,000 variable interest rate debt issue.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in conjunction with our $12,000,000 variable interest rate debt issue. This exposure, however, has been hedged with an interest rate swap. This hedge will protect the Company from the risk of changes in the benchmark interest rates, but does not protect the Company's exposure to the changes in the difference between its own variable funding rate and the benchmark rate. A breakdown of the historical relationships between the cost of funds of the Company and the benchmark rate underlying the interest rate swap could result in higher interest rates adversely affecting our financial results.\nThe holders of the $12,000,000 variable rate Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority (PEDFA) Series A Bonds may tender their bonds at any time. When the bonds are tendered, they are subject to an annual remarketing agreement, pursuant to which a remarketing agent attempts to remarket the tendered bonds pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. In order to keep variable interest rates down and to enhance the marketability of the Series A Bonds, the Company entered into a Reimbursement, Credit and Security Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (\"the Bank\") dated as of May 1, 2008. This agreement provides for a direct pay letter of credit issued by the Bank to the trustee for the Series A Bonds. The letter of credit expires June 30, 2018 and is reviewed annually for a potential extension of the expiration date. The Bank is responsible for providing the trustee with funds for the timely payment of the principal and interest on the Series A Bonds and for the purchase price of the Series A Bonds that have been tendered or deemed tendered for purchase and have not been remarketed. If the Bank is unable to meet its obligations, the Company would be required to buy any bonds which had been tendered.", "PERMNO": 88857, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "YORW"}
