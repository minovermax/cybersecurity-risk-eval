RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Investors or potential investors in our stock should carefully consider the risks described below.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have not yet achieved annual positive cash flows.\nOur net cash used in operating activities was $3.8 million in 2015 and $10.1 million in 2014. We may not be able to achieve revenue growth, profitability or positive cash flow, on either a quarterly or annual basis, and that profitability, if achieved, may not be sustained. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, we may not be financially viable in the future and may have to curtail, suspend, or cease operations, restructure existing operations to attempt to ensure future viability, or pursue other alternatives such as re-filing for bankruptcy, pursuing dissolution and liquidation, seeking to merge with another company, selling all or substantially all of our assets or raising additional capital through equity or debt financings. Because of our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations, the audit report of our independent registered public accountants on our consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have generated significant losses since our inception in 2000, and losses in the future could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due and on our cash flows.\nSince we began operations in February 2000, we have incurred an accumulated deficit in excess of $250 million. We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations if achieved. If our losses continue, our liquidity may continue to be severely impaired, our stock price may fall and our shareholders may lose all or a significant portion of their investment. If we are not able to attain profitability in the near future our financial condition could deteriorate further which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment. Further, we may be unable to pay our debt obligations as they become due, which include obligations to secured creditors.\nIndex\nWe may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings in the future to achieve our business objectives and to satisfy our cash obligations, which would dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders and possibly subordinate certain of their rights to the rights of new investors.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings in order to complete our ultimate business objectives. We also may choose to raise additional funds in debt or equity financings if they are available to us on reasonable terms to increase our working capital, strengthen our financial position or to make acquisitions. Our board of directors has the ability, without seeking shareholder approval, to issue convertible debt and additional shares of common stock or preferred stock that is convertible into common stock for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient, which may be at a discount to the market price. Any sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing shareholders, which could be substantial. Additionally, if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds, the holders of those securities might be entitled to various preferential rights over the holders of our common stock, including repayment of their investment, and possibly additional amounts, before any payments could be made to holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition of us. Such preferred shares, if authorized, might be granted rights and preferences that would be senior to, or otherwise adversely affect, the rights and the value of our common stock. Also, new investors may require that we and certain of our shareholders enter into voting arrangements that give them additional voting control or representation on our board of directors.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal control over financing reporting in the future could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nAny future failure to remedy deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that may be discovered or our failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective. Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price. Furthermore, deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including review by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nThere are significant market risks associated with our business.\nWe have formulated our business plan and strategies based on certain assumptions regarding the size of the rice bran market, our anticipated share of this market, the estimated price and acceptance of our products and other factors. These assumptions are based on our best estimates, however our assessments may not prove to be correct. Any future success may depend upon factors including changes in the dietary supplement industry, governmental regulation, increased levels of competition, including the entry of additional competitors and increased success by existing competitors, changes in general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including costs of rice bran, production, supplies, personnel, equipment, and reduced margins caused by competitive pressures. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nWe may face difficulties integrating businesses we acquire.\nAs part of our strategy, we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies, such as the acquisition of HN that was completed on January 2, 2014, that would complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance technical capabilities, or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities. Such acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products;\n\u2022 unanticipated costs;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations;\n\u2022 problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products;\n\u2022 unanticipated costs;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations.\nIndex\nWe have significant foreign operations and there are inherent risks in operating overseas.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to build and operate rice bran stabilization and rice bran oil facilities in foreign countries and to market and sell our products internationally. For example, we have an operation in Brazil which manufactures rice bran oil. There are risks in operating facilities in foreign countries because, among other reasons, we may be unable to attract sufficient qualified personnel, intellectual property rights may not be enforced as we expect, and legal rights may not be available as contemplated. Should any of these risks occur, our ability to expand our foreign operations may be materially limited and we may be unable to maximize the output from these facilities and our financial results may decrease from our anticipated levels. The inherent risks of international operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include, among others:\n\u2022 cultural differences in the conduct of business;\n\u2022 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022 greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022 challenges in obtaining and maintaining financing;\n\u2022 impact of recessions in economies outside of the United States;\n\u2022 reduced or obtainable protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022 political conditions in each country;\n\u2022 management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries;\n\u2022 the burden and administrative costs of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws; and\n\u2022 currency restrictions.\nBrazilian economic, political and other conditions, and Brazilian government policies or actions in response to these conditions, may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Brazilian economy has historically been characterized by interventions by the Brazilian government and unstable economic cycles. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the course of Brazil\u2019s economy. For example, the government\u2019s actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls, blocking access to bank accounts, imposing exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil. In addition, periodically there are disruptions related to national transportation strikes, like those occurring in February 2015, which may limit Irgovel\u2019s ability to receive raw rice bran and ship products to customers. We have no control over, and cannot predict, what policies or actions the Brazilian government may take in the future.\nOur Brazilian segment\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected by, among others, the following factors:\n\u2022 exchange rate movements;\n\u2022 exchange control policies;\n\u2022 expansion or contraction of the Brazilian economy, as measured by rates of growth in GDP;\n\u2022 inflation;\n\u2022 tax policies;\n\u2022 other economic political, diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Brazil;\n\u2022 interest rates;\n\u2022 energy shortages;\n\u2022 liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets;\n\u2022 changes in environmental regulation; and\n\u2022 social and political instability.\nIrgovel has certain financial and operating performance obligations which if not met may lead to us losing management control over Irgovel.\nUnder the terms of our agreements with the Investors, Irgovel must meet certain minimum annual processing targets and must achieve EBITDA in the local currency of at least R$4.0 million. At the end of 2015, Irgovel did not meet this covenant but Investors waived the requirement. If Irgovel fails to meet these financial requirements, we could lose management control over Irgovel\u2019s operations, and management control would transfer to the other investors in Nutra SA. Any such change in management control would cause us to no longer consolidate Irgovel\u2019s financial results with our financial results. Instead, we would be required to account for Irgovel as an equity investment on our balance sheets which may negatively impact our share price.\nIndex\nOur business could be affected adversely by labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages in Brazil.\nAll of the employees at our Irgovel facility in Brazil are represented by a labor union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As a result, we are subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. Our collective bargaining agreement in Brazil has a one-year term and requires that we provide wage adjustments each year. We may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future. We could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenues and net income.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including primarily the Brazilian Real. Currently, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses occur in our Brazilian subsidiary, Irgovel. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect historically, during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Brazilian Real and any other currency which affects a material amount of our operations, will affect our revenues, cost of sales, gross profit (loss), operating expenses, or other income and expenses and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. These fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Disruptions in financial markets may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates in relatively short periods of time which further increases the risk of an adverse currency effect. Since we plan to expand our international operations, we will likely increase our exposure to foreign currency risks. We do not hedge our currency risk, and do not expect to, as currency hedges are expensive and do not necessarily reduce the risk of currency fluctuations over longer periods of time.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers.\nIn the USA segment, in 2015, three customers accounted for 63% of segment revenues and the top ten customers accounted for 78% of segment revenues. As of December 31, 2015, the customers with the highest ten balances in the USA segment accounted for 55% of segment accounts receivable.\nIn the Brazil segment, in 2015, three customers accounted for 40% of segment revenues and the top ten customers accounted for 61% of segment revenues. As of December 31, 2015, the customers with the highest ten balances accounted for 84% of Brazil segment accounts receivable.\nWe are dependent upon the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues. Consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. A significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe currently depend on a limited number of customers. This results in a concentration of credit risk with respect to our outstanding accounts receivable. We consider the financial strength of the customer, the remoteness of the possible risk that a default event will occur, the potential benefits to our future growth and development, possible actions to reduce the likelihood of a default event and the benefits from the transaction before entering into a large credit limit for a customer. Although we analyze these factors, the ultimate collection of the obligation from the customer may not occur. Although we continue to expand our customer base in an attempt to mitigate the concentration of credit risk, the writing off of an accounts receivable balance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Historically, we have not experienced any loss of our cash and cash equivalents, but we have experienced losses to our trade receivables.\nIndex\nWe may encounter difficulties in maintaining relationships with distributors and customers while enforcing our credit policies.\nWe define credit risk as the risk of loss from obligors or counterparty default. Our credit risks arise from both distributors and consumers. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Our ability to forecast future trends and spot shifts in consumer patterns or behavior even before they occur are vital for success in today\u2019s economy. In managing risk, our objective is to protect our profitability, but also to protect, to the extent we can, our ongoing relationships with our distributors and customers. However, as part of our credit risk policies, we occasionally must, among other things, cancel, reduce credit limits and place cash only requirements for certain questionable accounts. These credit risk policies may negatively impact our relationships with our distributors and customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely upon a limited number of product offerings.\nThe majority of the products that we have sold through December 31, 2015, have been based on SRB produced at our U.S. facilities and RBO extracted at Irgovel. A decline in the market demand for our SRB and RBO products or the products of other companies utilizing our SRB and RBO products, would have a significant adverse impact on us.\nOur ability to generate sales is dependent upon our ability to continue our ongoing marketing efforts to raise awareness of our products and benefits of rice bran products generally.\nWe are dependent on our ability to market products to animal food producers, food manufacturers, mass merchandisers and health food retailers, and to other companies for use in their products. We must increase the level of awareness of functional foods in general and our products in particular. We will be required to devote substantial management and financial resources to these marketing and advertising efforts and such efforts may not be successful.\nOur ability to adapt to sudden increases in demand of our product is limited by an adequate supply of raw rice bran and our ability to find additional facilities for production.\nMany of our current products depend on our proprietary technology using raw rice bran, which is a by-product from milling paddy rice to white rice. Our ability to manufacture SRB is currently limited to the production capability of our equipment located at our two suppliers\u2019 rice mills in California and our own plant located adjacent to our supplier in Mermentau, Louisiana. At the facilities and our value-added product plants in Dillon, Montana and our facility in Pelotas, Brazil, we currently are capable of producing enough finished products to meet current demand. If demand for our products were to increase dramatically in the future, we would need additional production capacity which may take time and may expose us to additional long term operating costs.\nWe may not be able to continue to secure adequate sources of raw rice bran to meet our future demand. Since rice bran has a limited shelf life, the supply of rice bran is affected by the amount of rice planted and harvested each year.\nAdverse economic or weather conditions may impact our supply of raw rice bran.\nIf economic or weather conditions, for example the current drought in California, adversely affect the amount of rice planted or harvested, the cost of rice bran products that we use may increase. We are not always able to immediately pass cost increases to our customers and any increase in the cost of SRB products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face competition from other companies that produce bran, grains and other alternative ingredients with similar benefits as our rice brans.\nCompetition in our targeted industries, including nutraceuticals, functional food ingredients, rice bran oils, animal feed supplements and companion pet food ingredients is vigorous, with a large number of businesses engaged in the various industries. Many of our competitors have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing their products, including products that incorporate bran from other cereal grains and other alternative ingredients that are widely recognized as providing similar benefits as rice bran. In addition, many of our competitors have greater financial, managerial, and technical resources than we do. If we are not successful in competing in these markets, we may not be able to attain our business objectives.\nIndex\nWe must comply with our contractual obligations.\nWe have numerous ongoing contractual obligations under various purchase, sale, supply, production and other agreements which govern our business operations. We also have contractual obligations which require ongoing payments such as various debt agreements and lease obligations and the agreement of Irgovel to pay tax obligations to the Brazilian government. While we seek to comply at all times with these obligations, we may not be able to comply with the terms of all contracts during all periods of time, especially if there are significant changes in market conditions or our financial condition. If we are unable to comply with our material contractual obligations, there likely would be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints both domestically and abroad and our failure to comply with these laws, regulations and constraints could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIn both the U.S. and foreign markets, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our products are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. The dietary supplement and cosmetic industries are subject to considerable government regulation, both as to efficacy as well as labeling and advertising. We are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), state and local authorities and foreign governmental agencies including the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of sales revenues. Our failure to comply with these current and new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims, limit the production or marketing of any non-compliant products or advertising and could negatively impact our business.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls.\nWe sell food and nutritional products for animal and human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering and other adulteration of food products. We may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We maintain a product liability policy for $5.0 million per year in the aggregate. In addition, we may voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful, there may be negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury which could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers.\nMany of the risks of our business have only limited insurance coverage and many of our business risks are uninsurable.\nOur business operations are subject to potential product liability, environmental, fire, employee, manufacturing, shipping and other risks. Although we have insurance to cover some of these risks, the amount of this insurance is limited and includes numerous exceptions and limitations to coverage. In the event we were to suffer a significant uninsured claim, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, enforce and protect our patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights for our products and technology.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to protect and enforce the patents, trade secrets and trademarks that we have and to develop and obtain new patents and trademarks for future processes, machinery, compounds and products that we develop. The process of seeking patent protection may be long and expensive, and patents might not be issued or not be broad enough in scope. We may not be able to protect our technology adequately, and our competition may be able to develop similar technology that does not infringe or encroach upon any of our rights.\nIndex\nThere currently are no claims or lawsuits pending or threatened against us regarding possible infringement claims, but infringement claims by third parties, or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims, could be asserted in the future or that such assertions, if proven to be accurate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the future, litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts and other resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adverse determinations in any litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights, subjecting us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our systems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights might not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe are dependent on key employees.\nOur success depends upon the efforts of our top management team and certain other key employees, including the efforts of John Short (chief executive officer), Dale Belt (chief financial officer), Mark McKnight (senior vice president sales) and Robert Smith, PhD (senior vice president of operations and R&D). Although we have written employment agreements with our CEO and CFO and senior vice president of sales, such individuals could die, become disabled, or resign. In addition, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key management persons for positions relating to the marketing and distribution of our products. We may not be able to recruit and employ such executives at times and on terms acceptable to us. Also, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price and changes in our overall compensation program, including our equity incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain such key employees.\nCompliance with corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and other regulations issued by the SEC, such as Dodd-Frank, are creating uncertainty for companies. In order to comply with these laws, we may need to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment would result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nOur officers and directors have limited liability and have indemnification rights.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that we may indemnify our officers and directors against losses sustained or liabilities incurred which arise from any transaction in that officer\u2019s or director\u2019s respective managerial capacity, unless that officer or director violates a duty of loyalty, did not act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated the law, approved an improper dividend, or derived an improper benefit from the transaction.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The market price of the common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 announcements of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022 developments in our relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain financing;\n\u2022 the loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees;\n\u2022 announcements of technological innovations or new systems or enhancements used by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 developments in our or our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 adverse effects to our operating results due to impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022 failure to meet the expectation of securities analysts\u2019 or the public;\n\u2022 general economic and market conditions;\n\u2022 our ability to expand our operations, domestically and internationally;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of expenditures related to any expansion;\n\u2022 litigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in expectations by investors or analysts regarding our performance; and\n\u2022 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time.\nIndex\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Our stock price is volatile and we have been the target of shareholder litigation. Any shareholder litigation brought against us in the future could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nWe have significant \u201cequity overhang\u201d which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nAs of March 30, 2016, we had 10,487,415 shares of common stock outstanding, 11,199,192 shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants and 2,000,000 shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of preferred stock. The possibility that substantial amounts of our common stock may be sold by investors or the perception that such sales could occur, often called \u201cequity overhang,\u201d could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future. The issuance of the additional shares upon an increase in our authorized shares of common stock would significantly increase the amount of our common stock outstanding and the amount of the equity overhang.\nThe impacts of anti-dilution provisions in certain warrants may dilute current shareholders.\nAs of March 30, 2016, we had 1,489,867 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of two outstanding warrants that contain anti-dilution provisions, with a current exercise price of $1.50 per share. These anti-dilution provisions cause the exercise prices and conversion prices of the warrants to decrease automatically if we issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock at prices below the exercise price of these warrants. As of March 30, 2016, we also had 300,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of an outstanding warrant that contains a most favored nations anti-dilution provision, with a current exercise price of $5.25 per share. The most favored nations anti-dilution provision in this warrant provides that in the event of issuances of options and/or convertible instruments with anti-dilution provisions (providing for the adjustment of the exercise price, conversion price or other price or rate at which shares of common stock thereunder may be purchased, acquired or converted, and/or any upward adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable) we may be required to lower the exercise price on this warrant and and/or increase the number of shares underlying this warrant Any adjustments pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of these three warrants could materially dilute the holders of our common stock.\nThe authorization and issuance of preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur board of directors, without further action or vote by holders of our common stock, has the right to establish the terms, preference, rights and restrictions and issue shares of preferred stock. The terms of any series of preferred stock could be issued with terms, rights, preferences and restrictions that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock and thereby reduce the value of our common stock. The designation and issuance of preferred stock favorable to current management or shareholders could make it more difficult to gain control of our board of directors or remove our current management and may be used to defeat hostile bids for control which might provide shareholders with premiums for their shares. We have designated and issued five series of preferred stock, no shares of which remain outstanding and designated and issued a sixth series of preferred stock, Series F, in February 2016. We may issue additional series of preferred stock in the future.\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could be delisted.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cRIBT\u201d, and we also have outstanding warrants listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cRIBTW\u201d. For our common stock and warrants to continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we must meet the current NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing requirements. If we were unable to meet these requirements, including, but not limited to, requirements to obtain shareholder approval of a transaction other than a public offering involving the sale or issuance equal to 20% or more of our common stock at a price that is less than the market value of our common stock, our common stock and warrants could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market. If our securities were to be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could continue to trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board following any delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market, or on the Pink Sheets, as the case may be. Any such delisting of our securities could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.", "PERMNO": 14355, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "RIBT"}
