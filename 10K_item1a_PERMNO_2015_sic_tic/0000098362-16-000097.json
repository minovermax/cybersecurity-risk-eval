Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks that are described below are not the only ones that we face. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisk Relating to our Business\nThe bearing industry is highly competitive, and this competition results in significant pricing pressure for our products that could affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe global bearing industry is highly competitive. We compete with domestic manufacturers and many foreign manufacturers of anti-friction bearings, including SKF Group, the Schaeffler Group, NTN Corporation, JTEKT Corporation and NSK Ltd. Due to the competitiveness within the bearing industry, we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover increases in our costs. In many cases we face pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, our customers may choose to purchase products from one of our competitors rather than pay the prices we seek for our products, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur business is capital intensive, and if there are downturns in the industries that we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend operations with respect to those industries, which could result in our recording asset impairment charges or taking other measures that may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nOur business operations are capital intensive, and we devote a significant amount of capital to certain industries. Our profitability is dependent on factors such as labor compensation and productivity and inventory management, which are subject to risks that we may not be able to control. If there are downturns in the industries that we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend our operations with respect to those industries, including laying-off employees, reducing production, recording asset impairment charges and other measures, which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWeakness in global economic conditions or in any of the industries or geographic regions in which we or our customers operate, as well as the cyclical nature of our customers' businesses generally or sustained uncertainty in financial markets, could adversely impact our revenues and profitability by reducing demand and margins.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and in global capital markets. There has been significant volatility in the capital markets and in the end markets and geographic regions in which we and our customers operate, which has negatively affected our revenues. Our revenues may also be negatively affected by changes in customer demand, changes in the product mix and negative pricing pressure in the industries in which we operate. Margins in those industries are highly sensitive to demand cycles, and our customers in those industries historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. As a result, our revenues and earnings are impacted by overall levels of industrial production.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets or in any of the geographic regions in which we, our customers and our suppliers, operate. If an end user cannot obtain financing to purchase our products, either directly or indirectly contained in machinery or equipment, demand for our products will be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and earnings.\nGlobal financial markets have experienced volatility in recent years, including volatility in securities prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability. Our access to the financial markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and company performance. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenors than we prefer or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nIf a customer becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover accounts receivable from that customer would be adversely affected and any payment we received during the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy estate. Furthermore, if certain of our customers liquidate in bankruptcy, we may incur impairment charges relating to obsolete inventory and machinery and equipment. In addition, financial instability of certain companies in the supply chain could disrupt production in any particular industry. A disruption of production in any of the industries where we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and earnings.\nIf any of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs, our ability to offer and deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis could be impaired. We cannot assure you that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect. Furthermore, if any of our suppliers were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement relationships on favorable terms, which could harm our sales and operating results.\nAny change in raw material prices or the availability or cost of raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins.\nWe require substantial amounts of raw materials, including steel, to operate our business. Our supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and could do so in the future. We generally attempt to manage these fluctuations by passing along increased raw material prices to our customers in the form of price increases; however, we may be unable to increase the price of our products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors, which could adversely impact our revenue and profit margins.\nMoreover, future disruptions in the supply of our raw materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices in order to obtain these raw materials from other sources. Any significant increase in the prices for such raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins.\nWarranty, recall, quality or product liability claims could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nIn our business, we are exposed to warranty and product liability claims. In addition, we may be required to participate in the recall of a product. If we fail to meet customer specifications for their products, we may be subject to product quality costs and claims. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe may incur further impairment and restructuring charges that could materially affect our profitability.\nWe have taken $180.7 million in impairment and restructuring charges in the aggregate during the last five years. Changes in business or economic conditions, or our business strategy, may result in additional restructuring programs and may require us to take additional charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations and environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect.\nWe are subject to the risk of substantial environmental liability and limitations on our operations due to environmental laws and regulations. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination. The risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs.\nCompliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. To date, we have committed significant expenditures in our efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with these requirements at our facilities, and we expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures related to such compliance in the future. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental authorities with respect to environmental matters, including matters involving alleged noncompliance with or liability under environmental, health and safety laws, property damage or personal injury. New laws and regulations, including those that may relate to emissions of greenhouse gases, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems.\nThe Company relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and operate its business. A breach in security could expose the Company and its customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect the Company's reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our asset values, results of operations and competitiveness.\nWe are exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant portion of our net sales, costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These risks include a reduction in our asset values, net sales, operating income and competitiveness.\nFor those countries outside the United States where we have significant sales, devaluation in the local currency would reduce the value of our local inventory as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, a stronger U.S. dollar would result in reduced revenue, operating profit and shareholders' equity due to the impact of foreign exchange translation on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may make our products more expensive for others to purchase or increase our operating costs, affecting our competitiveness and our profitability.\nChanges in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies and volatile economic, political and market conditions in emerging market countries have in the past adversely affected our financial performance and may in the future adversely affect the value of our assets located outside the United States, our gross profit and our results of operations.\nGlobal political instability and other risks of international operations may adversely affect our operating costs, revenues and the price of our products.\nOur international operations expose us to risks not present in a purely domestic business, including primarily:\n\u2022\nchanges in tariff regulations, which may make our products more costly to export or import;\n\u2022\ndifficulties establishing and maintaining relationships with local original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and dealers;\n\u2022\nimport and export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and environmental or other regulatory requirements, which could increase our operating and other expenses and limit our operations;\n\u2022\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; and\n\u2022\ntax exposures related to cross-border intercompany transfer pricing and other tax risks unique to international operations.\nThese and other risks may also increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, reducing the demand for our products in the markets in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.\nThe funded status of our defined benefit and other postretirement plans has caused and may in the future cause a reduction in our shareholders' equity.\nWe may be required to record charges related to pension and other postretirement liabilities as a result of asset returns, discount rate changes or other actuarial adjustments. These charges may be significant and would cause a reduction in our shareholders' equity.\nExpenses and contributions related to our defined benefit plans are affected by factors outside our control, including the performance of plan assets, interest rates, actuarial data and experience, and changes in laws and regulations.\nOur future expense and funding obligations for the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors, including the level of benefits provided for by the plans, the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine the discount rate to calculate the amount of liabilities, actuarial data and experience and any changes in government laws and regulations. In addition, if the various investments held by our pension trusts do not perform as expected or the liabilities increase as a result of discount rates and other actuarial changes, our pension expense and required contributions would increase and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business. We may be legally required to make contributions to the pension plans in the future in excess of our current expectations, and those contributions could be material.\nFuture actions involving our defined benefit and other postretirement plans, such as annuity purchases, lump sum payouts, and/or plan terminations could cause us to incur significant pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment charges.\nWe have purchased annuities and offered lump sum payouts to defined benefit plan and other postretirement plan participants and retirees in the past. If we were to take similar actions in the future, we could incur significant pension settlement and curtailment charges related to the reduction in pension and postretirement obligations from annuity purchases, lump sum payouts of benefits to plan participants, and/or plan terminations.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially affect our earnings.\nA work stoppage at one or more of our facilities, or at facilities of one or more of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws, but we cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the improper acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, export control or sanction violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompliance with the laws and regulations described above or with other applicable foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, finance, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these types of employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the improved operating results that we anticipate from past and future acquisitions and we may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.\nWe seek to grow, in part, through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses, and expect to continue to do so in the future. These acquisitions involve challenges and risks. In the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment, our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services.\nThe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected, to varying degrees, by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. The end result could be a negative impact on our operating results.\nIf our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods, including processes related to newly acquired businesses; however, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized. In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nRisks Relating to the Spinoff of TimkenSteel\nPotential indemnification liabilities to TimkenSteel Corporation (TimkenSteel) pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with the tax-free spinoff of TimkenSteel into a separate independent publicly traded company on June 30, 2014 (the Spinoff), could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement, an employee matters agreement and a tax sharing agreement, all with TimkenSteel, which provide for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Spinoff, certain conditions to the Spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between the Company and TimkenSteel with respect to and resulting from the Spinoff. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our continuing business operations, whether incurred prior to or after the Spinoff, as well as those obligations of TimkenSteel assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. If we are required to indemnify TimkenSteel under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, we could be subject to substantial liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spinoff, TimkenSteel has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities related to its steel business operations, but if it is unable to fulfill such obligations, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, the employee matters agreement and the tax sharing agreement, TimkenSteel has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities related to its steel business operations. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that TimkenSteel has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from TimkenSteel will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that TimkenSteel will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In particular, if TimkenSteel is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, the Company could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. If TimkenSteel becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover amounts that TimkenSteel has agreed to indemnify us for would be adversely affected. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from TimkenSteel any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. If TimkenSteel is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Spinoff does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, the Company and its shareholders could be subject to substantial tax liabilities.\nThe Spinoff was conditioned on our receipt of an opinion from Covington & Burling LLP, special tax counsel to the Company, that the distribution of TimkenSteel common shares in the Spinoff qualified as tax-free (except for cash received by shareholders in lieu of fractional shares) to the Company, TimkenSteel and the Company\u2019s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code. The opinion relied on, among other things, various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the Company and TimkenSteel, which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the opinion of counsel to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. The opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the qualification of the Spinoff as a transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Code will not be challenged by the IRS or by others in court, or that any such challenge would not prevail. If the Spinoff is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, as each U.S. holder of the Company\u2019s common shares that received TimkenSteel common shares in the Spinoff would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the TimkenSteel common shares received.\nCertain members of our Board of Directors and management may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of shares of TimkenSteel or their relationships with TimkenSteel following the Spinoff.\nCertain members of our Board of Directors and management own shares of TimkenSteel and/or options to purchase shares of TimkenSteel, which could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and TimkenSteel. Two of our directors, Ward J. Timken, Jr. and John P. Reilly, are also directors of TimkenSteel and, in the case of Mr. Timken, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of TimkenSteel. This may create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for TimkenSteel then the decisions have for us.", "PERMNO": 14795, "SIC": 3562, "TIC": "TKR"}
