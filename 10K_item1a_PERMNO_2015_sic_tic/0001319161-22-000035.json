RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, certain risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely impact our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d following this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate, and we may suffer reduced profits as a result.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, have experienced ongoing consolidation among major music entertainment companies and are driven by consumer preferences that are rapidly changing. Additionally, they require substantial human and capital resources. We compete with other recorded music companies and music publishing companies to identify and sign new recording artists and songwriters with the potential to achieve long-term success and to enter into and renew agreements with established recording artists and songwriters. In addition, our competitors may from time to time increase the amounts they spend to discover, or to market and promote, recording artists and songwriters or reduce the prices of their music in an effort to expand market share. We may lose business if we are unable to sign successful recording artists or songwriters or to match the prices offered by our competitors. Our Recorded Music business competes not only with other recorded music companies, but also with recording artists who may choose to distribute their own works (which has become more practicable as music is distributed online rather than physically) and companies in other industries (such as Spotify) that may choose to sign direct deals with recording artists or recorded music companies. Our Music Publishing business competes not only with other music publishing companies, but also with songwriters who publish their own works and companies in other industries that may choose to sign direct deals with songwriters or music publishing companies. In addition to competition from traditional music industry players, we also face competition from new entrants, including investment funds that make acquisitions or investments in recorded music or music publishing catalogs and the income streams derived therefrom. The Recorded Music business also faces competition from other forms of entertainment and leisure activities, such as cable and satellite television, motion pictures and video games in physical and digital formats.\nOur prospects and financial results may be adversely affected if we fail to identify, sign and retain recording artists and songwriters and by the existence or absence of superstar releases.\nWe are dependent on identifying, signing and retaining recording artists with long-term potential, whose debut music is well received on release, whose subsequent music is anticipated by consumers and whose music will continue to generate sales as part of our catalog for years to come. The competition among record companies for such talent is intense. Competition among record companies to sell and otherwise market and promote music is also intense. We are also dependent on signing and retaining songwriters who will write the hit songs of today and the classics of tomorrow. Our competitive position is dependent on our continuing ability to attract and develop recording artists and songwriters whose work can achieve a high degree of public acceptance and who can timely deliver their music to us. Our financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to identify, sign and retain such recording artists and songwriters under terms that are economically attractive to us, including with respect to recording commitments, advance and royalty obligations and rights retention. Our financial results may also be affected by the existence or absence of superstar recording artist releases during a particular period. Some music entertainment industry observers believe that the number of superstar recording acts with long-term appeal, both in terms of catalog sales and future releases, has declined in recent years. Additionally, our financial results are generally affected by the appeal of our recorded music and music publishing catalogs to consumers.\nIf streaming adoption or revenue grows less rapidly or levels off, our prospects and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nStreaming revenue is important because it has offset declines in downloads and physical sales and represents a growing area of our business. According to IFPI, streaming revenue, which includes revenue from ad-supported and subscription services, accounted for approximately 94% of digital revenue in 2021, up approximately 2% year-over-year. There can be no assurance that this growth pattern will persist or that digital revenue will continue to grow at a rate sufficient to offset and exceed declines in downloads and physical sales. If growth in streaming revenue levels off or fails to grow as quickly as it has over the past several years, our business may experience reduced levels of revenue and operating income.\nWe are substantially dependent on a limited number of digital music services for the online distribution and marketing of our music, and they are able to significantly influence the pricing structure for online music stores and may not correctly calculate royalties under license agreements.\nWe derive an increasing portion of our revenue from the licensing of music through digital distribution channels. We are currently dependent on a small number of leading digital music services. In fiscal year 2022, revenue earned under our license agreements with our top three digital music accounts, Spotify, YouTube and Apple, accounted for approximately 40% of our total revenue. We have limited ability to increase our wholesale prices to digital music services as a small number of digital music services control much of the legitimate digital music business. If these services were to adopt a lower pricing model or if there were structural changes to other pricing models, we could receive substantially less for our music, which could cause a material reduction in our revenue, unless offset by a corresponding increase in the number of subscribers or transactions. We currently enter into short-term license agreements with many digital music services and provide our music on an at-will basis to others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or enter into new license agreements with any digital music service. The terms of these license agreements, including the royalties that we receive pursuant to them, may change as a result of changes in our bargaining power, changes in the industry, changes in the law or for other reasons. Decreases in royalty rates, rates of revenue sharing or changes to other terms of these license agreements may materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Digital music services generally accept and make available all of the music that we deliver to them. However, if digital music services in the future decide to limit the types or amount of music they will accept from music entertainment companies like us, our revenue could be significantly reduced. See \u201cBusiness-Recorded Music-Sales and Digital Distribution.\u201d\nWe are also substantially dependent on a limited number of digital music services for the marketing of our music. A significant proportion of the music streamed on digital music services is from playlists curated by those services or generated from those services\u2019 algorithms. If these services were to fail to include our music on playlists, change the position of our music on playlists or give us less marketing space, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnder our license agreements and relevant statutes, we receive royalties from digital music services in exchange for the rights to stream or otherwise offer our music. The determination of the amount and timing of such payments is complex and subject to a number of variables, including the revenue generated, the type of music offered and the country in which it is sold, identification of the appropriate licensor, and the service tier on which music is made available. As a result, we may not be paid appropriately for our music. Failure to be accurately paid our royalties may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations in some foreign countries subject us to trends, developments or other events which may affect us adversely.\nWe are a global company with strong local presences, which have become increasingly important as the popularity of music originating from a country\u2019s own language and culture has increased in recent years. Our mix of national and international recording artists and songwriters is designed to provide a significant degree of diversification. However, our music does not necessarily enjoy universal appeal and if it does not continue to appeal in various countries, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. As a result, our results can be affected not only by general industry trends, but also by trends, developments or other events in individual countries, including:\n\u2022limited legal protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022restrictions on the repatriation of capital;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022differences and unexpected changes in regulatory environment, including environmental, health and safety, local planning, zoning and labor laws, rules and regulations;\n\u2022varying tax regimes which could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, including regulations relating to transfer pricing and withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and joint ventures;\n\u2022exposure to different legal standards and enforcement mechanisms and the associated cost of compliance;\n\u2022difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees or rationalizing our workforce;\n\u2022tariffs, duties, export controls and other trade barriers;\n\u2022global economic and retail environment;\n\u2022longer accounts receivable settlement cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022recessionary trends, inflation and instability of the financial markets;\n\u2022higher interest rates; and\n\u2022political instability.\nWe may not be able to insure or hedge against these risks, and we may not be able to ensure compliance with all of the applicable regulations without incurring additional costs, or at all. For example, our results of operations could be impacted by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. See \u201c-Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\u201d Furthermore, financing may not be available in countries with less than investment-grade sovereign credit ratings. As a result, it may be difficult to create or maintain profitable operations in various countries.\nIn addition, our results can be affected by trends, developments and other events in individual countries. There can be no assurance that in the future country-specific trends, developments or other events will not have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Unfavorable conditions can depress revenues in any given market and prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins. On February 24, 2022, the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions and other measures imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. We own Recorded Music and Music Publishing businesses within Russia and, on March 10, 2022, the Company announced a suspension of these operations. While our operations in Russia do not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of the conflict's current scope, increased or sustained economic disruption, sanctions or countersanctions, further devaluation of the local currency or increased cyber-related disruptions could make it difficult to deliver our content, increase costs, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become increasingly exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We have substantial assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. Prior to intersegment eliminations, 54% of our revenues related to operations in foreign territories for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. During the current fiscal year, we have hedged a portion of our material foreign currency exposures related to royalty payments remitted between our foreign affiliates and our U.S. affiliates. However, these hedging strategies should not be expected to fully eliminate the foreign exchange rate risk to which we are exposed.\nOur business may be adversely affected by competitive market conditions, and we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nWe expect to increase revenues and cash flow through a business strategy which requires us, among other things, to continue to maximize the value of our music, to significantly reduce costs to maximize flexibility and adjust to new realities of the market, to continue to act to contain digital piracy and to diversify our revenue streams into growing segments of the music entertainment business by continuing to capitalize on digital distribution and emerging technologies, entering into expanded-rights deals with recording artists and by operating our artist services businesses.\nEach of these initiatives requires sustained management focus, organization and coordination over significant periods of time. Each of these initiatives also requires success in building relationships with third parties and in anticipating and keeping up with technological developments and consumer preferences and may involve the implementation of new business models or distribution platforms. The results of our strategy and the success of our implementation of this strategy will not be known for some time in the future. If we are unable to implement our strategy successfully or properly react to changes in market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur business is to a large extent dependent on technological developments, including access to and selection and viability of new technologies, and is subject to potential pressure from competitors as a result of their technological developments. For example, our business may be further adversely affected by technological developments that facilitate the piracy of music, such as Internet peer-to-peer file sharing, by an inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in digital environments and by a failure to further develop successful business models applicable to a digital environment.\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.\nOn March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak (also referred to as \u201cCOVID\u201d) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has had and will have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe virus outbreak resulted in disruptions in manufacturing and physical supply chains, and resulted in mandated closure of physical retailers, requirements that people stay in their homes and delays in the release of new recordings from artists with a more physical consumer base.\nIt temporarily ended and has continued to limit live concert tours, adversely impacting our concert promotion business and our sale of tour merchandise. It made it more difficult for artists to engage in marketing efforts around the release of their new recordings which, in some cases, led to our decision to delay the release of those recordings. It delayed the release of new recordings by impeding the types of collaboration among artists, songwriters, producers, musicians, engineers and studios which are necessary for the delivery of those recordings.\nWe also experienced a decline in licensing revenue and, to a lesser extent, ad-supported digital revenue in our Recorded Music business and synchronization, performance and ad-supported digital revenue in our Music Publishing business.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section.\nGiven the uncertainty around the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation of the virus and around the imposition or relaxation of protective measures, we cannot at this time reasonably estimate the impact to our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our executive officers.\nWe compete with other music entertainment companies and other companies for top talent, including executive officers. Our success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers, however, there is no guarantee that they will not leave. In fiscal year 2022, we did not have an employment agreement with our CEO. However, we have an employment agreement with our new CEO and other executive officers and they and other members of management are participants in our equity plans. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key members of management or the failure to attract and retain other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects.\nA significant portion of our revenue is subject to rate regulation either by government entities or by local third-party collecting societies throughout the world and rates on other income streams may be set by governmental proceedings, which may limit our profitability.\nMechanical royalties and performance royalties are two of the main sources of income to our Music Publishing business and mechanical royalties are a significant expense to our Recorded Music business. In the United States, mechanical royalty rates are set every five years pursuant to an administrative process under the U.S. Copyright Act, unless rates are determined through industry negotiations, and performance royalty rates are determined by negotiations with performing rights societies, the largest of which, ASCAP and BMI, are subject to a consent decree rate-setting process if negotiations are unsuccessful. Outside the United States, mechanical and performance royalty rates are typically negotiated on an industry-wide basis. In most territories outside the United States, mechanical royalties are based on a percentage of wholesale prices for physical product and based on a percentage of consumer prices for digital formats. The mechanical and performance royalty rates set pursuant to such processes may adversely affect us by limiting our ability to increase the profitability of our Music Publishing business. If the mechanical and performance royalty rates are set too high it may also adversely affect us by limiting our ability to increase the profitability of our Recorded Music business. In addition, rates our Recorded Music business receives in the United States for webcasting and satellite radio are set every five years by an administrative process under the U.S. Copyright Act unless rates are determined through industry negotiations. It is important as revenue continues to shift from physical to diversified distribution channels that we receive fair value for all of the uses of our intellectual property as our business model now depends upon multiple revenue streams from multiple sources. The rates set for recorded music and music publishing income sources through collecting societies or legally prescribed rate-setting processes could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible and long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results and equity.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $1.920 billion of goodwill and $145 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d) requires that we test these assets for impairment annually (or more frequently should indications of impairment arise) by first assessing qualitative factors and then by quantitatively estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units (calculated using a discounted cash flow method) and comparing that value to the reporting units\u2019 carrying value, if necessary. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, there is a potential impairment and additional testing must be performed. In performing our annual tests and determining whether indications of impairment exist, we consider numerous factors including actual and projected operating results of each reporting unit, external market factors such as market prices for similar assets and trends in the music entertainment industry. We performed an annual assessment, at July 1, 2022, of the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles as of September 30, 2022, noting no instances of impairment. However, future events may occur that could adversely affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions and the impact of the economic environment on our operating results. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at our reporting units could also result in impairment charges on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the value of the acquired goodwill or acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets is impaired, our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected.\nWe also had $2.239 billion of definite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2022. FASB ASC Topic 360-10-35 (\u201cASC 360-10-35\u201d) requires companies to review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. No such events or circumstances were identified during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. If similar events occur as enumerated above such that we believe indicators of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset, which could result in an impairment charge. Any impairment charge recorded could negatively affect our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nIf we acquire, combine with or invest in other businesses, we will face risks inherent in such transactions.\nWe have in the past considered and will continue, from time to time, to consider, opportunistic strategic or transformative transactions, which could involve acquisitions, combinations or dispositions of businesses or assets, or strategic alliances or joint ventures with companies engaged in music entertainment, entertainment or other businesses. Any such combination could be material, be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile, focus or strategy significantly.\nAny future transaction could involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022potential loss of recording artists or songwriters from our rosters;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the acquired businesses or segregating assets to be disposed of;\n\u2022exposure to unknown and/or contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition, disposition and/or against any businesses we may acquire;\n\u2022reputational or other damages to our business as a result of a failure to consummate such a transaction for, among other reasons, failure to gain antitrust approval; and\n\u2022changing our business profile in ways that could have unintended consequences.\nIf we enter into significant transactions in the future, related accounting charges may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly in the case of any acquisitions. In addition, the financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which may be substantial. Conversely, any material disposition could reduce our indebtedness or require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any strategic or transformative transactions. We cannot assure you that if we make any future acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or joint ventures or enter into any business combination that they will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, that they will be structured or financed in a way that will enhance our creditworthiness or that they will meet our strategic objectives or otherwise be successful. We also may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational, financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these transactions. Failure to effectively manage any of these transactions could result in material increases in costs or reductions in expected revenues, or both. In addition, if any new business in which we invest or which\nwe attempt to develop does not progress as planned, we may not recover the funds and resources we have expended and this could have a negative impact on our businesses or our company as a whole.\nWe have outsourced certain finance and accounting functions and may outsource other back-office functions, which will make us more dependent upon third parties.\nIn an effort to be more efficient and generate cost savings, we have outsourced certain finance and accounting functions. As a result, we rely on third parties to ensure that our needs are sufficiently met. This reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over processes, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results, and potentially, termination of these services by our suppliers. A failure of our service providers to perform services in a satisfactory manner may have a significant adverse effect on our business. We may outsource other back-office functions in the future, which would increase our reliance on third parties.\nWe have engaged in substantial restructuring activities in the past, and may need to implement further restructurings in the future and our restructuring efforts may not be successful or generate expected cost savings.\nOur business is significantly impacted by ongoing changes in the music entertainment industry. In response, we actively seek to adapt our cost structure to the changing economics of the industry. For example, we have shifted and continue to shift resources from our physical sales channels to efforts focused on digital channels, emerging technologies and other new revenue streams, and we continue our efforts to reduce overhead and manage our variable and fixed-cost structure. In fiscal year 2018, we completed the creation of our new center of excellence for U.S. financial shared services in Nashville, Tennessee, which combined our U.S. transactional financial functions in one location. To establish the new center, we moved some of our U.S. departments to Nashville. In August 2019, we announced that we were beginning a financial transformation initiative to upgrade our information technology and finance infrastructure, including related systems and processes. There has been a delay in the timing of the transformation initiative as a result of the disruption from COVID-19. In addition, the size and scale of this global system implementation requires us to invest more time performing the rigorous system testing and data validation to ensure go-live readiness. We expect to incur material costs in connection with this project, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in upgrading our systems and processes effectively or on the timetable and at the costs contemplated, or that we will achieve the expected long-term cost savings.\nWe cannot be certain that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities, make additions or other changes to our management or workforce based on other cost reduction measures or changes in the markets and industry in which we compete. Our inability to structure our operations based on evolving market conditions could impact our business. Restructuring activities can create unanticipated consequences and negative impacts on the business, and we cannot be sure that any ongoing or future restructuring efforts will be successful or generate expected cost savings.\nThe enactment of legislation limiting the terms by which an individual can be bound under a \u201cpersonal services\u201d contract could impair our ability to retain the services of key artists.\nCalifornia Labor Code Section 2855 (\u201cSection 2855\u201d) limits the duration of time any individual can be bound under a contract for \u201cpersonal services\u201d to a maximum of seven years. In 1987, Subsection (b) was added, which provides a limited exception to Section 2855 for recording contracts, creating a damages remedy for record companies. Such legislation could result in certain of our existing contracts with artists being declared unenforceable, or may restrict the terms under which we enter into contracts with artists in the future, either of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In March 2021, a California Assembly Member introduced a bill (AB 1385) that sought to repeal Subsection (b). The bill was withdrawn in April 2021, but a similar bill was reintroduced in February 2022 and was ultimately rejected by the California State Senate in June 2022. The repeal of Subsection (b) and/or the passage of legislation similar to Section 2855 by other states could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe face a potential loss of catalog to the extent that our recording artists or songwriters have a right to recapture rights in their recordings or musical compositions under the U.S. Copyright Act.\nThe U.S. Copyright Act provides authors (or their heirs) a right to terminate U.S. licenses or assignments of rights in their copyrighted works in certain circumstances. This right does not apply to works that are \u201cworks made for hire.\u201d Since the enactment of the Sound Recordings Act of 1971, which first accorded federal copyright protection for sound recordings in the U.S., virtually all of our agreements with recording artists provide that such recording artists render services under a work-made-for-hire relationship. A termination right exists under the U.S. Copyright Act for U.S. rights in musical compositions that are not \u201cworks made for hire.\u201d If any of our commercially available sound recordings were determined not to be \u201cworks made for hire,\u201d then the recording artists (or their heirs) could have the right to terminate the U.S. federal copyright rights they granted to us, generally during a five-year period starting at the end of 35 years from the date of release of a recording under a post-1977 license or assignment (or, in the case of a pre-1978 grant in a pre-1978 recording, generally during a five-year period starting at the end of 56 years from the date of copyright). A termination of U.S. federal copyright rights could have an adverse effect on our Recorded Music business. From time to time,\nauthors (or their heirs) have the opportunity to terminate our U.S. rights in musical compositions. We believe the effect of any potential terminations is already reflected in the financial results of our business.\nGovernments could enact new legislation or could make regulatory determinations that affect the terms of our contracts with recording artists and songwriters.\nSome recording artist and songwriter groups, particularly in Europe, are urging governments to intervene in the music streaming business in ways that could affect the terms agreed in our contracts with them. Government intervention in the music streaming business could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nWe are subject to the reporting, accounting and corporate governance requirements applicable to issuers of listed equity, including the listing standards of NASDAQ and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. Failure to comply with any of the public company requirements applicable to us could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Data Security\nFailure to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. The measures that we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including, if necessary, litigation or proceedings before governmental authorities and administrative bodies, may be ineffective, expensive and time-consuming and, despite such measures, third parties may be able to obtain and use our intellectual property rights without our permission. Additionally, changes in law may be implemented, or changes in interpretation of such laws may occur, that may affect our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Failure to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our brand or brand recognition and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also in-license certain major trademarks from third parties, including the WARNER, WARNER MUSIC and WARNER RECORDS trademarks and the \u201cW\u201d logo, pursuant to a perpetual, royalty-free license agreement that may be terminated by the licensor under certain circumstances, including our material breach of the license agreement and certain events of insolvency. Upon any such termination, we may be required to either negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms or otherwise lose our rights to use the licensed trademarks, which may require us to change our corporate name and undergo other significant rebranding efforts. Any such rebranding efforts may be disruptive to our business operations, require us to incur significant expenses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur involvement in intellectual property litigation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon intellectual property, an area that has encountered increased litigation in recent years. If we are alleged to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of a third party, any litigation to defend the claim could be costly and would divert the time and resources of management, regardless of the merits of the claim and whether the claim is settled out of court or determined in our favor. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such litigation. If we were to lose a litigation relating to intellectual property, we could be forced to pay monetary damages and to cease using certain intellectual property or technologies. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business.\nDigital piracy continues to adversely impact our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from the distribution of music which is potentially subject to unauthorized consumer copying and widespread digital dissemination without an economic return to us, including as a result of \u201cstream-ripping.\u201d In its Engaging with Music 2021 report, IFPI surveyed 43,000 people to examine the ways in which music consumers engaged with recorded music across 21 countries. Of those surveyed, 30% had used illegal or unlicensed methods to listen to or download music, and 14% had used unlicensed social media platforms for music purposes, the leading form of music piracy. Organized industrial piracy may also lead to decreased revenues. The impact of digital piracy on legitimate music revenues and subscriptions is hard to quantify, but we believe that illegal file sharing and other forms of unauthorized activity, including stream manipulation, have a\nsubstantial negative impact on music revenues. If we fail to obtain appropriate relief through the judicial process or the complete enforcement of judicial decisions issued in our favor (or if judicial decisions are not in our favor), if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to lobby governments to enact and enforce stronger legal penalties for copyright infringement or if we fail to develop effective means of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property (whether copyrights or other intellectual property rights such as patents, trademarks and trade secrets) or our music entertainment-related products or services, our results of operations, financial position and prospects may suffer.\nIf we or our service providers do not maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and vendors and our music, security information breaches through cyber security attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers, employees, vendors and artists, and we could incur substantial additional costs, become subject to litigation and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, even if we or our service providers maintain such security, such breaches remain a possibility due to the fact that no data security system is immune from attacks or other incidents.\nWe receive certain personal information about our customers and potential customers, and we also receive personal information concerning our employees, artists and vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We maintain security measures with respect to such information, but despite these measures, our service providers have experienced security breaches in the past and remain vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and others that attempt to penetrate the security measures that we have in place. A compromise of our security systems or our service providers\u2019 security systems (through cyber-attacks, which are rapidly evolving and sophisticated, or otherwise) that results in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or other bad acts could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, potential customers, employees, artists and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of governmental penalties. Unauthorized persons have also attempted to redirect payments to or from us. If any such attempt were successful, we could lose and fail to recover the redirected funds, which loss could be material. We may also be subject to cyber-attacks that target our music, including not-yet-released music. The theft and premature release of this music may adversely affect our reputation with current and potential artists and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations.\nWe increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data. Such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, which could adversely affect our business.\nEvolving laws and regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could result in monetary penalties, increase the costs of operations or limit our activities.\nWe engage in a wide array of online activities globally and are thus subject to a broad range of related laws and regulations including, for example, those relating to privacy, consumer protection, data retention and data protection, online behavioral advertising, geo-location tracking, text messaging, e-mail advertising, mobile advertising, content regulation, defamation, age verification, the protection of children online, social media and other Internet, mobile and online-related prohibitions and restrictions. The regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues worldwide has become increasingly burdensome and complex, and is likely to continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission, security and disclosure of personal information by companies operating over the Internet and mobile platforms are receiving ever-increasing public and governmental scrutiny.\nThe U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for even greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and mobile platforms, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices, the use of location data and disclosures of privacy practices in the online and mobile environments, including with respect to online and mobile applications. State governments are engaged in similar legislative and regulatory activities (including the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) effective on January 1, 2020, the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act, effective January 1, 2023 (\u201cCPRA\u201d) and other analogous statutes more recently in other states). The effects of CCPA and these other recently adopted laws includes an increased ability of individuals to control the use of their personal data; heightened transparency obligations, increased obligations of companies to maintain the security of data; and increased exposure to fines or damages for companies that do not accord individuals their specified privacy rights, that experience data breaches or that do not maintain cybersecurity at certain levels of quality.\nIn addition, privacy and data security laws and regulations around the world are being implemented rapidly and evolving. These new and evolving laws (including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation effective on May 25, 2018) have resulted in greater compliance burdens for companies with global operations. Globally, many government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices with respect to information collected from consumers, electronic marketing and the use of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising.\nOur business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if laws or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the collection, use or disclosure of customer data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such collection, use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our operations, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, mechanisms, platforms and features that make use of data regarding our customers and potential customers. Any actual or alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability, fines and may require us to expend significant resources in responding to and defending such allegations and claims, regardless of merit. Claims or allegations that we have violated laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security could also result in negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us.\nRisks Related to Our Leverage\nOur substantial leverage on a consolidated basis could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2022, our total consolidated indebtedness, net of premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs, was $3.732 billion. Further, we would have been able to borrow up to $296 million under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined later in this Annual Report) as of September 30, 2022 (after giving effect to approximately $4 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2022). On November 1, 2022, Acquisition Corp. borrowed $150 million under a new tranche of its term loan facility, the proceeds of which will be used to pay the deferred purchase price of certain music and music-related assets, to pay fees and expenses relating thereto and for general corporate purposes.\nOur high degree of leverage could have important consequences for our investors. For example, it may make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility; expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at variable rates; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses; limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all or borrow additional funds in the future for, among other things, working capital, acquisitions or debt service requirements; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes as well as under the Senior Credit Facilities. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nThe indentures that govern our outstanding notes and the credit agreements that govern the Senior Credit Facilities (as defined later in this Annual Report) contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Those covenants include restrictions on our ability to, among other things, create liens and merge or consolidate. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility includes additional covenants which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur more indebtedness, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions, make investments, transfer or sell assets and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. These additional covenants are currently suspended. These covenants will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.\u2019s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating. Should these covenants be reinstated, they would limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Any such event of default or acceleration could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAs a holding company, the Company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its obligations.\nThe Company is a holding company for all of our operations and is a legal entity separate from its subsidiaries. Dividends and other distributions from the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are the principal sources of funds available to the Company to pay corporate operating expenses, to pay stockholder dividends, to repurchase stock and to meet its other obligations. The inability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe subsidiaries of the Company have no obligation to pay amounts due on any liabilities of the Company or to make funds available to the Company for such payments. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions to the Company in the future will depend, among other things, on their earnings, tax considerations and covenants contained in any financing or other agreements. For instance, our Revolving Credit Facility includes covenants restricting the ability of Acquisition Corp. to pay dividends and make distributions. Although these covenants are currently suspended, they will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.\u2019s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating. In addition, such payments may be limited as a result of claims against our subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees.\nIf the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to the Company is materially restricted by cash needs, bankruptcy or insolvency, or is limited due to operating results or other factors, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of assets. However, there is no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient cash by these means. This could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay our obligations or pay dividends, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAcquisition Corp. may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAcquisition Corp.\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its debt obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Acquisition Corp. may not maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nAcquisition Corp. will rely on its subsidiaries to make payments on its borrowings. If these subsidiaries do not dividend funds to Acquisition Corp. in an amount sufficient to make such payments, if necessary in the future, Acquisition Corp. may default under the indentures or credit agreements governing its borrowings, which would result in all such borrowings becoming due and payable.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes and the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: create liens on certain debt and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility includes additional covenants that would limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022pay dividends on, and redeem and purchase, equity interests;\n\u2022make other restricted payments; make prepayments on, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022incur certain additional debt; enter into guarantees and hedging arrangements;\n\u2022enter into acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022pay dividends or make distributions;\n\u2022amend the terms of subordinated debt and unsecured bonds; and\n\u2022make certain capital expenditures.\nThese additional covenants are currently suspended. These covenants will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.\u2019s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.\nOur ability to borrow additional amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. In addition, under the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, a financial maintenance covenant is applicable if at the end of a fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and letters of credit is in excess of $105 million.\nOur failure to comply with obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have\nsufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nAll of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business or may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise, and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. We may, from time to time, refinance our existing indebtedness, which could result in the agreements governing any new indebtedness having fewer or less restrictive covenants.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in recording artists and songwriters, capital expenditures or dividends, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. In addition, funds used to pay dividends to our shareholders will not be available to service our indebtedness.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The indentures governing our outstanding notes and the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities will not prohibit us, Holdings or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. We, Holdings or our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to incur secured indebtedness is subject to compliance with certain secured leverage ratios that are calculated as of the date of incurrence. The amount of secured indebtedness that we are able to incur and the timing of any such incurrence under these ratios vary from time to time and are a function of several variables, including our outstanding indebtedness and our results of operations calculated as of specified dates or for certain periods.\nTo the extent that the terms of our current debt agreements would prevent us from incurring additional indebtedness, we may be able to obtain amendments to those agreements that would allow us to incur such additional indebtedness, and such additional indebtedness could be material.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. The ability to generate cash or refinance indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other corporate expenses will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative and other factors and any legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions and dividends to which they may be subject. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our other needs. To satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, we must continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may need to reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Significant delays in our planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While limited by the terms of our debt agreements, if we were to pay dividends to our shareholders, the funds used to make such dividend payments would not be available to service our indebtedness.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us could cause the liquidity or market value of our indebtedness to decline and our cost of capital to increase.\nAny future downgrade of our ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Therefore, although reductions in our debt ratings may not have an immediate impact on the cost of debt or our liquidity, they may impact the cost of debt and liquidity over the medium term and future access at a reasonable rate to the debt markets may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Controlling Stockholder\nAccess continues to control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders. Conflicts of interest may arise because affiliates of our controlling stockholder have continuing agreements and business relationships with us.\nAccess holds approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and approximately 73% of the economic interest of our outstanding common stock. As a result, and in addition to certain other rights granted to Access, Access will continue to be able to control the election of our directors, affect our legal and capital structure, change our management, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Access also has sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents. In addition, under the provisions of a stockholder agreement entered into with Access (the \u201cStockholder Agreement\u201d), the relevant terms of which govern the powers afforded the Company under our organizational documents, Access has consent rights with respect to certain corporate and business activities that we may undertake, including during periods where Access holds less than a majority of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Specifically, the Stockholder Agreement provides that, until the date on which Access ceases to hold at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, Access\u2019s prior written consent will be required before we may take certain corporate and business actions, whether directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022any merger, consolidation or similar transaction (or any amendment to or termination of an agreement to enter into such a transaction) with or into any other person whether in a single transaction or a series of transactions, subject to certain specified exceptions;\n\u2022any acquisition or disposition of securities, assets or liabilities, subject to certain specified exceptions;\n\u2022any change in our authorized capital stock or the creation of any new class or series of our capital stock;\n\u2022any issuance or acquisition of capital stock (including stock buy-backs, redemptions or other reductions of capital), or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or equity-linked securities, subject to certain specified exceptions;\n\u2022any issuance or acquisition of debt securities to or from a third party, subject to certain specified exceptions; and\n\u2022any amendment (or approval or recommendation of any amendment) to our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\nAs a result of these consent rights, Access will maintain significant control over our corporate and business activities until such rights cease.\nAdditionally, until Access ceases to hold more than 50% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, pursuant to Section 141(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d), our Executive Committee, as the Company\u2019s governing body, has all of the power and authority (including voting power) of our board of directors. The Executive Committee has the authority to approve any actions of the Company, except for matters that must be approved by the Audit Committee of our board of directors (or both the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee), or by a committee or sub-committee qualified to grant equity to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act for purposes of exempting transactions pursuant to Section 16b-3 thereunder, or as required under Delaware law, SEC rules and NASDAQ rules.\nAccess also has the power to direct us to engage in strategic transactions, with or involving other companies in our industry, including acquisitions, combinations or dispositions, and the acquisition of certain assets that may become available for purchase, and any such transaction could be material.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws also include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control for so long as Access owns specified percentages of our common stock. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Common Stock-Anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\u201d These provisions not only could have a negative impact on the trading price of our Class A Common Stock, but could also allow Access to delay or prevent a corporate transaction of which the public stockholders approve.\nAdditionally, Access is in the business of making investments in companies and is actively seeking to acquire interests in businesses that operate in our industry and other industries and may compete, directly or indirectly, with us. Access may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, which could have the effect of making such acquisition opportunities unavailable to us. Access could elect to cause us to enter into business combinations or other transactions with any business or businesses in our industry that Access may acquire or control, or we could become part of a group of companies organized\nunder the ultimate common control of Access that may be operated in a manner different from the manner in which we have historically operated. Any such business combination transaction could require that we or such group of companies incur additional indebtedness, and could also require us or any acquired business to make divestitures of assets necessary or desirable to obtain regulatory approval for such transaction. The amounts of such additional indebtedness, and the size of any such divestitures, could be material. Access may also from time to time purchase outstanding debt securities that we issued, and could also subsequently sell any such debt securities. Any such purchase or sale may affect the value of, trading price or liquidity of our debt securities. See \u201c-Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Access and its affiliates, and in some circumstances, any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer, employee, stockholder, member or partner of Access and its affiliates, have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\u201d\nConflicts of interest may arise between our controlling stockholder and us. Affiliates of our controlling stockholder engage in transactions with us. Further, Access may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, and they may either directly, or through affiliates, also maintain business relationships with companies that may directly compete with us. In general, Access or its affiliates could pursue business interests or exercise their voting power as stockholders in ways that are detrimental to us but beneficial to themselves or to other companies in which they invest or with whom they have a material relationship. In addition, a number of persons who currently are our directors and officers have been and remain otherwise affiliated with Access and, in some cases, such affiliations also involve financial interests. These relationships may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Access and us.\nAs a result of these relationships, the interests of Access may not coincide with our interests or the interests of the holders of our Class A Common Stock. So long as Access continues to control a significant amount of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, Access will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions.\nUnder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Access and its affiliates, and in some circumstances, any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer, employee, stockholder, member or partner of Access and its affiliates, have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nThe policies relating to corporate opportunities and transactions with Access and its affiliates set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, address potential conflicts of interest between the Company, on the one hand, and Access, its affiliates and its directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members or partners who are directors or officers of the Company, on the other hand. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we, on our behalf and on behalf of our subsidiaries, renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, corporate opportunities, that are from time to time presented to Access or any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members or partners, even if the opportunity is one that we or our subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. None of Access, its affiliates or any of its directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members or partners will generally be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues, acquires or participates in such corporate opportunity, directs such corporate opportunity to another person or fails to present such corporate opportunity, or information regarding such corporate opportunity, to us or our subsidiaries unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or officer, such corporate opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer. To the fullest extent permitted by law, by becoming a stockholder in our company, stockholders will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Although these provisions are designed to resolve conflicts between us and Access and its affiliates fairly, conflicts may not be resolved in our favor or be resolved at all.\nIf Access sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction, our stockholders may not realize any change of control premium on shares of our Class A Common Stock and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party.\nAccess has the ability, should it choose to do so, to sell some or all of its shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction. If such a transaction were to be sufficient in size, it could result in a change of control of the Company. The ability of Access to privately sell such shares of our common stock, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the shares of our Class A Common Stock, could prevent our stockholders from realizing any change of control premium on their shares of our Class A Common Stock that may otherwise accrue to Access upon its private sale of our common stock. Additionally, if Access privately sells a significant equity interest in us, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with the interests of other stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and the existing ownership of Class B Common Stock by Access have the effect of concentrating voting control with Access for the foreseeable future, which will limit or preclude the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class A Common Stock has one vote per share and our Class B Common Stock has 20 votes per share. Given the greater number of votes per share attributed to our Class B Common Stock, Access, who is our only Class B Common Stock stockholder, holds approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result of our dual class ownership structure, Access is able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Further, Access owns shares representing approximately 73% of the economic interest of our outstanding common stock. Because of the 20-to-1 voting ratio between the Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class B Common Stock collectively continue to control a majority of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, so long as the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock represent at least approximately 10% of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. For example, Access will be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws, increases to the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans or adoption of new equity incentive plans and approval of any merger or sale of assets for the foreseeable future. This control may materially adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nAdditionally, the holders of our Class B Common Stock may cause us to make strategic decisions or pursue acquisitions that could involve risks to our other stockholders or may not be aligned with their interests. The holders of our Class B Common Stock will also be entitled to a separate vote in the event we seek to amend our certificate of incorporation.\nThe difference in the voting rights of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may harm the value and liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe difference in the voting rights of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock could harm the value of our Class A Common Stock to the extent that any investor or potential future purchaser of our Class A Common Stock ascribes value to the right of holders of our Class B Common Stock to 20 votes per share of Class B Common Stock. The existence of two classes of common stock could also result in less liquidity for our Class A Common Stock than if there were only one class of our common stock.\nOur dual class structure may depress the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur dual class structure may result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A Common Stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with dual or multiple class share structures in certain of their indexes. S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500. These changes exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to these indices. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of dual or multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A Common Stock in these indices and may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had 137,199,200 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 377,650,449 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. All of the shares of Class A Common Stock sold in the IPO were immediately tradable without restriction under the Securities Act except for any shares held by \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or \u201cRule 144.\u201d\nThe remaining shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding subsequent to the consummation of the IPO are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144, but will be eligible for resale subject, in certain cases, to applicable volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144 or pursuant to an exception from registration under Rule 701 under the Securities Act, or \u201cRule 701.\u201d Access has the right to require us to register shares of common stock for resale in some circumstances pursuant to a registration rights agreement we entered into with Access. Access has in the past sold shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 144 and in registered offerings to the public, and depending upon market prices for the Company\u2019s common stock may again do so from time to time.\nAdditionally, shares of Class A Common Stock are registered under our registration statements on Form S-8 to be issued under our equity compensation plans, including the Plan, and, as a result, all shares of Class A Common Stock acquired upon settlement of deferred equity units granted under the Plan will also be freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased by our affiliates. In addition, 31,169,099 shares of our Class A Common Stock were reserved for future issuances under the Omnibus Incentive Plan adopted in connection with the IPO over the 10-year period from the date of adoption. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has granted members of its Board of Directors a total of 248,040 shares of restricted and unrestricted common stock pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan. These grants represent compensation for board service for the period from the grant date until the Company\u2019s regularly scheduled annual shareholder meeting, at which time the restricted stock will be vested. Directors are entitled to dividends on this restricted stock during the vesting period.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our Class A Common Stock in connection with a financing, strategic investment, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022industry or general market conditions;\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022changes in our customers\u2019 preferences;\n\u2022changes in law or regulation;\n\u2022lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u2022adverse publicity related to us or another industry participant;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders (including Access), including future sales of our Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022failure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022investor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022war, terrorist acts, epidemic disease and pandemics, including COVID-19;\n\u2022any future sales of our Class A Common Stock or other securities;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022misconduct or other improper actions of our employees.\nStock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In the\npast, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the nature of our business, our results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur results of operations are affected by the amount and quality of music that we release, the number of releases that include musical compositions published by us, timing of release schedules and, more importantly, the consumer demand for these releases. We also make advance payments to recording artists and songwriters, which impact our results of operations and operating cash flows. The timing of releases and advance payments is largely based on business and other considerations and is made without regard to the impact of the timing of the release on our financial results. In addition, certain of our license agreements with digital music services contain minimum guarantees and/or require that we are paid minimum guarantee payments. Our results of operations and cash flows in any reporting period may be materially affected by the timing of releases and advance payments and minimum guarantees, which may result in significant fluctuations from period to period, which may have an adverse impact on the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts ceases coverage of our Class A Common Stock or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A Common Stock could decrease, which could cause our Class A Common Stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur existing debt securities do, and future offerings of debt or equity securities may, rank senior to our common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our total consolidated indebtedness, net of premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs, was $3.732 billion, all of which ranks senior to our Class A Common Stock. On November 1, 2022, Acquisition Corp. borrowed $150 million under a new tranche of its term loan facility, the proceeds of which will be used to pay the deferred purchase price of certain music and music-related assets, to pay fees and expenses relating thereto and for general corporate purposes. If, in the future, we decide to issue additional debt or equity securities that rank senior to our Class A Common Stock, it is likely that such securities will also be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility consistent with our existing debt agreements. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A Common Stock and may result in dilution to owners of our Class A Common Stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our Class A Common Stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Class A Common Stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws collectively:\n\u2022authorize two classes of common stock with disparate voting power;\n\u2022permit different treatment of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in a change of control transaction if approved by a majority of the voting power of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and a majority of the voting power of our outstanding Class B Common Stock, voting separately;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office once Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders if Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, if Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022require the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend our amended and restated by-laws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation if Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022subject us to Section 203 of the DGCL, which limits the ability of stockholders holding shares representing more than 15% of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us, once Access no longer owns at least 5% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A Common Stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A Common Stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant amount of common stock that Access owns and voting power that Access holds, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A Common Stock. These provisions may facilitate management and board entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAccess holds approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance standards, including:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of the members of our board of directors be independent directors;\n\u2022the requirement that our nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe intend to rely on these exemptions. As a result, we are not required to have a majority of independent directors, our compensation and our nominating and corporate governance committees will not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees may not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Consequently, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of NASDAQ corporate governance rules and requirements. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes provisions limiting the personal liability of our directors for breaches of fiduciary duty under the DGCL.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions permitted under the action asserting a claim arising under the DGCL relating to the liability of directors. These provisions will eliminate a director\u2019s personal liability to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty, except in circumstances involving:\n\u2022any breach of the director\u2019s duty of loyalty;\n\u2022acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;\n\u2022Section 174 of the DGCL (unlawful dividends); or\n\u2022any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.\nThe principal effect of the limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder will be unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a director unless the stockholder can demonstrate a basis for liability for which indemnification is not available under the DGCL. These provisions, however, should not limit or eliminate our rights or any stockholder\u2019s rights to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty. These provisions will not alter a director\u2019s liability under federal securities laws. The inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising out of or under the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (including, without limitation, any action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws) or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to such Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. However, claims subject to exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts, such as suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder, need not be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Stockholders in our company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Additionally, a court could determine that the exclusive forum provision is unenforceable, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90699, "SIC": 3652, "TIC": "WMG"}
