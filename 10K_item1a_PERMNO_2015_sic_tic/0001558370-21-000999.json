{"cik": "839470", "company": "WESTWATER RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. Every investor or potential investor in our securities should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such\nrisks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face a variety of risks related to our proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business.\nWe plan to develop a battery-graphite manufacturing business that produces low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products for battery manufacturers. The proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business is significantly different from our historic mining operations and carries a number of risks, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf our partnership with Dorfner Anzaplan and utilization of other engineering consultants for the associated pilot scale program may fail to meet current expectations, and, as a result, we may never realize commercial scale production of graphite products;\n\u25cf the definitive Feasibility Study, once completed, may conclude that our battery-graphite business plan is not economically feasible;\n\u25cf unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, including those related to intellectual property;\n\u25cf the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into the battery-graphite manufacturing business;\n\u25cf competition from better-funded public and private companies, including from producers of synthetic graphite, and competition from foreign companies that are not subject to the same environmental and other regulations as the Company;\n\u25cf difficulty in hiring personnel or acquiring the intellectual property rights and know-how needed for the proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business; and\n\u25cf the potential for interruptions in our sources of graphite prior to operation of the Coosa graphite mine due to environmental and transportation risks.\nEntry into a new line of business may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Further, our battery-graphite manufacturing business model and strategy are still evolving and are continually being reviewed and revised, and we may not be able to successfully implement our business model and strategy. We may not be able to produce graphite with the characteristics needed for battery production, and we may not be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers. Neither the Company nor any member of its management team has directly engaged in producing graphite or similar materials before, and our lack of experience may result in delays or further complications to the new business. If we are unable to successfully implement our new battery-graphite manufacturing business, our revenue and profitability may not grow as we expect, our competitiveness may be materially and adversely affected, and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nIn developing our proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business, we have and will continue to invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development of our battery-graphite manufacturing business may not be achieved. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation\nof our new battery-graphite manufacturing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe construction and operation of pilot program facilities and commercial production facilities in Alabama or other manufacturing facilities are subject to regulatory approvals and may be subject to delays, cost overruns or may not produce expected benefits.\nWe began operation of a pilot-scale processing plant in 2020, designed to both manufacture battery graphite materials in quantities suitable for potential customer testing and to inform a definitive Feasibility Study scheduled for mid-2021, which is expected to be followed by construction of a commercial scale processing facility in 2022 that purifies readily available graphite flake concentrates from various sources to 99.95% pure carbon. Construction projects of this scale are subject to risks and will require significant capital. Any failure to complete these plants on schedule and within budget could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nConstruction projects are also subject to broad and strict government supervision and approval procedures, including but not limited to project approvals and filings, construction land and project planning approvals, environment protection approvals, pollution discharge permits, work safety approvals and the completion of inspection and acceptance by relevant authorities. As a result, we may be subject to administrative uncertainty, fines or the suspension of work on such projects. To the extent we are unable to successfully complete construction on time or at all, our ability to develop our proposed battery-graphite manufacturing business could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWWR is not producing any products at a commercial scale at this time. As a result, we do not currently have a reliable source of operating cash. If we cannot successfully transition to commercial scale production of graphite and vanadium, partner with another company that has cash resources, find other means of generating and/or access additional sources of private or public capital, we may not be able to remain in business.\nWe do not have a committed source of financing for the development of our graphite or vanadium projects. Pursuant to our modified preliminary economic assessment of the Coosa Graphite Project, the capital expenditures to construct the commercial scale processing facility are estimated at approximately $120 million, and delays in constructing the commercial scale processing facility and other cost overruns may increase that estimate significantly. As of February 11, 2021, we have $101 million in cash, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, for the remainder of the amount needed to construct the commercial scale processing facility or develop our properties. Our inability to construct the commercial scale processing facility or develop our properties would have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nWe have incurred losses and have had no revenue from operations since 2009, and we expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future. We have no way to generate cash inflows outside of financing activities and we will continue to incur operating losses until we begin graphite and/or vanadium production on a scale sufficient to generate revenues to fund continuing operations, which cannot be assured. Our future graphite production is dependent on completion of the commercial scale processing facility and successful implementation of graphite purification technology. Our future vanadium production is dependent upon the completion of an evaluation plan that will assess the amount, location and size of vanadium concentrations at our Coosa Project mine in Alabama. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully produce graphite on a commercial scale, that our properties will be placed into production or that we will be able to continue to find, develop, acquire and\nfinance additional reserves. If we fail to reach commercial scale production and cannot find other means of generating revenue other than producing graphite and vanadium and/or access additional sources of private or public capital, we may not be able to remain in business and holders of our securities may lose their entire investment.\nVolatility in graphite and vanadium prices may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nUnless and until the Company produces natural graphite from the Coosa graphite deposit in Alabama, which is not projected to occur until the next eight to ten years at the earliest, the Company will be exposed to fluctuations in the price of natural flake graphite, which may increase substantially as the demand for graphite increases. In addition, the Company\u2019s graphite and vanadium exploration and development activities may be significantly adversely affected by volatility in the price of graphite or vanadium. The success of our mining operations and ability to achieve positive cash flow is dependent on our ability to develop our properties and then operate them at a profit sufficient to finance further mining activities and for the acquisition and development of additional properties. Any profit will necessarily be dependent upon, and affected by, the long and short-term market prices of graphite and vanadium. Mineral prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company\u2019s control such as global and regional supply and demand, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and foreign currencies, and the political and economic conditions of mineral-producing countries throughout the world. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in the Company\u2019s graphite and vanadium activities not producing an adequate return on invested capital to be profitable or viable. In addition, a significant, sustained drop in graphite and vanadium prices would cause us to recognize impairment of the carrying value of our graphite and vanadium or other assets, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial conditions and results of operations\nOur operations are each subject to environmental risks.\nWe are required to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations and permitting requirements in the United States, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future in connection with both our proposed graphite manufacturing business and our proposed graphite and vanadium mining operations. We have expended significant resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations and permitting requirements, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future. The material laws and regulations within the U.S. include the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Federal Land Policy Management Act, National Park System Mining Regulations Act, the State Mined Land Reclamation Acts or State Department of Environmental Quality regulations and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of the NEPA, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) as applicable.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation, regulation or policy will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation, generally, is toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue in the future. This recent trend includes, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to air and water quality, reclamation, waste handling and disposal, the protection of certain species, the preservation of certain lands, and epidemics and pandemics to the degree they impact us or our activities. These regulations may require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for certain activities. These laws and regulations may also limit or prohibit activities on certain lands. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may necessitate significant capital\noutlays, may materially affect our results of operations and business or may cause material changes or delay to our intended activities.\nOur operations may require additional analysis in the future including environmental, cultural and social impact and other related studies. Certain activities require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and directors, officers and employees. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary permits that may be required to continue our operation or exploration of our properties or, if feasible, to commence development, construction or operation of mining facilities at such properties on terms which enable operations to be conducted at economically justifiable costs. If we are unable to obtain or maintain permits or water rights for development of our properties or otherwise fail to manage adequately future environmental issues, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition from better-capitalized companies affects prices and our ability to acquire both properties and personnel.\nThere is global competition for capital, graphite and vanadium customers and the employment and retention of qualified personnel. In the production and marketing of graphite and vanadium, there are a number of producing entities, some of which are government controlled and most of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. Many of these organizations also have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and distribution resources than we have.\nBecause we have limited capital, inherent manufacturing and mining risks pose a significant threat to us compared with our larger competitors.\nBecause we have limited capital, we may be unable to withstand significant losses that can result from inherent risks associated with manufacturing and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, flooding, earthquake, interruptions due to weather conditions and other acts of nature which larger competitors could withstand. Such risks could result in damage to or destruction of our infrastructure and production facilities, as well as to adjacent properties, personal injury, environmental damage and processing and production delays, causing monetary losses and possible legal liability. Our business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur business and mineral exploration and processing programs depend upon our ability to employ the services of geologists, engineers and other experts. In operating our business and in order to continue our programs, we compete for the services of professionals with other mineral exploration and processing companies and businesses. In addition, several entities have expressed an interest in hiring certain of our employees. Our ability to maintain and expand our business and continue our exploration programs may be impaired if we are unable to continue to employ or engage those parties currently providing services and expertise to us or identify and engage other qualified personnel to do so in their place. To retain key employees, we may face increased compensation costs, including potential new stock incentive grants and there can be no assurance that the incentive measures we implement will be successful in helping us retain our key personnel.\nOur patents and other protective measures may not adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we may be infringing on the rights of others.\nOur intellectual property, particularly our proprietary rights to an improved method for the purification of graphite concentrate, is critical to our success. We have filed a provisional patent application in the United States, and we generally enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees and consultants.\nWe cannot assure that a patent application will result in an issued patent and our failure to secure rights under the patent application may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights at the core of our proposed graphite production business. In addition, such patent protection and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons generally applicable to patents and their granting and enforcement. In addition, the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may be expensive. Our inability to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights or gain a competitive advantage from such rights could harm our ability to generate revenues and, as a result, our business and operations.\nWe could also become subject to litigation claiming that our intellectual property or proprietary information infringes the rights of a third party. In that event, we could incur substantial defense costs and, if such litigation is successful, we could be required to pay the claimant damages and royalties for our past and future use of such intellectual property or proprietary information, or we could be prohibited from using it in the future, which could prevent us from pursuing our graphite production business, or we could be required to modify our process and facilities. Our inability to use our intellectual property and proprietary information on a cost-effective basis in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, cash flow and profitability.\nPandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus), may disrupt our business, supply chains and the business of our business partners, which could materially affect our operations, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. In addition, our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.\nIt is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could also further cause disruption in our supply chains, adversely affect our business partners, delay our plans to advance our pilot or commercial facilities or cause other unpredictable events. We continue to work with our stakeholders to address this global pandemic responsibly. In addition, we continue to monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications to our business, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe timing and amount of compensation relating to the revocation of the mining and exploration licenses for our Temrezli and Sefaatli projects is yet to be determined.\nOn June 20, 2018, the General Directorate of Mining Affairs, a department of the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, notified the Company that the mining and exploration licenses for its Temrezli and Sefaatli projects located in Turkey had been revoked and potential compensation would be proffered. Westwater has reached out on numerous occasions to the Turkish government to resolve this dispute amicably, to reinstate the licenses and to remedy its unlawful actions, but to no avail. As a result, on December 13, 2018 Westwater filed a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Turkey before ICSID, pursuant to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Turkey concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments. On December 21, 2018, ICSID advised that it had formally \u201cregistered\u201d the Request for Arbitration. On March 11, 2020, Turkey filed a request to bifurcate the arbitration proceeding, and on March\n30, 2020, Westwater filed a response in opposition to Turkey\u2019s request for bifurcation. On April 28, 2020, the arbitral tribunal denied Turkey\u2019s bifurcation request. On May 13, 2020, Turkey filed with the arbitral tribunal a request, which Westwater elected not to oppose, to extend the date on which their Counter-Memorial must be filed (and to change dates for subsequent pleadings as well as document production and witness identification deadlines), which the tribunal approved on June 3, 2020. As a result of these decisions by the tribunal, Turkey filed its Counter-Memorial on September 14, 2020. The hearing on the substantive issues and damages is scheduled for September 13-17, 2021.\nWhile the Company intends to continue to seek full and fair compensation for the licenses through arbitration with ICSID, the timing of such compensation is yet to be determined. In addition, the Company can provide no assurance about the amount of compensation, if any and an adverse result could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the sale of our uranium assets to enCore Energy Corp.\nWe may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the sale of our uranium assets to enCore, in which case our business, financial results or operations could be adversely affected. Under the terms of the enCore Purchase Agreement, enCore granted to Westwater a 2% net smelter return royalty on production from the uranium properties held by Uranco, Inc. in New Mexico at the time of the closing, and a 2.5% net profits interest on the profits from operations of Neutron Energy, Inc.\u2019s Juan Tafoya and Cebolleta Projects. If either the royalty or net profits interest is terminated, or if the terms of each are otherwise modified, we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the sale of our uranium assets, and our business may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the Company anticipates cost-savings of approximately $4 million annually, which were previously tied to land payments, reclamation expenses and operating costs associated with the uranium properties. There can be no assurance that we will realize any anticipated benefits of these cost-savings, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Exploration and Mining Activities\nExploration and development of graphite and vanadium properties are risky and subject to great uncertainties.\nThe exploration for and development of graphite and vanadium deposits involves significant risks. It is impossible to ensure that the current and future exploration programs on our existing properties will establish reserves. Whether an ore body will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; graphite and vanadium prices, which cannot be predicted and which have been highly volatile in the past; mining, processing and transportation costs; perceived levels of political risk and the willingness of lenders and investors to provide project financing; availability of labor, labor costs and possible labor strikes; availability of drilling rigs; and governmental regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting materials, foreign exchange, environmental protection, employment, worker safety, transportation, and reclamation and closure obligations. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of minerals and there can be no assurance that any of our exploration stage properties will be commercially mineable or can be brought into production.\nThe size and extent of the Company\u2019s vanadium mineral reserves at the Coosa Project is unknown and may not be in sufficient quantities to make its extraction and processing economically feasible.\nThe Company recently discovered significant vanadium concentrations at the Coosa Project and has developed an exploration plan to further investigate the size and extent of those concentrations. While there can be no assurance that the size and extent of those concentrations will end up being economically feasible, even if the Company finds vanadium in sufficient quantities to warrant recovery, it ultimately may not be recoverable. Finally, even if any vanadium is recoverable, the Company does not know whether recovery can be done at a profit. Our vanadium activities are highly prospective, face a high risk of failure and may not result in any benefit to the Company.\nPotential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration ventures and the high rate of failure of such ventures. The likelihood of success of the Company\u2019s vanadium exploration activities must be considered in light of the potential problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of new mineral properties. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. The expenditures to be made by the Company in the exploration of its new vanadium claims may not result in the discovery of new vanadium deposits. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in new mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. If the results of the Company\u2019s new exploration ventures do not reveal viable commercial mineralization, it may decide to abandon its claims. If this happens, the Company will not benefit from any of the expenditures it will incur in pursuing the claims.\nThe Company does not have and may not be able to obtain surface or access rights to all or a portion of the Coosa Project.\nAlthough the Company has rights to the minerals in the ground at the Coosa Project, the Company does not have rights to, or ownership of, the surface to the areas covered by its mineral rights. While applicable mining laws usually provide for rights of access to the surface for the purpose of carrying on mining activities, the enforcement of such rights through the courts can be costly and time consuming. It may be necessary for the Company to negotiate surface access or to purchase the surface rights if long-term access is required. There can be no guarantee that, despite having the right at law to access the surface and carry on mining activities, the Company will be able to negotiate satisfactory agreements with any such existing landowners/occupiers for such access or purchase such surface rights, and therefore it may be unable to carry out planned exploration or mining activities at the Coosa Project. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can be reached, the Company may need to rely on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such jurisdiction the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. The inability of the Company to secure surface access or purchase required surface rights could materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or overall ability of the Company to develop any mineral deposits it may locate at the Coosa Project.\nBecause mineral exploration and development activities are inherently risky, we may be exposed to environmental liabilities and other dangers. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance, or liabilities exceed the limits of our insurance policies, we may be unable to continue operations.\nThe business of mineral exploration and extraction involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into production. Unusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are other risks involved in extraction operations and the conduct of exploration programs. Previous mining operations may have caused environmental damage at certain\nof our properties. It may be difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by us or by the activities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and exemptions from liability may be ineffective. If any of our properties are found to have commercial quantities of minerals, we would be subject to additional risks respecting any development and production activities.\nAlthough we carry property and liability insurance with respect to our mineral development and exploration operations, we may become subject to liability for damage to life and property, environmental damage, cave-ins or hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of cost or other business reasons. In addition, the insurance industry is undergoing change and premiums are being increased. If we are unable to procure adequate insurance because of cost, unavailability or otherwise, we might be forced to cease operations.\nClosure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\nNatural resource companies are required to close their operations and remediate the lands in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and remediation costs for extractive operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and closure plans that may change materially. Any underestimated or unanticipated remediation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income in the related period.\nThe laws and regulations governing closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations.\nReserve and other mineralized material calculations are estimates only, and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including the prices of graphite and vanadium inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of graphite and vanadium in the recovery process.\nThe calculation of reserves, other mineralized material tons and grades are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and geostatistical relationships or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unpredictable. There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves and mineralized material and their corresponding grades. Until reserves and other mineralized materials are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of reserves and other mineralized materials may vary depending on the price of graphite and vanadium. Any material change in the quantity of reserves, other mineralized materials, mineralization or grade may affect the economic viability of our properties.\nTitle to the Coosa Project may be subject to defects in title or other claims, which could affect our property rights and claims.\nThere are risks that title to the Coosa Project may be challenged or impugned. There may be valid challenges to the title of the Coosa Project which, if successful, could impair development or operations. This is particularly the case because we hold our interest solely through a lease, as such interest is substantially based on contract as opposed to a direct interest in the property.\nThe lease agreements pursuant to which the Company has interests in the Coosa Project provide that the Company must make a series of cash payments over certain time periods. Failure by the Company to make such payments in a timely fashion may result in the Company losing its interest in the Coosa Project. There can be no assurance that the Company will have, or be able to obtain, the necessary financial resources to be able to maintain the lease agreements in good standing, or to be able to comply with all of its obligations thereunder, which could result in the Company forfeiting its interest in the Coosa Project.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely impact investor confidence and results and increase the likelihood of securities class action litigation.\nOur common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. During 2020, the sale price of our common stock ranged from a high of $14.50 per share to a low of $0.25 per share. Volatility in our stock price can be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, market conditions in the energy materials industry, announcements that we may make regarding our business plans or strategy, including announcements concerning our anticipated battery-graphite business or the sale of our uranium assets to enCore Energy in a transaction that closed on December 31, 2020, the substantial increase in the sale and issuance of shares of our common stock to finance our operations and the accuracy of expectations and predictions of analysts and the market as they pertain to our future business prospects. In addition, the price of our common stock may increase or decrease substantially for reasons unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. If our common stock continues to experience substantial price volatility, any shares investors purchase may rapidly lose some or substantially all of their value.\nShareholders of a public company sometimes bring securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the market price of that company\u2019s securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management\u2019s attention and other resources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration is impacted by the price of our common stock. A low stock price may adversely impact our ability to fund our operating and growth plans, including the Coosa Graphite Project, which would harm our business and prospects.\nThe Company has no history of paying dividends on its common stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company has not previously paid dividends on its common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of\nDirectors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nTerms of subsequent financings may adversely impact holders of our securities.\nIn order to finance our future production plans and working capital needs, we may have to raise funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Depending on the type and the terms of any financing we pursue, holders of our securities\u2019 rights and the value of their investment in our common stock could be reduced. A financing could involve one or more types of securities including common stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire common stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock. We currently have no authorized preferred stock. In addition, if we issue secured debt securities, the holders of the debt would have a claim to our assets that would be prior to the rights of holders of our other securities until the debt is paid. Interest on these debt securities would increase costs and negatively impact operating results. If the issuance of new securities results in diminished rights to holders of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\nShareholders would be diluted if we use common stock to raise capital, and the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe plan to seek additional capital to carry out our business plan. This financing could involve one or more types of securities including common stock, convertible debt or warrants to acquire common stock. These securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock could be dilutive to existing holders of our securities and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOn December 4, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $100,000,000 of our common stock. The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period commencing after the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, which conditions were satisfied on January 7, 2021. As of February 11, 2021, we have received $6.6 million in aggregate gross proceeds from prior sales of 0.9 million shares under the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nAfter Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.", "PERMNO": 75672, "SIC": 1090, "TIC": "WWR"}
