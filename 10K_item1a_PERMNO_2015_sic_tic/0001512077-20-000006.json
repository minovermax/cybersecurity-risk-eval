RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing economic and technological environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Investing in our common stock involves substantial risks. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur substantial indebtedness and limited cash on hand may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and subject us to various reporting and financial covenants that we may be unable to comply with. The failure to remain in compliance with those covenants could cause our creditors to accelerate our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition and may cause us to seek bankruptcy protection.\nWe currently have a significant amount of indebtedness and could in the future incur additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had $506.0 million aggregate principal amount in senior secured term loans (the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement (the \u201c2017 Credit Agreement\u201d). In addition, we had $43.3 million drawn under the 2017 Revolving Loans (excluding approximately $4.3 million in letters of credit outstanding thereunder), with remaining availability thereunder of approximately $37.4 million as of December 31, 2019; $178.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Second Lien Notes, including $28.0 million of payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest converted to principal since issuance; $82.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2035; and other debt outstanding of $23.7 million.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under credit facility, and cash from liquidity-generating transactions. On February 28, 2020, as a precautionary measure to ensure financial flexibility and maintain maximum liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company further leveraged the balance sheet, and drew down the remaining $41.8 million under the Revolving Credit Facility with a corresponding increase in cash on hand. Following the Drawdown, the Company has no remaining borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. A substantial amount of the Company's cash requirements are for debt service obligations. The Company has generated operating losses in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. Additionally, the Company has incurred net losses and had negative cash flows from operations for each of these years primarily as a result of significant cash interest payments arising from the Company's substantial debt balance. Net cash used in operations was $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 which included cash paid for interest of $56.6 million. Working capital deficiency increased by $42.9 million, to $63.3 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $20.4 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company's current forecast indicates it will continue to incur net losses and generate negative cash flows from operating activities as a result of the Company's indebtedness and significant related interest expense. At December 31, 2019, the Company had debt maturities totaling $15.7 million, $29.9 million and $623.3 million in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nOur substantial debt combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, as well as significant expenses in connection with our efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could have significant adverse consequences on our business and financial condition. For example:\n\u2022\nIf we fail to meet payment obligations or otherwise default under our debt, the lenders will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us. We do not expect that we could repay all of our outstanding indebtedness if the repayment of such indebtedness was accelerated.\n\u2022\nWe are required to comply with a financial covenant that requires us to maintain, as of any test period, a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (the \u201cLeverage Ratio\u201d), as defined under our senior secured credit agreement entered into on January 6, 2017, as amended from time to time, the \u201c2017 Credit Agreement\u201d). Such ratio is used to define the applicable rate on outstanding debt and fees and used to determine compliance for additional working capital and acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the results required to comply with this covenant in one or more quarters over the next twelve months, we may be required to take specific actions, including but not limited to, additional reductions in headcount and targeted procurement initiatives to further reduce operating costs, or alternatively, seek a waiver or an amendment from our lenders. If we are unable to satisfy our financial covenants or obtain a waiver or an amendment from our lenders, or take other remedial measures, we will be in default under our credit facilities, which would enable lenders thereunder to accelerate the repayment of amounts outstanding and exercise remedies with respect to the collateral. If any of our lenders under our credit facilities demand immediate payment, we will not have sufficient cash to repay such indebtedness. In addition, a default under our credit facilities or the lenders exercising their remedies thereunder could trigger cross-default provisions in our other indebtedness and certain other operating agreements. Our ability to amend our credit facilities or otherwise obtain waivers from our lenders depends on matters that are outside of our control and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in that regard. In addition, any covenant breach or event of default could harm our credit rating and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain financing if we are required to repurchase the convertible notes, which could cause us to default under the indenture. A default under the indenture would also cause an event of default under our 2017 Credit Agreement, which, at the election of the requisite majority of lenders, could cause all outstanding indebtedness under our 2017 Credit Agreement to become immediately due and payable. An acceleration under the indenture would also cause an event of default under our Second Lien Notes, which, at the election of the requisite majority of holders, could cause all outstanding indebtedness under our Second Lien Notes to become immediately due and payable.\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements could be limited. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our revolving credit facility is conditioned upon the absence of defaults and our ability to make certain representations and warranties. Failure to meet our borrowing conditions under our revolving credit facility could materially and adversely impact our liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur debt imposes operating and financial covenants and restrictions on us, and compliance with such covenants and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt at favorable rates, or at all, to adequately finance\nour operations or capital needs, pursue attractive business opportunities that may arise, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay dividends, sell assets and make capital expenditures.\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in our 2017 Credit Agreement and the securities purchase agreement governing our Second Lien Notes due June 30, 2023 (as amended, the \u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d), which include covenants requiring us to timely file our audited and unaudited financial statements, could result in an event of default on our debt.\n\u2022\nWe could experience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates, if our borrowings bear interest at variable rates or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher.\n\u2022\nUnless the terms of our 2017 Credit Agreement otherwise permit cash interest payments, all interest payments on our Second Lien Notes must be paid in-kind through maturity, which will increase the outstanding principal amount on such notes and further increase our substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In the recent past, our business has not generated positive cash flows from operating activities and may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause the related risks to intensify. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before their respective maturities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of any new debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than are currently in place. In addition, our revolving credit facility is subject to the absence of defaults and our ability to make certain representations and warranties. Failure to meet our borrowing conditions under our revolving credit facility could materially and adversely impact our liquidity.\nAs further described herein, to service our debt obligations and to fund our operations and our capital expenditures, we require a significant amount of cash to meet our needs, which depends on many factors beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will be able to create the required liquidity. Our ability to meet our obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business for the next 12 months will depend on our ability to achieve forecasted results, our ability to conserve cash, our ability to obtain necessary waivers from Lenders and other Equity Stakeholders to achieve sufficient cash interest savings therefrom and our ability to complete other liquidity-generating transactions. Based on the uncertainty of achieving these actions and the significance of the forecasted future negative cash flows resulting from our substantial debt balance, including anticipated future cash interest payments our management has determined that there is substantial doubt as to the our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months following May 14, 2020.\nIf we are unable to complete any of the actions described in the paragraph above, or otherwise generate incremental liquidity, or if there are material adverse developments in our business, results of operations or liquidity, we may be forced to further reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures, sell material assets, seek additional capital or be required to file for bankruptcy court protection. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nOur audited financial statements included a statement that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and a continuation of negative financial trends could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as described below, our management has determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent auditors have included a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. The reaction of investors, suppliers and others to Management\u2019s conclusion that there is substantial doubt, and our potential inability to continue as a going concern, could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the covenants in our senior secured credit facilities include a requirement that we receive an opinion from our auditors in connection with our year-end audit that is not subject to a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification or exception. On April 15, 2020, the entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and obtained a waiver related to obtaining a \u201cgoing\nconcern\u201d or like qualification or exception opinion for the year-end December 31, 2019 financial statements. We cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain additional covenant waivers or amendments in the future which may have a material adverse effect on the our results of operations or liquidity. Even if we are able to successfully manage our liquidity challenges through the end of the first quarter of 2021, if we are unable to improve our liquidity forecast for 2021 and refinance or extend a significant portion of our substantial 2022 debt maturities prior to the completion of the audit of our 2020 financial statements, we anticipate that our management will conclude that there is substantial doubt, and our potential inability to continue as a going concern, and, if we are unable to obtain a waiver of the covenant in the senior secured credit facilities that requires us to deliver an unqualified auditor\u2019s opinion, it will trigger a default under the senior secured credit facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such a waiver or amendment.\nIf our projected operating results fail to improve we could violate additional debt covenants, our liquidity could be further adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of funding. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our borrowing base availability, raise additional capital to fund our operations, or that debt or equity financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. If our operating results fail to improve, then our financial condition could render us unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe rapid spread of contagious illnesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by outbreaks of contagious disease such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. As of the time of this filing, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and the profitability of our joint venture interests. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, most of our airline and cruise line customers have temporarily ceased, and/or severely reduced, operations in certain markets. The spread of COVID-19 or associated strains has had and could continue to have a significant adverse impact on the demand for worldwide travel and, as a result, our financial results. Moreover, travel restrictions and operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in parts of the world where we have significant operations may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could have a material adverse effect on demand for our end customers\u2019 products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The resulting economic downturn can also negatively impact our stock price.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could further negatively impact our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There could be a prolonged impact on our business due to slow economic recovery or changes in consumer behavior. We currently anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements during the next twelve months primarily with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances. However, if we have sustained decrease in consumer demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may require access to additional capital. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional capital or to extend or refinance our existing borrowing agreements, if needed, as we have no remaining borrowing under the current Revolving Credit Facility following our draw down of the available $41.8 million on February 28, 2020.\nOur results of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 have been negatively impacted and our results for the full fiscal year could continue to be negatively impacted in ways we are not able to predict today, including, but not limited to, non-cash write-downs and asset impairment charges (including impairments on property and equipment, operating lease right-of use assets and goodwill); unrealized gains or losses related to investments; foreign currency fluctuations; and collections of accounts receivables. Additionally, payments to certain vendors have not been made in accordance with payment terms. To date, no critical vendors have stopped providing goods or services. However, there is no assurance that this will continue. If a critical vendor were to discontinue doing business with us this could have a material adverse impact on our results. We are continuing to monitor the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business is dependent on the travel industry and the competitive nature of that industry; it makes our business sensitive to domestic and international economic conditions.\nOur business is directly affected by the number of passengers flying on commercial airlines and traveling on cruise ships, the financial condition of these airlines and cruise lines, and the general availability of travel and related economic conditions around the world. As demand for air and maritime travel has declined due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, throughout the world, the number of aircraft, flights and cruise line passengers available to use our Connectivity and Media & Content offerings has also rapidly declined, which is having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. Further, due to the fears and restrictions involved with travel in the near term, sales of airline and cruise ship tickets for future travel appear to be well below\nexpectations and there is significant uncertainty about when passenger levels will begin to \u201cramp up\u201d. Additionally, current high unemployment rates are adversely affecting the travel and mobility markets, as well as reduced consumer and business spending and U.S. and global recessionary concerns. A general reduction or shift in discretionary spending has and will result in decreased demand for leisure and business travel and lead to a reduction in the number of airline flights or cruise lines offered, the number of passengers flying or taking cruises and the willingness of airlines and cruise lines to commit to spending funds on items such as our Connectivity and Media & Content offerings.\nMany of our airline and maritime customers operate in intensely competitive environments. These competitive circumstances could cause one or more of our customers to reduce expenditures on passenger and guest services, including our Connectivity and Media & Content services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial condition. If we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in customer needs and technology, our business may be negatively affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop, implement and offer products, services and solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and customer preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis, and our products, services and solutions may not be successful in the marketplace. In addition, products, services, solutions and technologies developed by current or future competitors may make our products, service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete. Any one of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to obtain and successfully offer our products and services. Furthermore, focusing on core business risks and immediate risks may allow for other factors to go unattended and grow into potentially material risks. In addition, residual risks (risk that remains after the initial risk is managed) can turn into core and immediate risks if undetected or not managed.\nNegative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, investors, employees, advisors and vendors. Additionally, our ability to attract, retain and serve our customers may be negatively impacted by service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to equipment or software defects or errors.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our Company. In addition, our ability to source necessary equipment and supplies from vendors may be affected by negative perceptions of our Company, including any actual or perceived inability to pay our vendors in a timely manner and our low stock price. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including any perceived or actual weakness in our technological, cybersecurity, or other security breaches resulting in improper disclosure of customer or employee personal information, unethical behavior and misconduct by our employees, advisors and counterparties. Further, lawsuits pertaining to personnel\u2019s classification, such as contingent workforce, and wrongful termination claims can lead to increased cost (in both defending and settling of such claims) and deteriorating the Company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these and other matters could damage our reputation among customers, investors, employees, advisors and vendors and adversely affect our businesses.\nAdditionally, our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depends, in part, upon the reliable performance of our satellite transponder capacity, network infrastructure and connectivity system. The uninterrupted operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage from fire, flood, earthquakes, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cyber-attacks, acts of war or terrorism and similar events or factors beyond our control. Our Connectivity segment has experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, including infrastructure, component and service failures that cause service disruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation could be harmed, and our customers may have the right to terminate their contracts with us or pursue other remedies. Any such impact to our reputation or ability to attract, retain and serve our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our Connectivity services is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when software is first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Any defects or errors, particularly those that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in termination or failure to renew contracts by our airline customers, reputational risk and reductions in sales or sales credits or refunds to our customers. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and reputation could be materially harmed as a result of cybersecurity attacks, data breaches, data theft, unauthorized access or hacking.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. In addition, because we engage suppliers and vendors to process personal and payment card information of our customers and end-users, our business is dependent on the security and performance of the information technology systems of those suppliers and vendors. While we select these third-party suppliers and vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from cyber-attacks and security breaches at a supplier or vendor, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. An increasing number of companies have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their computer networks. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often, and as a result the techniques are often not recognized until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate such threatening techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures to protect our business from cyber and similar unauthorized attacks on our information technology systems. Despite our efforts to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, including continuously working to install new, and upgrade our existing, information technology systems and increasing employee awareness around phishing, spoofing, malware, and other cyber risks, there is no guarantee that such measures will be successful in protecting us from a cyber-attacks. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex, and sophisticated global cyber threats. Any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our suppliers or vendors, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard our customers\u2019 information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have not been fully remediated. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the \u201c2018 Form 10-K\u201d). These related to our entity level controls, financial statement close and reporting process, general information technology controls, intercompany process, inventory, content library, internally developed software, long lived assets, goodwill impairment, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, revenue processes, cost of sales and related accruals, income taxes, payroll, treasury, and business combination. Our material weaknesses related to the intercompany process, content library, payroll and treasury have been remediated in 2019, but we can give no assurance that the remediated material weakness will continue to be effective. The remaining material weaknesses have not been fully remediated in 2019.\nWe believe these material weaknesses are the result of the growth of our Company through mergers and acquisition (\u201cM&A\u201d), insufficient M&A integration, insufficient automation in our financial reporting environment, increased complexity of our business transactions, increased decentralization of our operations. In retrospect, we have concluded that the above-described changes to our business were not adequately supported by the hiring of additional personnel with sufficient, specific expertise in accounting, finance and information technology. For additional information about the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nWe will continue to expend significant financial and information-technology resources to remediate these material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as well as to perform additional procedures to compensate for our material weaknesses and deficiencies in order to complete our financial statement closing. The process of remediating these material weaknesses and deficiencies will divert the attention of management and other resources from our ongoing business, and this remediation process may require greater than one-year to complete.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce financial statements in a timely manner or without material misstatements. The material weaknesses and deficiencies that we have identified may impair our ability to timely identify and forecast certain business trends and certain aspects of our financial performance which could affect our operational performance. Our failure to timely produce financial statements may also constitute defaults or give rise to penalties under our debt instruments if we are unable to comply with our reporting covenants. Nasdaq could also delist our common stock if we are delinquent in our SEC filings, thereby impairing the trading liquidity of our common stock. A delisting would trigger the repurchase option under the indenture governing our convertible notes (as further described under\n\u201cRisks Relating to our Common Stock\u201d) and have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to remediate our material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, investors, customers, rating agencies, lenders or others may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our securities could decline, we could be subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or litigation that results in substantial fines, penalties or liabilities and we may be unable to raise funds from debt and equity investors on terms favorable to us, if at all.\nWe have expended significant time and resources and expect to expend additional time and resources in connection with our efforts to remediate our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could divert management\u2019s attention from our business, reduce our liquidity and have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe have expended significant time and resources and expect to expend additional time and resources in connection with our efforts to remediate our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The time spent on remediation diverts our management\u2019s attention from focusing on operating and growing our business. In addition, the costs of remediation reduce our liquidity and have an adverse effect on our financial performance, and restructuring our business could constrain our liquidity further, requiring us to seek amendments or waivers to our credit agreement or obtain additional financing by issuing debt or equity securities.\nIf we issue equity, warrants or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have undertaken restructuring activities in the past, are currently undertaking such activities and may determine to undertake additional restructuring activities in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales.\nOur ability to reduce operating expenses is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take to reduce expenses, our commitment to our cost-savings plans, and our subsequent ability to execute and implement those plans and actions and realize expected cost savings. We may need to take additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our operations, reducing our headcount, or eliminating certain positions for a variety of reasons, including deterioration in market conditions or significant declines in demand for our products and services. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and services. We engaged a third-party management consulting firm, to assist with identifying and deploying Phase III cost savings initiatives in 2020. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and services, and could increase the cost of our products and services versus our projections, each of which could adversely impact our operating results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees and senior management with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results.\nWe operate internationally and our ability to expand in non-U.S. markets involves multiple risks that the company may not be able to mitigate.\nWe operate in numerous countries around the world and intend to continue to expand the number of countries in which we operate. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets and the possibility that there may not be returns on these investments in the near future comparable to our recent financial results or at all. We may need to adopt technological solutions for broadband Internet that are different than those we deploy domestically, we may be unable to find content or service providers to partner with on commercially reasonable terms for foreign markets, or at all, and we cannot provide assurance that changes in geopolitics will not result in restrictions on the expansion of our business, such as restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers or the establishment of economic sanctions by the United States affecting businesses such as ours. In addition, in expanding our operations internationally, we expose our business to the risks and uncertainties relating to the international financial markets, compliance with international regulations and policies, the complexity of managing foreign operations and human resources and more acute exposure to the impact of international governmental and political changes and conflicts.\nMany of the countries in which we operate have legal systems that are less developed and less predictable than the legal systems in the United States, and, as a result, our international expansion exposes us to potential increased costs and uncertainties.\nNew rules and regulations may be enacted, or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to offer products and provide the services in the countries in which we wish to operate.\nThe long sales cycle of many of our Connectivity and Media & Content segment\u2019s products increases the difficulty of our expense planning and revenue forecasting and may cause us to expend substantial resources without any assurance of an acceptable financial return.\nMany of our products have long sales cycles that involve numerous steps, including initial customer contacts, specification writing, software engineering design, software prototyping, pilot testing, device certification, regulatory approvals, marketing and sales efforts and commercial manufacture, integration and delivery. During this cycle, we may expend substantial financial resources and management time and effort without any assurance or ability to predict when or if product sales will result. Delays in sales may cause us to expend significant resources without any assurance of an acceptable financial return and increases the difficulty of our expense planning and revenue forecasting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Company\u2019s revenue is largely dependent upon our existing relationship and agreement with Southwest Airlines.\nOur existing supply and services agreement with Southwest Airlines, entered into in December 2016 expires in December 2025, governs our supply of products and services to Southwest Airlines, including our broadband equipment, Wi-Fi service in connection with the use of our broadband system, live television-related services and certain additional contemplated services. Our Company is substantially dependent on this customer relationship. In addition, a significant source of our revenue and operating income is generated from the supply of live television-related services to Southwest Airlines. If we fail to maintain certain minimum service level requirements relating to such television service, or if we fail to meet other obligations relating to our technology, equipment or services, Southwest Airlines may have the right to terminate such service or the supply and services agreement. In addition, if any of Southwest\u2019s planes continue to be grounded for reasons outside of the airline\u2019s control, such as the grounding of its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, or its entire fleet due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Southwest Airlines may have the right to suspend its services obligations with us. Further, there is no guarantee that Southwest Airlines will continue to maintain historical levels of fleet installation growth with us. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our existing relationship with Southwest Airlines.\nWe may be unable to retain or attract Media & Content customers if we do not develop new products or enhance those we currently provide.\nThe IFE market is faced with rapid technological change, evolving standards in IFE and computer hardware, software development, communications and security infrastructure, and changing needs and expectations of customers. Building new products and service offerings requires significant investment in research and development. Our investment in software and other product development may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful, and the Company may be required to impair the capitalized value associated with those investments. We also face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products or that such products will result in the cost-savings and synergies that we anticipate.\nIn addition, a substantial portion of our research and development resources are devoted to maintenance requirements and product upgrades that address new technology support. These demands put significant constraints on the resources that we have available for new product development. If we are unable to develop new products or enhance those we currently provide in an environment of technological change and evolving standards and customer needs, we may be unable to retain or attract customers and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted as a result.\nBusinesses or technologies that we have acquired or invested in or that we may acquire or invest in could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may engage in acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our growth, and/or we may invest with third parties in certain U.S. and foreign markets. Acquisitions and investments involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions or investments may not advance our business strategy as much as expected, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may fail altogether. Any past or future acquisition or investment could also involve additional risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential impact on our ability to produce financial statements in a timely manner, which could in turn contribute to or cause our material weaknesses in our internal controls;\n\u2022\npotential distraction of management from our ongoing business and from the remediation of our material weaknesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business, which could result in delays in the realization of acquisition synergies;\n\u2022\nuse of cash to fund the acquisition or investment or for unanticipated expenses;\n\u2022\nlimited market experience in new businesses;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation involving any of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nadditional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval and other ongoing compliance matters;\n\u2022\nacquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\ncontrols in the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of equity method investments;\n\u2022\ndilution to our current stockholders from the potential issuance of equity securities to consummate a proposed acquisition or investment; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company.\nIn the event that we enter into any acquisition or investment agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust or national-security reviews or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions or investments, and, based on the negotiated terms of a particular transaction, we could assume all of the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions or investments.\nIn certain of our previously completed acquisitions, we agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments, or earnouts, based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses. We may use earnouts for acquisitions in the future. The performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us from the acquired business of certain specified benchmarks during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition. Future acquisitions or investments may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business or investment, grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses (which may be dilutive to existing stockholders), and expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt. The specific performance goals and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition. While we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations, our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value.\nAlthough we conducted due diligence in connection with the acquisitions and investments that we have already consummated, we cannot be certain that such diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in those businesses. It may not be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or there may be adverse factors outside of our control that later arise. Even if the due diligence that we conducted in connection with acquisitions or investments that we have already consummated or that we consummate in the future successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis.\nIn addition, we may be required to write down or write off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses with respect to any acquisitions or investments we consummate from time to time. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. Any such write-downs, write-offs, restructuring or charges could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may fail to realize the expected benefits of any acquisitions or investments as rapidly as the expectations of, or to the extent anticipated by, the marketplace, investors, financial analysts or industry analysts. Any such failure may have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nMost notably, we failed to realize the expected benefits following our acquisition of EMC. This resulted in a reduced assessment of our goodwill as a result of a significant decline in our market capitalization and lower than expected financial results in our Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting unit.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products or services offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, end of previous customer contracts, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA future act or threat of terrorism, threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts, wars, geopolitical disputes or other similar events could result in a prohibition on the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft and maritime vessels.\nA future act of terrorism, the threat of such acts or other airline or maritime accidents could have an adverse effect on the travel industry. In the event of a terrorist attack, terrorist or national security threat or other accident, conflict, war or other geopolitical dispute, the industry could experience significantly reduced passenger demand. The U.S. federal government could respond to such events by prohibiting the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft and maritime vessels, which would eliminate demand for our equipment and services. As an example, the U.S. and U.K. governments passed legislation in 2017 temporarily banning laptops, tablets and other portable electronic devices as carry-on devices on aircraft vessels traveling from several Muslim-majority countries. Even though the bans have been lifted, they remain potential responses to acts of terrorism and similar bans could adversely affect our business. In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or services and such attacks or accidents would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our equipment and services.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, adverse weather conditions or other environmental incidents could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be disrupted due to adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, power outages or other environmental incidents, wherever located around the world. Heightened geopolitical, economic and natural disaster risks, most notably in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, including the loss of IT infrastructure, physical infrastructure and key personnel along with failures to meet our contractual obligations to customers located in the areas and jurisdictions affected by the occurrence of catastrophic events.\nOur insurance policies may not fully cover all losses we may incur.\nAlthough we attempt to limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors or omissions through contractual provisions, the limitations of liability included in our contracts may not fully protect us from liability or damages and may not be enforceable in all instances. In addition, not all of our contracts may limit our exposure for certain liabilities, such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, this coverage may not continue to be available on terms reasonable to us or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, and our insurers may attempt to disclaim coverage as to future claims. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are excluded from our insurance coverage or that exceed our available insurance coverage, or changes in our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Director and Officer Insurance market is hardening which may lead certain insurers not to renew their policies, or underwrite new ones, leading to a more limited pool of insurers for us to access and potentially increasing our premiums.\nWe may be unable to renew agreements with existing customers or attract new customers on favorable terms or at all.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers and partners and attract new and repeat customers, including the availability, features and pricing of our services and dissatisfaction with our reliability, actual or perceived security risks and our financial viability.\nAdditionally, the terms of any future agreements with existing or new customers may be less favorable than our current agreements. We may ultimately fail in entering into agreements with additional customers on competitive terms, and that failure could harm our results of operations due to, among other factors, a diversion of resources and the actual costs of pursuing these opportunities. To the extent that we are unable to secure new customers or that any of our future agreements with existing or new customers are not as favorable as our existing arrangements, our growth and financial prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur customers may be unable to pay us for our services.\nThere is customer credit risk in the aviation and maritime industries in which we operate. Our customers include some companies that may, from time to time, encounter financial difficulties. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, most of our airline and cruise line customers have temporarily ceased, and/or severely reduced, operations in certain markets, which could in the future have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide travel. To help mitigate the situation, Governments around the world are providing meaningful assistance to airlines. However, some airlines and cruise line customers may ultimately file for bankruptcy protection.\nIf a customer\u2019s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable balance and unbilled services. Some of our customers have experienced bankruptcies in the past, and we have not been able to recover the outstanding amounts owed to us. The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account balance owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, during 2019, Jet Airways and Aigle Azur declared bankruptcy and as a result we may not be able to recover the amount owed to us. In addition, in 2018, Avianca Brazil entered into a judicial recovery proceeding, and as a result we may be unable to recover the outstanding amounts it owes to us.\nFailure to retain key members of senior management could harm our business.\nOur business depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management team. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our segments and their operations. As a result, if any of these individuals were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors. In addition, the loss of key members of senior management, as well as other key personnel, especially those who are highly skilled, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. Furthermore, we may experience a loss of productivity while new members of senior management integrate into our business. For example, in the first quarter of 2019, our SVP & Chief Information Officer terminated employment with us and in the second and third quarters of 2019, we appointed a new Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, respectively. The process of transitioning these and other executives into their respective roles will require significant time and financial resources, and the transition may not ultimately be successful.\nWe may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled personnel that are necessary to remain competitive and execute the growth strategy of our business.\nOur business depends on the continued service and performance of key technical personnel. Such individuals have acquired specialized technical knowledge and skills with respect to our business and operations and some have terminated employment with us as a result of ordinary-course attrition and our restructuring activities. We may face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors or project specific personnel and thus could experience a loss of productivity and/or an increase in the cost of labor. In addition, much of our key technology and systems are designed and operated by our personnel. The loss of key technical personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. Additionally, due to the Company\u2019s presence in diverse global geographic locations, failure to identify and manage local cultural expectations may also result in an increased employee attrition.\nThe structure of our investment in the WMS joint venture subjects us to risks that may limit our anticipated cash distributions from such investment or prevent us from receiving its anticipated benefits.\nWe own a 49% equity interest in WMS, a provider of global cellular roaming services to off-shore vessels. WMS\u2019s managing member owns a 51% equity interest in the WMS joint venture, has the right to nominate three of WMS\u2019s five voting board members and controls the day-to-day operations of WMS. WMS\u2019s profits and losses for any fiscal year are allocated between our joint-venture partner and the Company in proportion to percentage interests owned, after giving effect to any applicable special allocations. The WMS joint venture operating agreement provides for annual cash distributions to us and our joint-venture partner,\nbut those distributions are subject to reduction for certain expenses and other items relating to WMS\u2019s operations, including capital expenditures, as determined by WMS\u2019s board (which we do not control). As a result, we may not receive all or part of our anticipated cash distributions in any period for reasons beyond our control.\nIn addition, our investment in WMS is further subject to various risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe impact of contagious illnesses (including COVID-19) which may adversely impact passenger demand for cellular roaming services or cause itinerary restrictions for cruise ships;\n\u2022\nOur interests could diverge from our joint-venture partner\u2019s interests or we may not agree with our joint-venture partner on ongoing activities or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in WMS;\n\u2022\nWMS profits and cash flows may prove inadequate to fund cash dividends or other distributions to us, or those amounts may be subject to reduction as noted above;\n\u2022\nThe carrying value of our interest in WMS could exceed the fair value requiring the recognition of additional impairment of the investment value (for a discussion on the impairment history of WMS, refer to Note 8. Equity Method Investments to the consolidated financial statements);\n\u2022\nOur control over the operations of and other decisions relating to WMS is limited;\n\u2022\nDue to differing business models or long-term business goals, our joint-venture partner may decide not to fund capital investments in WMS, impairing the value of the WMS joint venture;\n\u2022\nWe may lose the rights to technology or products being developed by WMS, including if our joint-venture partner is acquired by another company, or experiences financial or other losses;\n\u2022\nMany of the contractors on which WMS relies are with our joint-venture partner, and \u201cseconded\u201d to WMS from our joint-venture partner, such that WMS relies on these contractors, personnel and other resources provided to it by our joint-venture partner;\n\u2022\nWe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from WMS; and\n\u2022\nThe potential sale of WMS, which would provide additional liquidity, may not be consummated.\nWe are subject to a variety of complex U.S. and foreign tax laws and regimes as a result of our global footprint, and changes in those laws-or our failure to properly interpret them-may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide our products and services globally. As a result, we are subject to a variety of complex U.S. and foreign tax laws and regimes, and changes in those laws and regimes-and our failure to properly conduct our operations in compliance with them-could be costly and expose us to fines, penalties or tax obligations that we did not anticipate. This could occur due to, among other things, unclear or unsettled tax laws, lack of clarity as to whether we have \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d exposure, intercompany charges, value-added tax and income tax-liability in some countries where we conduct operations. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regimes, or increased enforcement activity by tax regulators, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be severely limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in the ownership of its equity over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We had an ownership change in the second quarter of 2019 in connection with the sale by PAR Investment Partners, L.P. of all of its stock in our company, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $427.2 million, and our ability to utilize those net operating loss carryforwards will be limited by the \u201cownership change\u201d as described above, which could result in increased tax liability.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to make claims for investment tax credits in Canada.\nOur Canadian subsidiary, DTI Software, makes claims for currently available tax credits in Canada in the course of its development of games and applications in Canada, including tax credits that support multimedia, e-commerce and research and development in Canada. If governmental authorities in Canada, and, in particular, in the province of Quebec, were to reduce or eliminate the amount of tax credits that are available in respect of these activities by DTI, then our tax liabilities would likely increase, and our overall profitability would be negatively impacted.\nInterest Rate Risk.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $549 million of floating rate debt consisting of two term loans and six revolver tranches. These debt obligations were tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), which is a variable rate index used by most lenders. The underlying credit agreements provide the ability to make interest rate elections tied to either the Prime Rate or LIBOR. During 2019, we made LIBOR elections for our floating rate debt obligations, as it was lower than the stated Prime Rate at all election opportunities. In 2021, we will eliminate LIBOR as our benchmark. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the impact LIBOR\u2019s replacement will have on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nAlthough we have established procedures to monitor and manage interest rate risk, changes in an unfavorable direction may increase the interest payable on our outstanding debt obligations. An increase in interest expense may have a negative effect on our liquidity and financial results.\nForeign Currency Risk.\nA portion of our international revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore, exposes us to foreign currency risk. We operate in 15 non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies, with our greatest exposure being to the Euro. At December 31, 2019, we held approximately 15% of our total cash balances in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies.\nAdditionally, global markets and foreign currencies may be adversely impacted by political, economic and other developments in the E.U., Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. Although we have established procedures and controls to manage the risks that arise from our foreign business operations, the effect of unfavorable changes in the exchange rates of these non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business and results of operations.\nThe potential impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referenced to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d the uncertainty regarding effect of the ultimate terms of Brexit and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. have affected, and may continue to affect, business activity, political stability and economic and market conditions in the U.K., the Eurozone, the E.U. and elsewhere and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the Euro and the British Pound.\nAdditionally, with the U.K. no longer being a part of the E.U., there may be certain regulatory changes that may impact the regulatory regime under which we operate in both the U.K. and the E.U. Given that a portion of our business is conducted in the E.U., U.K., any of these and other changes, implications and consequences may adversely affect our customers in the region and our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Indebtedness\nWe may not have the ability to repay the principal amount of our Second Lien Notes at their maturity, to make the cash interest payments on such notes when due or to raise the funds necessary to repurchase our Second Lien Notes upon a change of control.\nOn March 27, 2018, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes due 2023. Interest on our Second Lien Notes is initially payable in kind (compounded semi-annually) at a rate of 12.0% per annum. Unless the terms of our 2017 Credit Agreement otherwise permit cash interest payments, all interest payments on our Second Lien Notes must be paid in-kind through maturity. While interest on our Second Lien Notes is paid in kind, the outstanding principal amount on such notes will increase and our 2017 Credit Agreement restricts us from voluntarily making cash payments on our Second Lien Notes (including interest thereon). Upon a change of control (as defined in the securities purchase agreement governing our Second Lien Notes), we must offer to repurchase the Second Lien Notes from the noteholders at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of, plus accrued and unpaid interest on, our Second Lien Notes will become due and payable by us. Our Second Lien Notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees our 2017 Credit Agreement.\nWe may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, at the time we are required to repay our Second Lien Notes upon maturity or repurchase such notes upon a change of control. In addition, our ability to repurchase our Second Lien Notes may be limited by agreements governing our indebtedness (such as our 2017 Credit Agreement). Our inability to make any cash payments that may be required to satisfy the obligations described above would trigger an event of\ndefault under our Second Lien Notes, which in turn could constitute an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness, thereby potentially resulting in the acceleration of certain of such indebtedness, the prepayment of which could further restrict our ability to satisfy such cash obligations, and cause our lenders and debtholders to foreclose upon the assets securing our Second Lien Notes and certain other indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes at maturity, to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible notes or to repurchase our convertible notes upon a fundamental change or on specified repurchase dates, and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase our convertible notes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding approximately $82.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the \u201cconvertible notes\u201d). At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of our convertible notes will become due and payable by us. Upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the indenture for the convertible notes) (including among other things, if our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq) or upon each of February 20, 2022, February 22, 2025 and February 22, 2030, holders of convertible notes will also have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of our convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and any additional amounts that may be required under the agreements governing such notes. In addition, upon conversion of our convertible notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of our convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain financing at favorable terms, or at all, at the time we are required to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes, make repurchases of our convertible notes or settle conversions of our convertible notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase our convertible notes may be limited by law, regulatory action or agreements governing our indebtedness.\nFurthermore, certain transactions or events that would give holders of our convertible notes the right to put our convertible notes back to us or to convert our convertible notes with an increased conversion rate may constitute events of default under our 2017 Credit Agreement and the purchase agreement governing our Second Lien Notes. Our failure to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes, repurchase convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture (including, among other things, if our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq), or to settle conversions of our convertible notes would constitute a default under the indenture. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase our convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversion thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our convertible notes is triggered (including, among other things, if our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq), holders of convertible notes will be entitled to convert our convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity as we may not have funds currently available to settle this obligation. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which may result in a material increase in our working capital deficit.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible notes because they may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects our economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for our convertible notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of our convertible notes. As a result, we have recorded, and will continue to record, a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current period presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of our convertible notes to their face amount over the term of our convertible notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the\ndebt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of our convertible notes.\nIn addition, because our convertible notes may be settled entirely or partly in cash, under certain circumstances, our convertible notes are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of our convertible notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe fundamental-change repurchase feature of the indenture governing our convertible notes, as well as the change of control repurchase feature of the securities purchase agreement governing our Second Lien Notes, may increase the price of or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe indenture governing our convertible notes requires us to repurchase our convertible notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. In addition, the securities purchase agreement governing our Second Lien Notes and the indenture governing our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes for cash upon the occurrence of a change of control. A takeover may trigger the requirement that we repurchase one or both of our Second Lien Notes and our convertible notes and/or increase the conversion rate on our convertible notes, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a combinatory transaction with us. Such additional costs may have the effect of preventing a Company takeover that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nExercise or conversion of our Searchlight warrants and/ or convertible notes, may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nOn March 27, 2018, we issued Searchlight Capital (\u201cSearchlight\u201d) warrants to acquire approximately 0.7 million shares of our common stock for $0.25 per share (\u201cPenny Warrants\u201d). The Penny Warrants are exercisable commencing January 21, 2021, but only if the average 45-day volume-weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of our common stock equals or exceeds $100.00 per share for 45 consecutive trading days after March 27, 2018. We also issued Searchlight warrants to purchase an additional 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $39.25 per share, which are exercisable commencing on January 1, 2021. The exercise of some or all of the warrants and/or the conversion of some or all of our convertible notes (if we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such convertible notes) will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. The dilution from any warrant exercise and/ or conversion of our convertible notes could be substantial. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise or conversion or any anticipated sales upon exercise of the warrants or conversion of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. These factors also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock, warrants or convertible securities, and could adversely impact the terms under which we could obtain additional equity capital. In addition, the existence of our convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions.\nRisks Related to Our Connectivity Segment\nThe success of our Connectivity segment depends on the investment in and development of new broadband technologies and advanced communications and secure networking systems, products and services and antenna technologies, as well as their market acceptance.\nBroadband, advanced communications and secure networking markets are subject to rapid technological change, frequent new and enhanced product and service introductions, product obsolescence and changes in user requirements. Our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to develop leading technologies in existing and emerging broadband, advanced communications and secure networking markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop, introduce and sell new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis that respond to ever-changing customer requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to enhance our product and service offerings by continuing to increase satellite capacity, bandwidth cost efficiencies and service quality and adding innovative features that differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nsuccessful integration of various elements of our complex technologies and system architectures;\n\u2022\ntimely completion and introduction of new system and product designs;\n\u2022\nachievement of acceptable product and service costs;\n\u2022\nestablishment of close working relationships with major customers for the design of their new communications and secure networking systems incorporating our products and services;\n\u2022\nmarketing and pricing strategies of our competitors with respect to competitive products and services; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our new products and services.\nWe cannot guarantee that our current or future technology, product or service offerings in our Connectivity segment will be successful or that any of those technologies, products or services we offer will achieve sufficient market acceptance. Our Connectivity segment may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from successfully selecting, developing, manufacturing or marketing new technologies, products or services, and these efforts could divert our attention and resources from other projects. We cannot be sure that such efforts and expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or divert resources from other projects. In addition, defects may be found in our products after we begin deliveries that could result in degradation of service quality, and the delay or loss of market acceptance. If we are unable to design, manufacture, integrate and market profitable new products and services for existing or emerging markets, it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face increased demand for greater bandwidth, speed and performance from customers in an increasingly competitive environment featuring new technologies and market entrants, which may require us to maintain increased service levels at higher costs and make significant investments in improving our Connectivity platform.\nCompetition among providers of connectivity solutions, including satellite providers who can leverage their own gateways and satellite constellations to provide connectivity solutions directly to customers, may impact prices received for such services. Moreover, if take-rates and passenger demand increase, we may be forced to expend substantial financial and other resources for future capacity, infrastructure and related technologies to ensure that we meet such demands from our current and future customers, which may not be recovered or reimbursed by our customers. The costs of obtaining current and future satellite capacity may also be affected by limitations in global satellite capacity. Should demand increase for greater bandwidth, speed and performance beyond our current capabilities, we may be required to increase our investment in improving our Connectivity solution or to leverage our existing platform, including our Media & Content services offerings, to further develop and deploy more cost-effective connectivity solutions.\nWe may experience future customer attrition as satellite capacity providers enter into arrangements directly with customers.\nWe rely on satellite providers to secure the satellite capacity needed to conduct our Connectivity operations and provide Connectivity services to customers. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the capacity needed to conduct our operations at current rates and levels moving forward, or to obtain capacity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Satellite manufacturers, satellite owners and other satellite providers seek to enter into arrangements directly with our customers for satellite capacity and services. As a result, we may experience customer attrition and may be unable to compete with satellite providers who could offer greater pricing flexibility and satellite capacity options given their place in the supply chain. Our failure to compete with satellite providers, or new-entrant providers, and offer favorable pricing arrangements to customers could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on \u201csole source\u201d service providers and other third parties for certain key components of, and services relating to, our Connectivity segment.\nWe currently source key components of our hardware and key features of our Connectivity services from sole providers of equipment and network services. If we experience a disruption in the delivery of products and services from any of our key providers, it may be difficult for us to continue providing our own products and services to our customers. We have experienced component delivery issues in the past and there can be no assurance that we will avoid similar issues in the future. In addition, the supply of third-party components in general could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships with such third parties, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers, a significant decline in their financial conditions, or a disruption in manufacturing caused by contagious illnesses or pandemics such as COVID-19. If we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our Connectivity segment, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, any loss of preferred relationships that we have with our\nhardware providers today could eliminate our competitive advantage in the use of satellites for in-flight connectivity in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may need to materially increase our investments in product development and equipment in connection with our efforts to grow our Connectivity segment\u2019s service lines and remain competitive in the future, which the Company could be unable to do if it is liquidity constrained.\nWe have historically incurred significant product development expenses to support the growth of our Connectivity services and offerings. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources as we continue to grow our Connectivity segment and increase our investments in satellite-based technologies. As product development efforts progress, such as flat panel antenna development, expansion of satellite-based capabilities including testing of NGSO constellations, and capital investments in Connectivity equipment for new and existing customers, the costs of our Connectivity segment may materially fluctuate in future periods which could negatively affect future operating results. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to numerous variables, including the availability and timing of next-generation technologies, the need and related costs to develop and implement changes to our software and hardware to be competitive and, with respect to satellite technologies, the need and related costs of obtaining current and future capacity. The capital investments and related costs may be significant, and we may have insufficient liquidity or resources to make those investments in the future.\nThe failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, requiring us to pay significant damages and impairing our ability to offer our Connectivity services.\nThe products offered by our Connectivity segment contain complex systems and components that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technologies. If any of our Connectivity products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such events could result in significant expenses and material liabilities, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. If our Connectivity segment\u2019s on-board equipment has a severe malfunction or if there is a problem with equipment installation which damages an aircraft or maritime vessel or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to material product liability claims or costly repair obligations. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any such claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our indemnity obligations to our enterprise customers may include losses due to third-party claims (such as from their end-users, e.g., their passengers) and, in certain cases, the causes for such losses may include failure of our products. Such indemnity obligations are difficult to quantify but may result in significant expenses. In addition to such costs, any material defects or errors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could impair our ability to continue to offer our Connectivity services in the future.\nSatellite failures or degradations in satellite performance could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use leased and Company-owned satellite capacity to support our broadband services for our Connectivity segment. Satellites utilize complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and, accordingly, are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions (commonly referred to as anomalies), interference from electrostatic storms, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris. The satellites we employ for our Connectivity segment have experienced various anomalies in the past and will likely experience anomalies in the future. Anomalies can occur as a result of various factors, such as satellite manufacturer error, whether due to the use of new or largely unproven technology or due to a design, manufacturing or assembly defect that was not discovered before launch and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the space environment. As the Company made a decision not to insure AMC-1 and AMC-3 geosynchronous communications satellites, any failures of these satellites may result in material financial implications for the Company.\nAdditionally, the Company uses inclined orbit satellites for some of its services which do not remain in a zero-degree inclination orbit. Their remaining useful life is a function of how long the remaining fuel can be used to maintain an acceptable orbit inclination to allow us to provide services to our customers. Once the onboard fuel has been exhausted, these satellites are no longer able to provide useful services.\nAny single anomaly or series of anomalies, or other operational failure or degradation, on any of the satellites, or the complete loss of a satellite, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and revenue and our relationships with current customers and distributors, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Anomalies may also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby creating additional expense due to the need to provide replacement or backup capacity and potentially reducing revenue\nif service is interrupted or degraded on the satellites utilized. We may not be able to obtain backup capacity or a replacement satellite on reasonable economic terms, a reasonable schedule or at all.\nMany satellites have redundant or backup systems and components that operate in the event of an anomaly, operational failure or degradation of primary critical components, but these redundant or backup systems and components are subject to risk of failure similar to those experienced by the primary systems and components. The occurrence of a failure of any of these redundant or backup systems and components could materially impair the useful life, capacity or operational capabilities of the satellite.\nWe may experience losses from fixed-price Connectivity contracts or contracts where our average revenue per customer declines more quickly relative to decreasing (or potentially increasing) associated costs.\nIn our Connectivity segment, we typically charge customers (including our largest Aviation Connectivity customer) a fixed-rate monthly recurring fee for services under several of our long-term contracts, which are usually three to nine years in length. These contracts carry the risk of potential cost overruns because we assume the burden of all costs under the agreement.\nWe assume greater financial risk on fixed-price contracts than on other types of contracts because our ability to profit on such contracts is dependent on our ability to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately and control costs during the performance of such contracts. If we are unable to estimate or control costs under our fixed price contracts, the net profit of our Connectivity segment may be significantly reduced. Because many of these long-term contracts involve new technologies and applications, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of materials, problems with the suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. We may experience cost overruns and operating losses on at least some of our customer agreements\nThe long sales cycle of many of our Connectivity segment\u2019s products increases the difficulty of our expense planning and revenue forecasting and may cause us to expend substantial resources without any assurance of an acceptable financial return.\nMany of our Connectivity segment\u2019s products have long sales cycles that involve numerous steps, including initial customer contacts, specification writing, software engineering design, software prototyping, pilot testing, device certification, regulatory approvals, marketing and sales efforts and commercial manufacture, integration and delivery. During this cycle, we may expend substantial financial resources and management time and effort without any assurance or ability to predict when or if product sales will result. Delays in sales may cause us to expend significant resources without any assurance of an acceptable financial return and increases the difficulty of our expense planning and revenue forecasting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may experience losses from satellite capacity contracts that require us to make minimum payments, which we may not be able to satisfy.\nWe currently have, and may enter into, multi-year contracts with satellite-capacity suppliers where we have agreed to make minimum payments over the life of those contracts. If we lose current customers and then do not obtain an adequate number of new customers, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to exceed the costs associated with these satellite-capacity agreements. Our commitment to our satellite-capacity suppliers may cause us to suffer significant losses in these circumstances, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. This expenditure of cash could limit our ability to make other investments in technology and in other businesses that our management may wish to pursue. Our minimum commitment under our satellite-capacity contracts may have a negative impact on our liquidity position, and we may have insufficient cash to fund our operations as a result.\nRisks Related to Our Media & Content Segment\nWe face competition from the increasing on-board use of personal electronic devices and greater capabilities for passengers to access and download content to such devices prior to travel, which may, among other things, cause airlines to reduce investment in seatback entertainment systems in the future.\nEver-increasing numbers of passengers have personal electronic devices and may subscribe or have access to \u201cover-the-top\u201d download services (such as Amazon and Netflix) that permit them to download content onto their personal electronic devices prior to travel. If passengers no longer utilize traditional IFE systems for the delivery of content, and the demand for our services subsequently declines, our customers may cease engaging with us for their content service provider needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Media & Content segment and the related media and content market faces pricing pressure from both customers and studios, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur Media & Content business faces pricing pressures from both our customers and studios. Studios, distributors and other content providers seek more expensive pricing for the content that we acquire, and our customers simultaneously demand and negotiate for lower prices and rates for the content and services that we provide. The potential for content non-renewal from major studios and the current trend in the consolidation of various production companies may result in higher content costs for 2020 and beyond. Changes to our cost structure and pricing that reduce our overall yields may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere could be a reduction in the use of intermediary content service providers.\nOur customers may reduce their use of intermediary content service providers (such as us) and seek to obtain content directly from content creators and distributors (i.e., directly from our content suppliers). If our customers execute engagements directly with studios, distributors and other content creators, then our business as a content service provider may be adversely affected.\nOur revenue may be adversely affected by a reduction or elimination of the time between our receipt of content and the content being made more broadly publicly available to the rental or home viewing market (i.e., the \u201cearly release window\u201d).\nWe receive the content that we provide directly from studios, distributors and other content providers, and the timing of our receipt of such content is at the discretion of such content providers. Historically, we have received content prior to its availability to the public through the rental or retail markets or Internet streaming services and we have taken advantage of this \u201cearly release window\u201d in our business by offering our enterprise customers media and content options before they become generally available to their customers. However, if content providers delay the release of content in a manner that reduces or eliminates the \u201cearly release window,\u201d we may be unable to generate anticipated revenue in our Media & Content segment because customers may have the opportunity to consume or download such content at home rather than in-flight. Furthermore, the rapid spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on the release schedule and availability of media and content. This may reduce the volume and quality of content available on an \u201cearly release window\u201d during the next year.\nOur music content licenses could result in operational complexity that may divert resources or make our business more expensive to conduct.\nThe large number of licenses we maintain for purposes of operating our Media & Content services, including our music offerings, could create operational complexities in connection with tracking the rights we have acquired and the complex structures under which we have royalty and reporting obligations. If we are unable to accurately track amounts that we must pay to the numerous parties with whom we have licenses in connection with each delivery of media content or if we do not deliver the appropriate payment in a timely fashion, we may risk financial penalties and/or termination of licenses. For instance, in connection with some of our music licenses, we are responsible for reporting usage by our customers and remitting royalties to the music licensors. To do so, we must depend on timely and accurate reporting by our customers of the information necessary to make royalty payments to applicable music licensors. Additionally, the effort to obtain necessary rights from third parties is often significant, and in some cases such challenges could lead to disruption or delay in executing our business plans. In addition, in the context of our music offerings, if we are unable to determine which musical works correspond to specific sound recordings for purposes of obtaining necessary licenses, it could lead to a reduction in the music we are able to make available to our customers, reduced cash flow, litigation and other negative actions.\nWe may experience losses from fixed-price Media & Content contracts if the market price for that service declines relative to our committed cost.\nWe currently have fixed-price licensing contracts with some of the studios from which we purchase content which enable us to purchase content during their respective terms at fixed purchase prices, or through \u201cflat deals.\u201d Adjustments to such fixed purchase prices may be advisable or necessary, such as if there are significant changes in customer demand or content supply. If we are unable to make such adjustments or if there is a shift in the customer base under such contracts, then there is a risk that the profit margins on such fixed-price Media & Content contracts may be smaller than predicted or result in a loss, reduced cash flow, litigation and other negative actions. In addition, we may fail to utilize fixed-price contracts in our content supply chain (as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting) and such failure may also cause us to realize smaller margins than we originally forecasted. Reduced profit margins or losses in our Media & Content segment resulting from fixed-price contracts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Related to maintaining our Enterprise Resource Planning system\nWe may not succeed in improving and streamline operating systems, including migrating to a single and effective Enterprise Resources Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system across all of our businesses to assist with remediating our material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe have numerous material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result of our failure to have an effective system of operations, including a robust ERP system. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Our ability to remediate our material weaknesses in our internal controls depends in part on our ability to implement and maintain an effective operating system and ERP system and adequately train our personnel to effectively utilize the system. We currently utilize several ERP systems, some of which have been only partially integrated from our acquired businesses. We intend to continue to streamline these disparate systems into a single Oracle ERP system which will require significant time and resources especially as it relates to fully integrating certain of our foreign entities. However, we can make no assurance that our efforts to maintain the ERP system and further implementation efforts will be successful or that such system will meet our expectations in respect of our efforts to remediate certain of our material weaknesses.\nRisk Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure or inability to sufficiently protect them could harm our business and operating results.\nOur proprietary rights to the technologies we use in our products and services, are important to our ability to continue the operations of our business. We generally rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and contractual rights to protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and endeavor to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could use the intellectual property we have developed to enhance their own products and services, which could materially harm our business. Monitoring and preventing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. In addition, we may be required to commence litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If we are unsuccessful in any such litigation in the future or elect not to pursue litigation for business or reputational reasons, our rights to enforce or use such intellectual property may be impaired or we could lose some or all of our rights to such intellectual property. We do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, including in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as extensively as in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time and effort required to create innovative products.\nRisks related to Information Technology and Data Security\nWe rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident, other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems. These technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, espionage, cyber-attacks, viruses, theft and inadvertent release of information. Any such disruption to these software and other technology systems, or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated, or the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, and competitive disadvantage, any or all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits. Moreover, a cybersecurity breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect personal information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in a disruption of our operations.\nFurthermore, as we pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.\nWhile the Company has invested, and continues to invest, in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, as well as disaster recovery plans, these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations. Additionally, information technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner. If our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do, such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we do business. For example, the EU adopted a new regulation that became effective in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Similarly, the State of California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020, which grants certain rights to California residents with respect to their personal information. Our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of GDPR, the CCPA and other laws and regulations in this area could result in substantial fines or penalties and legal liability and could tarnish our reputation.\nWe are subject to civil litigation involving allegations of copyright and patent infringement and related claims for indemnification, which could result in our having to pay damages. We may also be subject to additional similar litigation in the future.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to civil litigation by parties claiming that certain of our audio and music programming offerings infringe the copyright and other intellectual property rights of such parties. For example, previously we entered into settlements with music-rights holders, which resulted in large cash and stock payments by us to resolve the litigation. See our discussion of our \u201cSound Recording Settlements\u201d in Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. Music and related content are subject to complex licensing and intellectual property rights regimes, and if we are unable to successfully navigate those regimes, we may incur damages and liability for any rights infringement. In addition, we are, and in the future may be, subject to civil litigation by patent owners that claim that our connectivity systems infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights.\nWe may continue to incur costs to defend and/or settle such lawsuits and such costs may be material. We may be required to pay substantial damages and/or be subject to injunctive relief as a result of these matters, and until resolved, these matters may divert the attention of our management and other resources. The outcome of the foregoing matters is inherently uncertain and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Some of our suppliers may not provide us with an indemnity for the use of the products and services that these providers supply to us, even if we are exposed to liability for their infringement. At the same time, we generally offer third-party intellectual property infringement indemnity to the customers of our Connectivity segment which, in some cases, do not cap our indemnity obligations and thus could render us liable for both defense costs and any judgments. Any of these events could result in increases in our operating expenses, limit our service offerings or result in a loss of business if we are unable to meet our indemnification obligations and our airline customers terminate or fail to renew their contracts.\nRisks Related to Legal, Governmental and Regulatory Matters.\nWe may face changes in regulations and difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals to provide our services or to operate our business in particular countries or territorial waters, which could have a material adverse impact on the competitive position, growth and financial performance of our Connectivity segment.\nIn a number of countries where we operate our Connectivity segment, the provision of our services is highly regulated. We may be required to obtain approvals from national and local authorities in connection with most of the telecommunication services that we provide. In many jurisdictions, we must maintain such approvals through compliance with license conditions or payment of annual regulatory fees. For example, some of our Connectivity customers to whom we provide maritime and land products and services utilize our services on mobile vessels or drilling platforms that may enter into new countries on short notice. If we do not\nalready have a license to provide our service in that country or to operate in that country\u2019s territorial waters, if required, we may be required to obtain a license, permit or other regulatory approval on short notice, which may not be feasible in some countries. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could subject us to various sanctions including fines, penalties, arrests or criminal charges, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations or cause us to delay or terminate our service to such vessel or platform until such license or regulatory approval may be obtained. In some areas of international waters, it is ambiguous as to which country\u2019s regulations apply, if any, and thus difficult and costly for us to determine which licenses or other regulatory approvals we should obtain. In such areas, we could be subject to various penalties or sanctions if we fail to comply with the applicable country\u2019s regulations.\nWe are unable to predict with any certainty the arrival of new or changed regulations from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the products and services we provide in our Connectivity segment, including the operation of satellites, the use and type of satellite bandwidth, the use of radio spectrum, the licensing of earth stations and other radio transmitters, the provision of communications services, the design, manufacture and marketing of communications systems and networking infrastructure and maritime activity. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of financial penalties against us, the adverse modification or cancellation of required authorizations, or other material adverse actions.\nLaws and regulations affecting our Company and the Connectivity segment are subject to change in response to industry developments, new technology, and political considerations. Legislators and regulatory authorities in various countries are considering, and may adopt, new laws, policies and regulations, as well as changes to existing regulations, regarding a variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our operations or the operations of our distribution partners, increase the cost of providing products and services and make the products and services of our Connectivity segment less competitive in our core markets, including by making it easier or less expensive for competitors to compete with us. In addition, regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d), may impair our ability to raise funds from foreign sources.\nRegulation by U.S. government agencies, such as the FAA (which regulates design, production, operations and maintenance under the United States\u2019 international regulatory jurisdiction), the FCC (which regulates the U.S. telecommunications industry), the FTC (which regulates competition and consumer protection) and their foreign equivalents may increase our costs of providing services, may require us to change our services, or, if we are not in compliance with relevant requirements, may lead to costly regulatory enforcement actions against us that can result in the imposition of significant penalties.\nOur Connectivity segment is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and foreign government agencies. The U.S. government agency that has primary regulatory authority over our operations is the FAA. Similar government agencies in foreign countries also exercise regulatory oversight over our business operations. The commercial and private aviation industries, including civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries, are highly regulated by the FAA and FAA-like organizations. FAA certification is (and similar certification in foreign countries may be) required for all equipment that we install on commercial aircraft, and certain of our operating activities require that we obtain FAA certification or similar foreign certifications as a parts manufacturer. For example, in the United States, FAA approvals required to operate our Connectivity segment include STCs and Parts Manufacturer Approvals (\u201cPMAs\u201d). Obtaining STCs and PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant expenditures of time and resources. Any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed FAA certifications or their foreign equivalents, authorizations or approvals could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet the installation commitments of our Connectivity segment, to manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or to expand our business and could, therefore, materially adversely affect our growth prospects, business and operating results. If we fail to comply with the many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose our FAA certifications or their foreign equivalents, authorizations or other approvals on which the manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities of our Connectivity segment rely. In addition, the FAA and other similar government agencies may adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. These government agencies could also change their policies regarding the delegation of compliance determinations to private companies (as opposed to government agencies) (which private companies we currently engage for these services), which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, they would generally increase our costs of compliance.\nWe are also subject to the rules and regulations of the FCC and similar rules and regulations in foreign countries. For example, as part of our authorization to provide satellite-based Wi-Fi services in our Connectivity segment, we have licenses from the FCC that obligate us to comply with various technical, operational and service requirements specifically identified in such licenses as well as other rules and regulations promulgated by the FCC. Our Connectivity business could in the future become subject to the laws and regulations in the United States applicable to mass-market retail providers of broadband Internet access services, and pursuant to an agreement with U.S. federal law enforcement agencies, our aviation connectivity operations must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (\u201cCALEA\u201d), under which communications carriers and some other service providers must ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate technical capabilities in executing\nauthorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Many non-U.S. countries have similar lawful-intercept requirements. Other portions of our Connectivity business may also be subject to CALEA. We could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC and other U.S. and foreign telecommunications regulators or law enforcement agencies for our failure to satisfy any of these laws, regulations and commitments, or these laws and regulations may change in a manner adverse to us. This could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, loss of licenses and other penalties, as well as increased compliance burdens and costs, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign consumer protection requirements, including data privacy and security requirements and restrictions on international personal-data transfers. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) Act prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that: collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the company\u2019s actual practices; and/or fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information.\nAdverse decisions or regulations of any of the foregoing U.S. and foreign regulators could negatively impact our operations, increase our costs of doing business and potentially expose us to significant liability. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of legal, regulatory and policy changes that could be adopted by those entities.\nOur aviation customers are regulated by civil aviation authorities. In the United States, these authorities and agencies include the FAA, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). If such authorities or their global equivalents issue orders, airworthiness directives or other regulations that restrict our customers\u2019 ability to operate the aircraft on which we provide service, our service revenue could be negatively affected.\nWe serve global airlines that are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and foreign civil aviation authorities. These authorities exercise regulatory oversight over the maintenance and operation of aircraft, including airworthiness matters. From time to time, these authorities issue orders, airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that could require, among other things, operational restrictions by our customers or the grounding of an entire aircraft type if these authorities identify design, manufacturing, maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action. For instance, starting in March 2019, the FAA and other regulators grounded the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. A prolonged or permanent grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft has affected and may continue to affect our customers, particularly Southwest Airlines, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, operating results and financial conditions. If these orders, directives or other regulations restrict the ability of our customers to operate the aircraft on which we provide service, our revenue could be negatively affected.\nRegulation by foreign government agencies may increase our costs of providing services or require us to change our services.\nOur Connectivity segment is subject to regulation by regulatory agencies and legislative bodies outside the United States where we do, or in the future may do, business. These foreign bodies may require us to obtain certifications for equipment that we install and certain of our operating activities may require that we obtain foreign regulatory certifications as a parts manufacturer. Obtaining these certifications could be an expensive and time-consuming process requiring significant focus and resources. Adverse decisions or regulations of these foreign government agencies could delay the roll-out of our services and have other adverse consequences for us.\nAny inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet the installation commitments of our Connectivity segment, manufacture and sell parts for installation, or expand our business and could, therefore, materially adversely affect our growth prospects, business and operating results. If we fail to comply with the many foreign regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the foreign certifications, authorizations or other approvals on which the manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities of our Connectivity segment are based. In addition, from time to time, the foreign bodies that regulate our activities may adopt new regulations, amend existing regulations or change their policies, all of which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, those new regulations or amendments to existing regulations would generally increase our costs of compliance.\nChanges in government regulation of the Internet, including e-commerce or online video distribution, may cause us to change our Connectivity operations and incur greater operating costs in order to maintain compliance.\nThe current legal environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain and subject to statutory, regulatory or interpretive change. Certain laws and regulations applicable to our Connectivity segment often do not contemplate\nor address specific issues associated with those technologies, and regulators may disagree with our interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the applicability of existing laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways. We cannot be certain what positions regulators may take regarding our compliance with, or lack of compliance with, current and future legal and regulatory requirements or what positions regulators may take regarding any past or future actions that our Connectivity segment has taken or may take in any jurisdiction. Regulators may determine that we are not in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and impose penalties, or we may need to make changes to our connectivity system, which could be costly and difficult or could result in lower revenues. Our failure, or the failure of our vendors and media partners, customers and others with whom we transact business, to comply with legal or regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe international sales and operations of our business are subject to extensive regulatory and compliance requirements including trade, export, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption practices and data protection laws.\nWe are required to comply with numerous and constantly changing laws and regulations in jurisdictions around the world. If our compliance efforts prove insufficient or any of our employees fail to comply with, or intentionally disregard, any of our policies or applicable laws or regulations, a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the Company, including, but not limited to, significant penalties and fines, sanctions or litigation, and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing, any of which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAdditionally, we must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to it include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) as well as various anti-bribery, anti-corruption and data privacy laws. The export of certain of our satellite hardware, services and technical data relating to satellites may in the future be regulated by the U.S. Department of State under ITAR. Other products and services we provide are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the EAR. We also cannot provide services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally bars bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. A substantial portion of our business is with airlines and non-governmental organizations, which constitute \u201cgovernment officials\u201d for many anti-bribery laws in many jurisdictions, which could increase the risk of potential anti-corruption compliance issues. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions including fines, onerous compliance requirements, extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. We are also subject to the United Kingdom\u2019s Corporate Criminal Offence of the Failure to Prevent the Facilitation of Tax Evasion based on our large U.K. footprint. A violation of any of the regulations described above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our operations to include a physical international presence, or otherwise expand our collection of personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. In May 2018, the European Union\u2019s GDPR took effect, which resulted in even more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. Penalties for non-compliance with the GDPR are considerable, allowing E.U. regulators to impose a monetary penalty of up to 4% of an entity\u2019s annual global turnover or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater. Similarly, the State of California legislature passed the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, which grants certain rights to California residents with respect to their personal information. We may fail to comply with any of these requirements, and compliance with these requirements may increase our compliance burden and costs. In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries.\nCertain mechanisms apply under European Union member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. We have entered into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union to legitimize these transfers. There is a risk that these standard contractual clauses may be invalidated by the Court of Justice for the European Union as a lawful data transfer mechanism on the grounds that they do not provide adequate protection of European data subjects\u2019 personally identifiable information. There is also a risk that E.U. data protection authorities may investigate or bring enforcement actions with criminal and administrative sanctions. Such actions could also damage our business and harm our reputation.\nWe have been subject to civil stockholder litigation involving allegations that certain of our investor disclosures were false or misleading. We may be subject to additional similar litigation in the future.\nWe and certain of our former officers and directors were named as defendants in certain purported stockholder class action lawsuits. Specifically, on February 23, 2017 and on March 17, 2017, following the Company\u2019s announcement that it anticipated\na delay in its 2016 Form 10-K filing and that its former CEO Dave Davis and former CFO Tom Severson would separate from the Company, three putative securities class action lawsuits were filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California. These lawsuits alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act against the Company, Mr. Davis, Mr. Severson and Michael Zemetra (who was our CFO prior to Mr. Severson). The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed two of these lawsuits. The third lawsuit, brought by putative stockholder M&M Hart Living Trust and Randi Williams (the \u201cHart complaint\u201d), alleged that the Company and the other defendants made misrepresentations and/or omitted material information about the EMC Acquisition, the Company\u2019s projected financial performance and synergies following that acquisition, and the impact of that acquisition on the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. Plaintiffs sought unspecified damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On November 30, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the Court\u2019s previous judgment of dismissal to permit them to file a further amended complaint. On January 8, 2018 the Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to alter or amend the previous judgment. On January 29, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the Court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment. In October 2018, the parties agreed to a $1.1 million settlement, which was fully covered by our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance (\u201cD&O insurance\u201d) provider. On January 28, 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion for final approval of the settlement. On March 5, 2019, the Court issued its final approval of the settlement and dismissed the Hart complaint with prejudice.\nWe incurred costs to defend and settle such lawsuits and may incur additional costs to defend and/or settle similar matters. In addition, we may be required to pay substantial damages in connection with such matters if we do not ultimately prevail. Further, such lawsuits divert the attention of our management and consume other resources. Our D&O insurance may not be adequate to cover our obligations to indemnify our directors and officers, fund a settlement of such lawsuits or pay an adverse judgment. We also may not be able to renew our D&O insurance on favorable terms or comparable coverage limits due to our past stockholder lawsuits and adverse D&O market conditions.\nIn addition to the lawsuit described above, we and our current and/or former officers and directors may face additional suits from stockholders in the future. Any such suits may similarly cause us to incur substantial costs, result in management distraction, and expose us to significant damages. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any such litigation, and any adverse outcome of such cases could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nOur potential indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance could result in significant legal expenses or damages and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations\nBoth current and former officers and members of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), as individual defendants, could be the subject of lawsuits related to the Company. Under Delaware law, our by-laws and certain indemnification agreements, we may have an obligation to indemnify both current and former officers and directors in relation to these matters. If the Company incurs significant uninsured indemnity obligations, our indemnity obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nHistorically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of significant fluctuations in our revenue, earnings and margins over the past few years, and variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts. For example, the closing price per share of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market ranged from a low of $10.00 to a high of $67.75 for the year ended December 31, 2019. If our future operating results or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors, our stock price will likely decline.\nIf we fail to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s requirements for continued listing, including the minimum closing bid price and market value of listed securities requirements, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common stock. A delisting would give rise to a repurchase obligation under the indenture for our convertible notes and could have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOn November 6, 2019, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications staff (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of Nasdaq that, based upon our non-compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market required to maintain continued listing under the Nasdaq listing rules (the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d), our common stock would be subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless we timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d). In accordance with Nasdaq\u2019s procedures, we timely appealed Nasdaq\u2019s determination by requesting a hearing before the Panel to seek continued listing of our common stock. The hearing was held on December 5, 2019.\nOn December 16, 2019, the Panel granted the Company\u2019s request for continued listing of the Company\u2019s common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to an initial extension through April 15, 2020 or, in certain circumstances, through May 4, 2020. On March 17, 2020, we received notification that the Panel granted a further extension through May 4, 2020 in which to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule in light of the extreme volatility in financial markets resulting from COVID-19.\nOn April 13, 2020, we received another letter from the Staff notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the \u201cMVLS Rule\u201d) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, because the market value of our listed securities was less than $35 million for the previous 30 consecutive business days.\nOn April 15, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of our outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-25 (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d), which was intended to enable us to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock was decreased from 92,944,935 to 3,717,797, all with a par value of $0.0001. The effective date of the Reverse Stock Split was April 16, 2020.\nOn April 30, 2020, we were notified that we had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule; however, we remain non-compliant with the MVLS Rule. Under the Nasdaq listing rules, we have until October 12, 2020 to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule by demonstrating that the market value of our listed securities is $35 million or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance with the MVLS Rule by the required date, we may appeal for an extension to regain compliance with no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the extension. If we do not regain compliance by October 12, 2020 or by the extended compliance date, if applicable, Nasdaq would delist our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on Nasdaq, this would constitute a \u201cfundamental change\u201d, as defined in the indenture governing our convertible notes, pursuant to which the holders of convertible notes would have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of our convertible notes to be repurchased. We may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain financing if we are required to repurchase the convertible notes, which could cause us to default under the indenture. A default under the indenture would also cause an event of default under our 2017 Credit Agreement, which, at the election of the requisite majority of lenders, could cause all outstanding indebtedness under our 2017 Credit Agreement to become immediately due and payable. An acceleration under the indenture would also cause an event of default under our Second Lien Notes, which, at the election of the requisite majority of holders, could cause all outstanding indebtedness under our Second Lien Notes to become immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, a delisting and/or trading suspension of our securities from Nasdaq would negatively impact us because it could, among other things: (i) reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limit our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets; (iv) impair our ability to provide liquid equity incentives to our employees; and (v) have negative reputational impact for us with our customers, suppliers, employees and other persons with whom we transact from time to time.\nThe interests of our largest security holders may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders.\nBased on the information available to us, Nantahala Capital Management, LLC (\u201cNantahala\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 31.0% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019, and was our largest stockholder on that date; entities affiliated with ABRY Partners beneficially owned approximately 10.2% of our outstanding common stock as of that date; and affiliates of Searchlight owned approximately 7.5% of our outstanding common stock as of that date. In addition, affiliates of Searchlight hold all of our outstanding Second Lien Notes and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,242,631 shares of our common stock as described above under the risk factor entitled \u201cExercise or conversion of our Searchlight warrants and/or convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\u201d As such, our securities are highly concentrated within a limited group of large securityholders. Furthermore, in connection with Searchlight\u2019s purchase of our warrants, we agreed to allow Searchlight to nominate two directors to our Board. Searchlight will continue to have the right to nominate one or two members of our Board (according to a formula based on the number of warrants and/or shares that it holds) so long as it holds at least 25% of the Penny Warrants that it originally acquired (and/or the shares issued upon exercise of such warrants).\nBecause of this concentration of ownership and the presence of Searchlight\u2019s nominees on our Board, our largest securityholders may have significant influence over us. These securityholders may have the ability to influence the nomination and election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions of the Company requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate and financing transactions. This concentration of ownership, as well as Searchlight\u2019s right to demand repayment of our Second Lien Notes upon a change of control, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change\nin control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of these securityholders may conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may decline as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur stock price has declined significantly over the last 24 months and continues to experience volatility. Any of the factors listed below could have a further adverse effect on an investment in our securities, and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price that you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline. Factors that may affect the trading price of our securities in the future may include:\n\u2022\nthe convergence of COVID-19 fears and oil-price uncertainties that may drive downward market activity.\n\u2022\nour material weaknesses in our internal controls;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to consummate beneficial investment and M&A transactions, including due to our inability to obtain any required regulatory or national security approvals;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company, the market for in-flight entertainment, the airline industry, or the travel market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of domestic and international protests, disputes, or other geopolitical events that affect our business or our industry;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in our Board or management; and\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities and credit-ratings analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If insufficient securities or industry analysts cover us, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts covering us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur charter and by-laws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified Board with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that an annual meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chair of the Board, the chief executive officer, or the Board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding the Board with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings of stockholders and to cancel previously scheduled annual meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our management. In addition, given concentrated holdings at our largest shareholders, any takeover or change in control may be difficult without their support.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOn March 19, 2020, our Board adopted a stockholder rights plan, as set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d), and issued the rights contemplated thereby (the \u201cRights\u201d) on March 30, 2020. The Rights Plan is intended to promote the fair and equal treatment of all of our stockholders and ensure that no person or group can gain control of us through open market accumulation or other tactics without paying a control premium and potentially disadvantaging the interest of all stockholders. The Rights Plan ensures that our Board has sufficient time to exercise its fiduciary duties to make informed judgments about the actions of third parties that may not be in the best interests of us and our stockholders.\nIn general terms, the Rights will become exercisable if a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding Common Stock. Stockholders who beneficially owned 20% or more of Global Eagle\u2019s outstanding common stock prior to the issuance of this press release will not trigger the exercisability of the Rights so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares of common stock at a time when they still beneficially own 20% or more of such common stock, subject to certain exceptions as described in the Rights Plan. In the event that the Rights become exercisable due to the triggering ownership threshold being crossed, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock or equivalent securities having a market value at that time of twice the Right\u2019s purchase price. The Rights Agreement is attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 4.14.\nWe may issue additional equity or convertible debt securities in the future, which may result in additional dilution to investors.\nTo the extent that we need to raise additional capital in the future and we issue additional shares of common stock, warrants or other securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock, our then existing stockholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock. The issuance of such additional common stock, warrants, or other convertible or exchangeable securities could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock, which could adversely affect investors\u2019 ability to sell shares in the market or our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all, in the future or both. Our charter authorizes our Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights or voting rights. If we issue preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we may experience delays in filing our periodic SEC reports and resulting in being ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nDelayed filing of some of our periodic reports with the SEC, will result in not being eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and assuming we continue to remain timely in our SEC reporting. Should\nwe wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public when we are ineligible to use Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase as a result of having to use Form S-1, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction quickly and successfully, and as a result potentially harming our financial condition.\nWe could incur additional losses due to further impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of numerous acquisitions. At December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our goodwill was $159.6 million. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the various acquisition dates. We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and do so during the fourth quarter of each year, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our reporting units below its book value. Such factors requiring an interim test for goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, financial performance indicators such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings and a sustained decrease in share price. Our cash flow estimates involve projections that are inherently subject to change based on future events. A significant downward revision in the fair value of one or more of our business units that causes the carrying value to exceed the fair value could cause goodwill to be considered impaired, and could result in a non-cash impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges in the past. The forecasts utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis as part of our impairment test assume future revenue and profitability growth in each of our reporting units during the next four years and beyond. If our operating units cannot obtain, or we determine at a later date that we no longer expect them to obtain the projected levels of profitability, future goodwill impairment tests may also result in an impairment charge. There can be no assurances that our operating divisions will be able to achieve our estimated levels of profitability. We cannot be certain that goodwill impairment will not be required during future periods.\nA goodwill impairment, although non-cash, could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations. We are assessing goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis as a result of a significant decline in our market capitalization subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2019, which we believe is driven by investor uncertainty around our liquidity position, and lower than expected projected financial results in our Media & Content, Aviation Connectivity, Maritime & Land Connectivity reporting units stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, management has determined that an impairment triggering event occurred in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020. Given these indicators, we have determined there is a higher degree of risk in achieving our financial projections for each reporting unit and as such, decreased projected operating performance and increased the discount rate, which will reduce the fair value of each reporting unit when compared to their respective carrying values. As a result, each of our reporting units is at risk of impairment in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations or financial results is uncertain as we are unable to accurately predict the severity and the duration of the pandemic. As a result of these changing factors and uncertainties, management continues to evaluate its estimates that have a material adverse impact on the results of operations.\nAs of the filing of Form 10-K on May 14, 2020, a significant goodwill impairment in the first quarter of 2020 is possible. However, we are unable to estimate the magnitude of a potential impairment in our reporting units and potential long-lived asset impairments.", "PERMNO": 12792, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GEENQ"}
