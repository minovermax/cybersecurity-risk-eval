{"cik": "1108236", "company": "AMERICAN RIVER BANKSHARES", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company and its subsidiary, American River Bank, conduct business in an environment that includes certain risks described below any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, future prospects and stock price. You are also referred to the matters described under the heading \u201cCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d in Part I, Item 1 and Part II, Item 7 of this report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding factors that may affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\u00b7 Deterioration of economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and in Northern California, in particular. If the U.S. or California economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained or impeded. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is always a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including uncertainty over the stability of the euro currency, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder U.S. economic growth and affect our business and the businesses of our customers.\nThe Company\u2019s operating market has begun to show demand for credit products as the continued low rate environment and expectations for economic expansion have increased refinancing as well as new loan activity. However, deterioration in economic conditions locally, regionally or nationally could result in an economic downturn in Northern California with the following consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business:\n\u00a7 loan delinquencies and defaults may increase;\n\u00a7 problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u00a7 demand for loans and other products and services may decline;\n\u00a7 low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease;\n\u00a7 collateral for loans may decline in value, in turn reducing clients\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral as sources of repayment of existing loans;\n\u00a7 foreclosed assets may not be able to be sold;\n\u00a7 volatile securities market conditions could adversely affect valuations of investment portfolio assets; and\n\u00a7 reputational risk may increase due to public sentiment regarding the banking industry.\n\u00b7 Nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had no nonperforming loans and leases. At December 31, 2019, our nonperforming assets (which include foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets) to total assets had decreased to 0.19%. While these nonperforming loans and leases and nonperforming assets have decreased since 2008, there is no guarantee that these levels will continue into the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nNonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile, which could result in a request to reduce our level of nonperforming assets and/or raise additional capital. When we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. We may experience increases in nonperforming assets and the disposition of such nonperforming assets may adversely affect our profitability.\n\u00b7 Tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA tightening of the credit markets or any inability to obtain adequate funds for asset growth at an acceptable cost could adversely affect our asset growth and liquidity position and, therefore, our earnings capability. In addition to core deposit growth, maturity of investment securities and loan and lease payments, we also rely on alternative funding sources including unsecured borrowing lines with correspondent banks, secured borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and public time certificates of deposits. Our ability to access these sources could be impaired by deterioration in our financial condition as well as factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations for the financial services industry or serious dislocation in the general credit markets. In the event such a disruption should occur, our ability to access these sources could be adversely affected, both as to price and availability, which would limit or potentially raise the cost of the funds available to us.\n\u00b7 We have a concentration risk in real estate related loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, $323.8 million, or 81.0% of our total loan and lease portfolio, consisted of real estate related loans. Of that amount, $214.6 million, or 66.3%, consisted of commercial real estate, $23.2 million, or 7.2% consisted of commercial and residential construction loans (including land acquisition and development loans) and $86.0 million, or 26.5%, consisted of residential mortgages and residential multi-family real estate. The majority of our real property collateral is located in our operating markets in Northern California. If there is a substantial decline in commercial and residential real estate values in our primary operating markets as a result of any deterioration in economic conditions or other events including natural disasters such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, fires, and similar adverse weather occurrences. Such a decline in values could have an adverse impact on us by limiting repayment of defaulted loans through sale of commercial and residential real estate collateral and by a likely increase in the number of defaulted loans to the extent that the financial condition of our borrowers is adversely affected by such a decline in values.\n\u00b7 We may take title to real estate that exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nOur loan and lease portfolio may include loans secured by real estate which could be subject to environmental liabilities. In the event that we foreclose upon and take title to such real estate, we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\u00b7 Our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, the Bank maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance, but its allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses. In addition, future provisions for loan and lease losses could materially and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s and therefore our Company\u2019s operating results. The adequacy of the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of realizable future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in the local and general California real estate market and operating environment, as well as interest rates, employment levels and other economic factors that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates.\nFederal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, review the Bank\u2019s loans and leases and allowance for loan and lease losses, as well as management\u2019s policies and procedures for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that our allowance for loan and lease losses policies are effective and that our allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to cover current probable incurred losses. However, the Bank may have to further increase the allowance for loan and lease losses as a result of the effects of deterioration of economic conditions nationally and in the operating markets in which the Bank conducts business and/or as a result of changes in regulation or accounting methodologies.\n\u00b7 Our focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our largest outstanding commercial business loan and largest outstanding commercial real estate loan amounted to $4.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively. At such date, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $214.6 million, or 53.8% of our total loan and lease portfolio, and our commercial business loans amounted to $43.0 million, or 10.8% of our total loan and lease portfolio. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally are considered riskier than single-family residential loans because they have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans involve risks because the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans typically depends primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans. Most of the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate and commercial business loans are made to small business or middle market customers who may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u00b7 Our business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce our net interest income. It is expected that we will continue to realize income from the differential or \u201cmargin\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margins are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations. We may be unable to minimize our interest rate risk. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest margin, asset quality, and loan origination volume.\n\u00b7 We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expanded the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters, such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. Although the applicability of certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act is limited to institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, there can be no guarantee that such applicability will not be extended in the future or that regulators or other third parties will not seek to impose such requirements on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Company. Compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations has and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Failure to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and any other federal, state and local governmental regulation could also result in financial penalties and regulatory enforcement actions which could limit or restrict our ability to conduct our operations, require us to raise capital, increase our compliance costs and expose us to reputational risk.\nIn addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress and in California that could further substantially increase regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices. Federal regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 Governmental fiscal and monetary policies may affect our business and are beyond our control.\nThe business of banking is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Such policies are beyond our control. We are particularly affected by the policies established by the Federal Reserve Board in relation to the supply of money and credit in the United States. The instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve Board can be used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, and this can and does have a material adverse effect on our business. Any deterioration of economic conditions could result in further intervention and legislation beyond our control. Such deterioration could also limit our access to capital or sources of liquidity in amounts and at times necessary to conduct operations in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\u00b7 The Bank faces strong competition from banks, financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could adversely affect our business.\nIncreased competition in our market areas may result in reduced loans and deposits or the rates charged or paid on these instruments and adversely affect our net interest margin. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer similar banking services compared to those that are offered by the Bank. These competitors include national and super-regional banks, finance companies, investment banking and brokerage firms, credit unions, government-assisted farm credit programs, other community banks and technology-oriented financial institutions offering online services. In particular, the Bank\u2019s competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits than we do and are thereby better able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loans and deposits, as well as the range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances, such as Internet-based banking services that cross traditional geographic bounds, enable more companies to provide financial services. If the Bank is unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to maintain our historical levels of loans and leases and deposits or our net interest margin, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\u00b7 Our operations are dependent upon key personnel.\nOur future prospects are and will remain highly dependent on our directors, executive officers and other key personnel. From time to time, we have experienced changes in the membership of our board of directors and changes among the personnel serving as our executive officers. Our success will, to some extent, depend on the continued service of our directors and executive officers, in addition to our ability to continue to attract and retain experienced banking professionals to serve us and the Bank as directors, executive officers and in other key positions. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business and future operations.\n\u00b7 Technology implementation problems or computer system failures could adversely affect us.\nOur future growth prospects will be highly dependent on the ability of the Bank to implement changes in technology that affect the delivery of banking services such as the increased demand for computer access to bank accounts and the availability to perform banking transactions electronically. The Bank\u2019s ability to compete will depend upon its ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet such demands. In addition, our business and operations and those of the Bank could be susceptible to adverse effects from computer failures, communication and energy disruption, and activities such as fraud of unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruptions or failures of the Bank\u2019s data processing system.\n\u00b7 Cybersecurity or datasecurity breaches and failures or other technological difficulties could adversely affect us.\nWe cannot be certain that the continued implementation of safeguards will eliminate the risk of vulnerability to technological difficulties or failures or ensure the absence of a breach of information security, including as a result of cybersecurity breach. The FDIC cited cybersecurity as a critical challenge facing the financial services industry and stated that the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks are increasing. If our information security is compromised or other technology difficulties or failures occur at the Bank or with one of our vendors, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Bank could be exposed to claims from its customers as a result. In addition, we could become subject to governmental enforcement actions and litigation (including private party litigation) in the event we experience a data privacy breach or we fail to comply with federal and state data privacy requirements (including the California Consumer Privacy Act) relating to information on our customers and others with whom we do business, the results of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\n\u00b7 Our controls over financial reporting and related governance procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. We maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and customer or employee fraud, and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable, not absolute, certainty that the objectives of the system will be met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls, are not insured against, or are in excess of our insurance limits. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u00b7 We may not be successful in raising additional capital needed in the future.\nIf additional capital is needed in the future as a result of losses, our business strategy (including any acquisitions we may make) or regulatory requirements, our efforts to raise such additional capital may be unsuccessful or shares sold in the future may be sold at prices or on terms that are not equal to or better than the current market price. The inability to raise additional capital when needed or at prices and terms acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategies.\n\u00b7 The effects of legislation in response to credit conditions may adversely affect us.\nLegislation that has or may be passed at the federal level and/or by the State of California in response to conditions affecting credit markets could cause us to experience higher credit losses if such legislation reduces the amount that the Bank\u2019s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Such legislation could also result in the imposition of limitations upon the Bank\u2019s ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or make foreclosure less economically feasible. Such events could result in increased loan and lease losses and require a material increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses.\n\u00b7 The effects of changes to FDIC insurance coverage limits and assessments are uncertain and increased premiums may adversely affect us.\nFDIC insurance premium assessments are uncertain and increased premium assessments may adversely affect our earnings. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d). Bank failures increased significantly during the economic downturn causing the FDIC to take control of failed institutions and guarantee payment from the DIF up to the insured limit for deposits held at such failed institutions. Any deterioration of economic conditions may cause losses which require premium increases to replenish the DIF.\n\u00b7 In the future we may be required to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities, including the FHLB stock we hold.\nOur securities portfolio currently includes securities with unrecognized losses. We may continue to observe declines in the fair market value of these securities. We evaluate the securities portfolio for any other than temporary impairment each reporting period, as required by generally accepted accounting principles, and as of December 31, 2019, we did not recognize any securities as other than temporarily impaired. Future evaluations of the securities portfolio may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to these and other holdings. In addition, as a condition to membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the \u201cFHLB\u201d), we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2019, we held stock in the FHLB totaling $4.3 million. The FHLB stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. The FHLB currently distributes cash dividends on its shares, however, past dividend paying practices are not a guarantee of future dividends. To date, we have not recognized any impairment charges related to our FHLB stock holdings. Any future negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings.\n\u00b7 If our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance and reputational. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\u00b7 Our modest size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur modest size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions which are generally larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. As a smaller institution, we are also disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\n\u00b7 We face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nOur ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as we expand. Similar to other corporations, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events. As discussed below, we are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial records and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of our technology systems. Additionally, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.\nWe monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. Specifically, we provide our own core systems processing and essential web hosting. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. If we experience difficulties, fail to comply with banking regulations or keep up with increasingly sophisticated technologies, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace them, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 We are dependent upon relationships with various third parties with respect to the operations of American River Bank, and our relationships with such third parties, some of which are material to us, could adversely affect our business.\nThe Bank has entered into numerous arrangements with third parties with respect to the operations of its business. Upon the expiration of the then-current term, any such agreements may not be renewed by the third party or may be renewed on terms less favorable to the Bank. In some cases, such agreements may permit the third party to unilaterally prescribe certain business practices and procedures with respect to the Bank. To the extent any agreement with a service provider is terminated, we may not be able to secure alternate service providers, and, even if we do, the terms with alternate providers may not be as favorable as those currently in place. In addition, were we to lose any of our significant third-party providers, it could cause a material disruption in our ability to service our customers, which also could have an adverse material impact on us. Moreover, significant disruptions in our ability to provide services could negatively affect the perception of our business, which could result in a loss of confidence and other adverse effects on our business. In addition, if any of our counterparties is unable to or otherwise does not fulfill (or does not timely fulfill) its obligations to us for any reason (including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, computer or other technological interruptions or failures, personnel loss, negative regulatory actions, or acts of God) or engages in fraud or other misconduct during the course of such relationship, we may need to seek alternative third party service providers, or discontinue certain products or programs in their entirety. We may experience situations where we could be held directly or indirectly responsible, or were otherwise subject to liability, for the inability of our third party service providers to perform services for our customers on a timely basis or at all or for actions of third parties undertaken on behalf of the Bank or otherwise in connection with the Bank\u2019s arrangement with such third parties. Any such responsibility or liability in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, including the operations of the Bank and its divisions, and financial results.\n\u00b7 Adherence to our internal policies and procedures by our employees is critical to our performance and how we are perceived by our regulators.\nOur internal policies and procedures are a critical component of our corporate governance and, in some cases, compliance with applicable regulations. We adopt internal policies and procedures to guide management and employees regarding the operation and conduct of our business. Any deviation or non-adherence to these internal policies and procedures, whether intentional or unintentional, could have a material adverse effect on our management, operations or financial condition.\n\u00b7 Existing insurance policies may not adequately protect us and our subsidiaries.\nFidelity, business interruption, cybersecurity, and property insurance policies are in place with respect to our operations. Should any event triggering such policies occur, however, it is possible that our policies would not fully reimburse us for the losses we could sustain due to deductible limits, policy limits, coverage limits, or other factors. We generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, we may need to reduce our policy limits, increase the deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount.\n\u00b7 We must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive and introduce new products and services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technologically driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and introduce new products in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances, to invest in new technology as it becomes available, and to obtain and maintain related essential personnel. Many of our competitors have already implemented critical technologies and have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technologically driven products and services. In addition, we may not have the same ability to rapidly respond to technological innovations as our competitors do. Furthermore, the introduction of new technologies and products by financial technology companies and \u201cfintech\u201d platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain new customers and successfully grow our business. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 Our reputation and financial condition may be harmed by system failures, computer viruses and other technological interruptions to our operations.\nWe rely heavily upon information systems and other operating technologies to efficiently operate and manage our business, including to process transactions through the Internet. Were there to be a failure or a significant impairment in the operation of any of such systems, we may need to develop alternative processes, including to comply with customer safeguard protocols, during which time revenues and profitability may be lower, and there can be no assurance that we could develop or find such an alternative on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any such disruption in the information systems and other operating technologies utilized by the Bank including due to infiltration by hackers or other intruders, could also result in negative publicity and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 We may incur losses due to fraudulent and negligent acts, as well as errors, by third parties or our employees.\nWe may incur losses due to fraudulent or negligent acts, misconduct or errors on the part of third parties with which we do business, our employees and individuals and entities unaffiliated with us, including unauthorized wire and automated clearinghouse transactions, the theft of customer data, customer fraud concerning the value of any relevant collateral, identity theft, the counterfeiting of cards and \u201cskimming\u201d (whereby a skimmer reads a debit card\u2019s encoded mag stripe and a camera records the PIN that is entered by a customer). Additionally, our employees could hide unauthorized activities from us, engage in improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improperly use confidential information. There can be no assurances that the Bank\u2019s program to monitor fraud and other activities will be able to detect all instances of such conduct or that, even if such conduct is detected, we, the Bank, our customers or the third parties with which we do business, including the ATM networks in which the Bank participates, will not be the victims of such activities. Even a single significant instance of fraud, misconduct or other error could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services, cause retail distributors or their customers to cease doing business with us or them, or could lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. Such activities could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including significant monetary fines, and civil claims which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u00b7 Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators, outside auditors or management) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements.\n\u00b7 If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with our acquisition of Bank of Amador or any future acquisitions we could make becomes impaired, it could have an adverse impact on our earnings and capital.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $16.3 million of goodwill on our balance sheet attributable to our merger with Bank of Amador in December 2004. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our goodwill is not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Such evaluation is based on a variety of factors, including the quoted price of our common stock, market prices of the common stock of other banking organizations, common stock trading multiples, discounted cash flows, and data from comparable acquisitions. Future evaluations of goodwill may result in findings of impairment and write-downs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file timely reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\u00b7 We are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the United States Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\n\u00b7 Federal regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe FDIC and DBO periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, interest rate risk and liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to any regulatory actions, including memorandums of understanding or cease and desist orders, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\n\u00b7 As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and recent rulemaking, we are subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nIn July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved new regulatory capital rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new regulatory capital rules not only increase most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, but also introduce a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. The new regulatory capital rules also expand the current definition of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital instruments must meet to be considered additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. In order to be a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d depository institution under the new regime, an institution must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a total capital ratio of 10% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. Institutions must also maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital. The regulatory capital rules became effective as applied to American River Bank on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period that generally extended through January 1, 2019 for many of the changes. The failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and could materially adversely affect customer and investor confidence, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial conditions, generally.\n\u00b7 The FASB has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we provide for credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan and lease losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new CECL standard will become effective for us for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023 and for interim periods thereafter. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan and lease losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. The one-time cumulative effect adjustment to allowance for loan and lease losses will be offset by a charge to retained earnings and therefore reduce equity capital. We have not yet determined the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\u00b7 The effects of terrorism and other events beyond our control, including natural disasters and pandemic disease or viruses, may adversely affect our customers and our results of operations.\nThe terrorist actions on September 11, 2001 and thereafter, as well as the military conflicts in the Middle East, have had significant adverse effects upon the United States economy. Whether terrorist activities in the future and the actions of the United States and its allies in combating terrorism on a worldwide basis will adversely impact us and the extent of such impact is uncertain. Similar events beyond our control including, but not limited to, financial and economic instability and governmental actions in response, natural disasters such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, fires, and similar adverse weather occurrences, disruption of power and energy supplies and communications equipment such as telephones, cellular phones, computers, and other forms of electronic equipment or media, and widespread, adverse public health occurrences including pandemic disease or viruses, may adversely affect our future results of operations by, among other things, disrupting the conduct of our operations and those of our customers, which could result in a reduction in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Bank, increase nonperforming loans and the amounts reserved for loan and lease losses, or cause significant declines in our level of deposits.\n\u00b7 Future acquisitions and expansion activities may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe periodically evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot ensure that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, branches or other assets, as well as other expansion activities, involves various risks including the risks of incorrectly assessing the credit quality of acquired assets, encountering greater than expected costs of incorporating acquired banks or branches into the Bank, executing cost savings measures, and being unable to profitably deploy funds in an acquisition.\n\u00b7 We may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation, as amended, provide the authority to issue without further shareholder approval, 20,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share, of which 5,898,878 shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, at December 31, 2019, employees and directors of the Company had outstanding options to purchase 29,958 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2019, 1,269,229 shares of common stock remained available for awards under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We frequently evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets taking into account our regulatory capital ratios, financial condition and other relevant considerations, and subject to market conditions, we may take further capital actions. Such actions could include, among other things, the issuance of additional shares of common stock in public or private transactions in order to further increase our capital levels above the requirements for a well-capitalized institution established by the federal bank regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory targets or in connection with any acquisitions we may make.\nThe issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities including, without limitation, securities issued upon exercise of outstanding equity awards under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (or any future equity incentive plans we may adopt), could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.\n\u00b7 Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, our common stock ranks junior to all our customer deposits and indebtedness, whether now existing or hereafter incurred, and other non-equity claims on us, with respect to assets available to satisfy claims. Additionally, holders of common stock are subject to the prior liquidation rights of the holders of any debt we may issue in the future and may be subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future.\n\u00b7 The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of common stock they own at times or at prices they find attractive.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. As a result, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur. This may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of common stock they own at times or at prices they find attractive. The low trading volume in our common shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market means that our shares may have less liquidity than other publicly traded companies. We cannot ensure that the volume of trading in our common shares will be maintained or will increase in the future.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and which may be beyond our control, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, future sales or offerings of our equity or equity related securities, and other factors identified above in the forward-looking statement discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and below. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u00a7 actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u00a7 changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our common stock or those of other financial institutions;\n\u00a7 failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u00a7 speculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation, our market area, our competitors or the financial services industry in general;\n\u00a7 strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u00a7 actions by our current shareholders, including sales of common stock by existing shareholders and/or directors and executive officers;\n\u00a7 fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u00a7 future sales of our equity, equity-related or debt securities;\n\u00a7 changes in the frequency or amount of dividends or share repurchases;\n\u00a7 proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u00a7 anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involves or affects us;\n\u00a7 trading activities in our common stock, including short-selling;\n\u00a7 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u00a7 general U.S. and international market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nA significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for our shareholders.\n\u00b7 We may be unable or choose not to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on a variety of factors. The Company relies on distributions from the Bank in the form of cash dividends in order to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. Cash dividends may or may not be paid in the future since they are subject to regulatory restrictions and to evaluation by our Board of Directors of financial factors including, but not limited to, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements.\n\u00b7 Anti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and California law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders) and for holders of our common stock to receive any related takeover premium for their common stock, including advance notice procedures for shareholder proposals and the authorization of 10,000,000 shares of blank-check preferred stock. We are also subject to certain provisions of California law and federal law that would delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88719, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AMRB"}
