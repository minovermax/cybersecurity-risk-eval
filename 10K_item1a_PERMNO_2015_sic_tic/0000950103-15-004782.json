{"cik": "1293593", "company": "Synutra International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. The following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may face liquidity challenges to meet our debt obligations and may require additional funding in the future.\nOur operations rely heavily on debt, and at March 31, 2015, we had short-term debt of $145.6 million, long-term debt due within one year of $130.4 million and long term debt of $144.6 million. In addition, in connection with the construction of the drying facility in Carhaix, France, we will need additional funding but may not be able to secure financing on satisfactory terms, which could decrease our working capital. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, domestic and foreign economic conditions and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. As a result, there can be no assurance that our operation will generate sufficient cash flows to meet our liquidity needs, and we therefore may have negative cash flows in the future. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to obtain additional financing in the future, and such additional financing may not be available at times, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may not be able to repay such borrowings in full or at all when due and, if we were to default on the repayment of these borrowings, we may not be able to continue our operations as a going concern.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumers\u2019 perception of the safety and quality of our products. Any ill effects, product liability claims, recalls, adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding particular ingredients or products or our industry in general could harm our reputation, damage our brand and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe sell products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination, spoilage and tampering. We may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. Adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding particular ingredients, our products, our actions relating to our products, or our industry in general could result in a substantial drop in demand for our products. This negative public perception may include publicity regarding the safety or quality of particular ingredients or products in general, of other companies or of our products or ingredients specifically. Negative public perception may also arise from regulatory investigations or product liability claims, regardless of whether those investigations involve us or whether any product liability claim is successful against us.\nOn September 16, 2008, China\u2019s Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, or China AQSIQ, announced its finding that the formula products of 22 Chinese formula producers, including certain lots of our U-Smart products, were contaminated by melamine, a substance not approved for use in food and linked to the illness and deaths of infants and children in China. There were six reported deaths and approximately 300,000 children suffered kidney-related illnesses due to the contaminated infant formula of one of our competitors. This contamination incident resulted in significant negative publicity for the entire domestic dairy and formula industries in China and demand for domestically-produced dairy and formula products, including our products, declined significantly since September 2008 until late 2009. We recalled our affected U-Smart products as well as all other products produced at the same facilities in the Hebei and Inner Mongolia regions of China, where we believe the contaminated milk supplies originated. We also suspended production at our facilities in Qingdao, Hebei and Inner Mongolia for two weeks pending government and internal investigations. The total cost of this action was $100.6 million which was recognized as a change to cost of sales, selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income mostly in fiscal year 2009.\nAlthough we have not confirmed any cases of kidney-related or other illnesses caused by our products, we cannot assure you that such cases will not surface in the future. The Chinese government has provided medical screening, treatment, and care for consumers affected by melamine contamination in infant formula products. We contributed a net amount of $2.3 million to a compensation fund set up by China Dairy Industry Association in fiscal 2009 to settle existing and potential claims arising in China from families of infants affected by melamine contamination. We cannot assure you that the Chinese government will not seek further reimbursement from dairy and formula product manufacturers, including us.\nWe believe the melamine contamination incident negatively impacted our brand and reputation in China. It also affected investor confidence in us as reflected by the significant decrease in our stock price after September 16, 2008. We cannot predict whether there will be similar future incidents and what impact such incidents may have on our operations and reputation.\nIn August 2010, several media reports alleging our infant formula products caused symptoms of hormone-triggered sexual prematurity in infants in the Hubei province of China. One of the media later issued an apology video clip on its official website acknowledging their allegation as without proof. Despite the apology, our business was significantly and negatively impacted since then as a result of these media reports, and our sales volume decreased significantly. We increased the spending on advertising after the prematurity event to repair our reputation and regain market share. As a result, we had a significant net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.\nIn the past, there have also been occurrences of counterfeiting and imitation of products in China that have been widely publicized. We cannot guarantee that contamination or counterfeiting or imitation of our or similar products will not occur in the future or that we will be able to detect it and deal with it effectively. Any occurrence of contamination or counterfeiting or imitation could negatively impact our corporate and brand image or consumers\u2019 perception of our products or similar nutritional products generally, particularly if the counterfeit or imitation products cause injury or death to consumers. For example, in April 2004, sales of counterfeit and substandard infant formula in Anhui, China caused the deaths of 13 infants as well as harming many others. Although this incident did not involve the counterfeiting of our products, it caused significant negative publicity for the entire infant formula industry in China. The mere publication of information asserting that infant formula ingredients or products may be harmful could have a material adverse effect on us, regardless of whether these reports are scientifically supported or concern our products or the raw materials used in our products.\nWe believe that the melamine contamination incident, the prematurity event and any other adverse news related to formula products in China will also result in increased regulatory scrutiny of our industry, which may result in increased costs and reduce our margins and profitability. The government has enhanced its regulations on the industry aimed to ensure the safety and quality of dairy products, including but not limited to compulsory batch by batch inspection. This is likely to increase our operating costs and capital expenditure.\nIf we fail to obtain raw materials in the quantity and the quality we need, and at commercially acceptable prices, our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business requires certain key raw materials, such as milk powder and whey powder. We may experience a shortage in the supply of certain raw materials in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our production and results of operations. While our agreements with Sodiaal and Euroserum are intended to provide our supplies in the future, the drying facility in Carhaix, France is not expected to be operational until late 2015 see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d further details. Other than these agreements, we currently do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any other raw material suppliers, and some of our suppliers may, without notice or penalty, terminate their relationship with us at any time. We also rely on a small number of suppliers for some of our raw materials, such as whey powder and imported milk powder. We now use imported milk powder from New Zealand for all of our powered formula products as consumers have less confidence in domestically-produced milk powder. If any supplier is unwilling or unable to provide us with high quality raw materials in required quantities and at acceptable prices, we may be unable to find alternative sources or at commercially acceptable prices, on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Our inability to find or develop alternative sources could result in delays or reductions in production, product shipments or a reduction in our profit margins. Moreover, these suppliers may delay material shipments or supply us with inferior quality raw materials that may adversely impact the timely delivery or the quality of our products. If any of these events were to occur, our product quality, competitive position, reputation and business could suffer.\nIn addition, most of the raw materials used in our business are imported, such as whey powder and milk powder. Our imported raw materials are subject to various PRC governmental permit requirements, approval procedures and import duties, and may also, from time to time, be subject to export controls and other legal restrictions imposed by foreign countries. Should the PRC government refuse to issue the necessary permits or approvals to us or our suppliers, or take any administrative actions to limit imports of certain raw materials, or if we or our suppliers fail to pay any required import duties, or if governmental agencies or laws of foreign countries prevent the timely export of certain raw materials we require to China, our ability to produce and sell our products in China could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, import duties increase the cost of our products and may make them less competitive.\nFinally, certain suppliers of raw materials within our supply chain may contaminate our raw material supplies or provide us with substandard raw material supplies that adversely impact the quality of our products exposing our customers to health risks and damaging our reputation, brand and financial condition. For a more detailed description of this risk, and in particular the impact of the melamine contamination incident in China, see Part 1 - Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are highly dependent upon consumers\u2019 perception of the safety and quality of our products. Any ill effects, product liability claims, recalls, adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding particular ingredients or products or our industry in general could harm our reputation, damage our brand and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny interruption in our supply of milk powder could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.\nWe currently import all of the milk powder used in the powdered formula production from New Zealand. The continuity of the milk powder supplies is of critical importance to our business. The importation of milk powder is influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including, among other: (1) export control policy in the originating countries, (2) China\u2019s government policy and regulation on milk powder importation as well as China\u2019s custom inspection standards and (3) acts of God such as natural disasters. Any interruption in our milk powder supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, we currently source all of our milk powder from one supplier, Fonterra. If Fonterra fails to deliver the milk powder we need on the terms we have agreed, we may not be able to find an alternative source at a comparable price or on other favorable terms, and any delays in securing an alternative source could result in production delays and late shipments of our products to distributors and end customers.\nOur results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in availability and price of raw materials.\nThe raw materials we use are subject to price fluctuations due to various factors beyond our control, including increasing market demand, inflation, severe climatic and environmental conditions, commodity price fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in governmental and agricultural regulations and programs and other factors. We also expect that our raw material prices will continue to fluctuate and be affected by inflation in the future. Changes to our raw materials prices may result in increases in production and packaging costs, and we may be unable to raise the prices of our products to offset these increased costs in the short-term or at all. As a result, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe might face inventory write-downs if we are unable to effectively manage inventory levels and/or prices decline. We maintain inventories of raw materials and finished products, and our inventories may spoil.\nMost of our finished products have an average shelf life of 18 to 24 months before the product is opened. Milk powder has a shelf life of 24 months. Whey powder has a shelf life of 12 months. Other additives have a shelf life from several months to several years. Our inventory levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales. We may in future periods experience inventory buildup if our sales slow for any reason. Any unexpected significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products than we require, thereby increasing our risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny major outbreak of illness or disease relating to cows in the regions in which we import milk powder could lead to significant shortfalls in the supply of our milk powder, and could result in consumers avoiding dairy products, which could result in substantial declines in our sales and possibly substantial losses.\nWe import all of our milk powder from New Zealand, and all of our whey powder from France. A major outbreak of any illness or disease in cows globally could lead to a serious loss of consumer confidence in, and demand for, dairy products. A major outbreak of mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), bovine tuberculosis, or bovine TB, or other serious disease in the principal regions supplying milk powder could lead to significant shortfalls in the supply of milk powder. Furthermore, adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying dairy products or cause production and delivery disruptions. If consumers generally were to avoid our products, our sales would decline substantially and we could suffer substantial losses.\nWe may experience problems with product quality or product performance, or the perception of such problems, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation or result in a decrease in customers and revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share.\nOur operating results depend, in part, on our ability to deliver high quality products on a timely and cost-effective manner. Our quality control and food safety management systems are complex. For example, there are over 1,100 quality control points throughout the whole production process. If the quality of any of our products deteriorated, it could result in delays in shipments, cancellations of orders or customer returns and complaints, loss of goodwill, and harm to our brand and reputation. In addition, following the melamine contamination incident, we purchase all of the milk powder used for our powdered formula products from New Zealand. We may be unable to exercise the same degree of quality control over this overseas supplier as we can over our own facilities. Any quality problems associated with the milk powder produced by this supplier would also affect our products\u2019 quality and lead to negative publicity against us, materially and adversely affecting our reputation and brand, and causing a decrease in sales of our products and a loss of market share. For example, the melamine contamination incident in China has resulted in certain of our products being contaminated, impacting our brand and reputation.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.\nAs with other infant formula producers, we are also exposed to risks associated with product liability claims if the consumption of infant formula products we sell results in injury or death. We cannot predict what impact such product liability claims or resulting negative publicity would have on our business or on our brand image. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, diversion of management resources and require us to make significant payments and incur substantial legal expenses. We do not have product liability insurance for powdered formula products sold in China and have not made provisions for potential product liability claims. Therefore, we may not have adequate resources to satisfy a judgment if a successful claim is brought against us. Even if a product liability claim is not successfully pursued to judgment by a claimant, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim and our brand image and reputation would suffer. Finally, serious product quality concerns could result in governmental actions against us, which, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, loss of certain licenses, or other governmental penalties.\nOur sales, results of operations, brand image and reputation could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to efficiently manage our operations without interruption, or fail to ensure that our products are delivered on time.\nOur business requires successful coordination of several sequential and complex processes, the disruption of any of which could interrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our relationships with our distributors, sub-distributors and end-customers, our brand name and reputation, and our financial performance. Our operations involve the coordination of raw material sourcing from third parties, internal production processes and external distribution processes. We may face difficulties in coordinating the various aspects of our production processes, resulting in downtime and delays.\nIn addition, we may encounter interruptions in our production processes due to a catastrophic loss or events beyond our control, such as fires, explosions, labor disturbances, earthquakes or other natural disasters. If there is a stoppage in production at any of our facilities, even if only temporary, or delays in deliveries to our customers, our business and reputation could be materially and adversely affected. Along with many other producers of dairy and consumer products in China, we generally rely on third-party logistics companies and distributors for the delivery of our products. Delivery may be disrupted for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including natural disasters, weather conditions or social unrest and strikes, which could lead to delayed or lost deliveries. In addition, transportation and related infrastructure conditions are often generally under-developed in some of the regions where we sell our products. We currently do not have business interruption insurance to offset these potential losses, delays and risks, so a material interruption of our business operations could materially damage our business.\nWe rely primarily on third-party distributors and cannot assure you that their marketing and distribution of our products will be effective or will not harm our brand and reputation. Moreover, if we fail to timely identify and appoint additional or replacement distributors as needed, or are unable to successfully manage our distribution network, our operating results could suffer.\nWe primarily rely on third-party distributors and sub-distributors for the distribution and sales of our products. We sell our products through an extensive nationwide distribution and sales network covering all of the provinces and provincial-level municipalities in mainland China. As of March 31, 2015, this network comprised over 740 independent distributors and over 310 independent sub-distributors who sell our products in approximately 21,000 retail outlets. Our distributors normally have exclusive distribution rights in their respective regions, and are also responsible for developing the sub-distributors located in their own regions. In addition, our distributors are not required to exclusively distribute our products. We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with distributors and have no control over their everyday business activities. Consequently, our distributors may engage in activities that are prohibited under our arrangements with them, that violate PRC laws and regulations governing the dairy industry or other PRC laws and regulations generally, or that are otherwise harmful to our business or our reputation. Due to our dependence on distributors for the sale and distribution of our products to retail outlets, any one of the following events could cause material fluctuations or declines in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our distributors;\n\u25cf selection or increased sales by our distributors of our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u25cf our failure to timely identify and appoint additional or replacement distributors upon the loss of one or more of our distributors.\nThe competition for distributors is intense in our industry in China and many of our competitors are expanding their distribution networks in China. We may not be able to compete successfully against the larger and better-funded sales and marketing operations of some of our current or future competitors, especially if these competitors provide more favorable arrangements for distributors. As a result, we may lose some of our distributors to our competitors, which may cause us to lose some or all of our favorable arrangements with such distributors and may even result in the termination of our relationships with some of our distributors. While we do not believe we are substantially dependent upon any individual distributor, finding replacement distributors could be time-consuming and any resulting delay may be disruptive and costly to our business. In addition, we may not be able to successfully manage our distributors and the cost of any consolidation or further expansion of our distribution network may exceed the revenue generated from these efforts. The occurrence of any of these factors could result in a significant decrease in the sales volume of our products and therefore materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe initiated a \u201cgold mining\u201d marketing strategy (\u201cthe Strategy Gold Mining\u201c) in September 2012 to strengthen our management of the sales channel, the goal of which is to use marketing and promotional expenditures more effectively and to improve net profit by centrally monitoring the spending in each retail outlet. We have terminated our relationship with those retail outlets with low sales volume and a low yield rate on the slotting fees, to focus our resources on those retail outlets with high sales volume and a higher yield rate on the slotting fees. As a result, our number of retail outlets reduced from more than 60,000 at June 30, 2012 to approximately 27,000 at March 31, 2013. The Gold Mining Strategy was substantially completed by March 31, 2013. We cannot be certain that the Gold Mining Strategy will produce the results as planned in the long term.\nOur results of operations and business prospects may be impaired by changing consumer preferences if we do not develop and offer products to meet changing preferences.\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and nutritional needs of our customers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. We introduce new products and improved products from time to time and incur significant development and marketing costs. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, then our strategy to grow sales and profits with new products will be less successful.\nMore mothers may breastfeed their babies rather than use our products, resulting in reduced demand for our products and adversely affecting our revenues.\nOur results of operations are affected by the number of mothers who choose to use our products rather than breastfeeding their babies. Much publicly available data suggests that breastfeeding has many health benefits for the baby that cannot be replicated by dairy-based infant formula products. Additionally, popular literature, cultural pressure, government policies and medical advice in China generally promote the benefits of breastfeeding. For example, on August 1, 2007, China\u2019s Ministry of Health (\u201cMOH\u201d) issued an Infant Feeding Strategy which promoted breastfeeding and requested all local relevant departments to publicize the benefits of breastfeeding through radio broadcasting, television and newspapers during World Breastfeeding Week, which took place in early August 2007. In November 2011, the MOH of China submitted a proposal for public review that could ban promotions and advertising of infant formula for babies younger than six months. Thus, to the extent that private, public and government sources increasingly promote the benefits of breastfeeding, there could be a reduced demand for our products and our revenues could be adversely affected.\nA severe and prolonged downturn in the Chinese or global economy or disruptions in the financial markets may adversely impact our business and results of operations and may limit our access to additional financing.\nThe infant formula industry can be affected by macro economic factors, including changes in national, regional, and local economic conditions, employment levels and consumer spending patterns. A prolonged slowdown in the Chinese or global economy could erode consumer confidence which could result in changes to consumer spending patterns, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, if the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited, we will incur increased costs associated with equity and/or debt financing. It is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt and/or react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates could impact our floating rate debt negatively and increase our debt obligations.\nFailure to execute our future expansion plan could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may increase our annual production capacity in the future to meet any expected increase in demand for our products. Our decision to increase our production capacity is based in part on our projections of increases in our sales volume and growth in the size of the infant formula product market in China. If actual customer demand does not meet our projections, we will likely suffer overcapacity problems and have idle capacity, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our future success depends on our ability to expand our business to address expected growth in demand for our current and future products. Our ability to add production capacity and increase output is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf the availability and cost of additional funding to expand our production capacity, build new processing and packaging facilities, make additional investments in our subsidiaries, acquire additional businesses or production facilities, purchase additional fixed assets and purchase raw materials on favorable terms or at all;\n\u25cf delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control, such as problems with equipment vendors and suppliers of raw materials;\n\u25cf failure to maintain high quality control standards;\n\u25cf global or local shortage of raw materials, such as raw milk or whey powder;\n\u25cf our inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, required approvals by relevant government authorities;\n\u25cf diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and\n\u25cf failure to execute our expansion plan effectively.\nAs our business grows, we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including improvements to our accounting and other internal management systems by dedicating additional resources to our reporting and accounting functions, and improvements to our record keeping and contract tracking system. We will need to respond to competitive market conditions and continue to enhance existing products and develop new products, and retain existing customers and attract new customers. We will also need to recruit more personnel and train and manage our growing employee base. Furthermore, we will need to maintain and expand our relationships with our current and future customers, suppliers, distributors and other third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will succeed.\nIf we encounter any of the risks described above, or are otherwise unable to establish or successfully operate additional production capacity or to increase production output, we may be unable to grow our business and revenues, reduce our operating costs, maintain our competitiveness or improve our profitability, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nAs discussed in \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d, we entered into a series of agreements with Sodiaal Union and Euroserum SAS relating to a long-term industrial and commercial partnership. Under the agreements, we are committed to building a new drying facility in Carhaix, France, intended to manufacture powdered milk and fat-enriched demineralized whey powder. The updated estimated cost to build the facility is approximately \u20ac 161.0 million. There is no assurance whether we will be able to obtain further financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, we cannot be certain whether the facility will produce the quality and quantity of products as planned and whether the facility will encounter any mechanical or other issues in the future. Any of these issues could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial results.\nAny future expansion into new markets that we are currently not significantly represented may be costly, time-consuming and difficult. If we do not successfully expand into new, high growth markets we have identified, our results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success may depend upon our ability to successfully expand into markets that we currently have low penetration rates. To further promote our brand and generate demand for our products in such markets, we may increase our spending on marketing and promotion in specific geographical areas or channels. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of distributors or penetrate a sufficient number of retail outlets to justify the spending on marketing and promotion in these markets, or our selected distributors or outlets may not be suitable for selling our products in these markets for other reasons. We may also fail to attract new customers in such markets who may have less familiarity with our brand and products. Furthermore, we may fail to anticipate and address competitive conditions in these new markets that are different from those in our existing primary markets. These competitive conditions may make it difficult or impossible for us to effectively operate in these markets. If our expansion efforts in existing and new markets are unsuccessful, our results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nPart of our strategy involves the development of new products and new business segments, and if we fail to timely develop new products or we incorrectly gauge the potential market for new products, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nWe plan to utilize our in-house research and development capabilities to develop new products that could become new sources of revenue for us in the future and help us to diversify our revenue base. In addition to our core nutritional food business, we have also entered into other business segments such as the nutritional supplement segment. Our future research and development efforts will focus on further expanding our product offerings beyond dairy-based nutritional products. If we fail to timely develop these and other new products or if we incorrectly gauge market demand for such new products, we may not be able to grow our sales revenue at expected growth rates and may incur expenses and capital expenditure costs relating to the development of new products that do not generate a positive return on the investment.\nWe operate in a competitive environment, which may lead to declining revenue growth or other circumstances that would negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe market for pediatric nutritional products is competitive, and we believe that competition in this market will continue to intensify. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are brand recognition, quality, advertising, formulation, packaging, and price. We face significant competition from a number of competitors, including multinational companies, such as Abbot Laboratories\u2019 Ross Products Division, Mead Johnson, Nestle, FrieslandCampina, Numico and Wyeth, and domestic companies, such as Biostime, Beingmate, Yashili, Feihe and Yili. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition\u201d. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, significantly larger market shares, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial resources and economies of scale in financial, sales and marketing, production, distribution, technical and other resources than we do. Some of these competitors have used, and we expect will continue to use, more aggressive pricing strategies, greater amounts of incentives and subsidies for distributors, retailers and customers and more advanced processes and technologies. Furthermore, consolidation among industry participants in China may potentially result in stronger domestic competitors that are better able to compete as end-to-end suppliers as well as competitors who are more specialized in particular areas and geographic markets. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, as a result of the melamine contamination incident, customers have lost confidence in infant formula produced by domestic companies for the time being, which gives multinational infant formula companies an advantage over us.\nIn order to compete successfully in our markets, we will need to continue to restore customer confidence in our brand and products, develop new products and enhance our product offerings while maintaining price competitiveness. Even if we successfully restore customer confidence, if and to the extent we fail to develop new products that differentiate us from our competitors, we may need to compete largely on price, which may cause our operating margins to decline. Our inability to compete successfully against competitors and pricing pressures could result in lost customers, loss of market share and reduced operating margins, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we grant employee stock options and other stock-based compensation in the future, we will be required to recognize stock-based compensation expense, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not granted any stock-based compensation and thus have not been required to reflect any such expenses in our results of operations. We adopted a stock -based compensation plan in June 2008 and may grant certain employees and directors stock-based compensation, which we believe could be important to attract and retain key personnel. We will be required to account for compensation costs for all stock options, including stock options granted to our directors and employees, using the fair value method and recognize the expense in our consolidated statement of operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or the FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and make sales in China, which may experience corruption. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our company, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In additions, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability of FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nIf we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or prevent fraud.\nWe have previously experienced certain material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, a material weakness was identified. A material weakness is defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have taken steps to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and we believe that the material weakness previously identified has been fully remediated as of March 31, 2013. However, there can be no assurance that any current or future deficiencies will not contribute to, or cause, possible material weaknesses in the future or, that we will be able to implement effectively new or improved controls. In addition, our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective in the future.\nMoreover, a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting in the future could cause us to fail to provide accurate financial statements or fail to meet our reporting obligations, either of which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Our failure to meet our reporting obligations in a timely fashion may also lead to the delisting of our common stock by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nOur success depends to a substantial degree upon our senior management and key personnel, and our business operations may be significantly and negatively affected if we fail to attract and retain highly competent senior management and key personnel.\nOur future success depends substantially on the continued services of our key personnel including, particularly, Liang Zhang, our chairman and chief executive officer. We rely substantially on their experience in the dairy and nutritional products industry, and on their relationships and ability to work with our suppliers and distributors and other customers. If we lose the services of one or more of these key personnel, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all, with suitable or qualified candidates, and may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers and key personnel, which could severely disrupt our business and growth. We do not maintain key-man life insurance for any of our key personnel.\nIn addition, if any of these key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our distributors. We have entered into employment agreements with each of these key personnel, which contain confidentiality and non-competition provisions. However, if any disputes were to arise between these key personnel and us, it is not clear, in light of uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, what the court decisions would be and the extent to which these court decisions could be enforced in China, where most of these key personnel reside and hold some of their assets. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Associated with Doing Business in China-Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\u201d Furthermore, as we expect to continue to expand our operations and develop new products, we will need to continue attracting and retaining experienced management and key research and development personnel.\nCompetition for experienced management and research and development personnel in China is intense, and the availability of experienced, suitable and qualified candidates is limited. Competition for these individuals may require us to pay higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain them, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may also be unable to attract or retain the personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives, and any failure in this regard could severely disrupt our business and growth.\nLiang Zhang\u2019s association with other businesses could impede his ability to devote sufficient time to our business and could present potential conflicts of interest.\nLiang Zhang, our founder, chairman, chief executive officer and principal beneficial stockholder, controls several other companies in China. Liang Zhang devotes most of his time to our affairs and the remainder of his time to the affairs of the other companies. Liang Zhang\u2019s decision-making responsibilities for these other companies are similar in the areas of public relations, risk management and strategic planning. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise from time to time and we cannot assure you that they will be resolved in our favor. Additionally, even though Liang Zhang devotes most of his time to our affairs and is further accountable to us and our stockholders as a fiduciary, which requires that he exercise good faith and due care in handling our affairs, we cannot assure you this will always be the case and his existing responsibilities to other businesses and entities may limit the amount of time he can spend on our affairs.\nOur chairman and chief executive officer, Liang Zhang, beneficially owns a substantial amount of our common stock and will have significant influence over our corporate affairs.\nOur founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Liang Zhang, beneficially owns approximately 62.8% of our outstanding common stock through a company owned by his wife as of March 31, 2015. Accordingly, Liang Zhang will be able to direct the outcome of matters requiring approval of the stockholders, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions such as:\n\u00b7 our merger with or into another company;\n\u00b7 a sale of our assets; and\n\u00b7 amendments to our certificate of incorporation.\nThe decisions of Liang Zhang may conflict with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders.\nWe have committed to certain capacity expansion projects that require significant capital investment. Such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have, in the past, obtained loans and sold our common stock to raise additional capital. We have committed to certain capacity expansion projects, in particular the French Project which requires a total investment of \u20ac161.0 million. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate the required equity portion of the investment in the French Project from our operation cash flow, or raise the required debt portion of the French Project investment. Failure to do so may cause us to delay or abandon the French Project, which in turn may lead to the deterioration of our relationship with Euroserum and Sodiaal, and potentially other material adverse impact on our business. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and such additional equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our existing common stock. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or obtain funds for required payments of interest and principal on such additional indebtedness, we will be in default. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.\nWe have limited property insurance coverage and do not carry any business interruption insurance.\nOperation of our facilities involves many risks, including equipment failures, natural disasters, industrial accidents, power outages, labor disturbances and other business interruptions. Furthermore, if any of our products are faulty or contaminated, then we may become subject to product liability claims or we may have to engage in a product recall.\nWe do not carry any business interruption insurance, and have limited property insurance coverage. Therefore, our existing insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all risks associated with our business. As a result, we may be required to pay for financial and other losses, damages and liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, out of our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, all of the costs we have incurred to date and may incur in the future that are related to our product recall in connection with the melamine contamination incident is not covered by our existing insurance policies.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.\nWe rely primarily on trade secrets and other contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. We have not registered or applied for protections in China for most of our intellectual property or proprietary technologies relating to the formulations of powdered infant formula that we produce. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we also rely in part on nondisclosure agreements with our employees, licensing partners, third-party producers, consultants, agents and other organizations to which we disclose our proprietary information. The actions we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. As a result, third parties may use the intellectual property or proprietary technologies that we have developed and compete with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nPRC intellectual property-related laws and their implementation are still under development. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or many other countries. In addition, policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of any such litigation may not be in our favor. Given the relative unpredictability of China\u2019s legal system and potential difficulties enforcing a court judgment in China, there is no guarantee that we would be able to halt the unauthorized use of our intellectual property through litigation in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, any such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention away from our business and cause us to expend significant resources. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects and reputation. In addition, we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely against us, could disrupt our business and subject us to significant liability to third parties.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our know-how and product formulations without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties. The holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our product offerings may be unknown to us or may otherwise make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms.\nThere may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by others which could damage our ability to rely on such technologies. In addition, although we endeavor to ensure that companies that work with us possess appropriate intellectual property rights or licenses, we cannot fully avoid the risks of intellectual property rights infringement created by suppliers of raw materials used in our products, our third-party producers, or by companies with which we work in cooperative research and development activities. Our current or potential competitors, many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have obtained or may obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products in China or other countries. The defense of intellectual property claims, including patent infringement suits, and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time-consuming, and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceeding to which we may become a party could cause us to:\n\u00b7 pay damage awards;\n\u00b7 seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u00b7 pay additional ongoing royalties, which could decrease our profit margins;\n\u00b7 redesign our products, which may be costly, if possible at all; or\n\u00b7 be restricted by injunctions.\nThese factors could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business and result in our customers or potential customers deferring, canceling or limiting their purchase or use of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could materially adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nRisks Associated With Doing Business in China\nAdverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could impede the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and damage our business.\nWe conduct our operations and generate all of our revenues in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:\n\u00b7 the higher level of government involvement and regulation;\n\u00b7 the early stage of development of the market-oriented sector of the economy;\n\u00b7 the rapid growth rate;\n\u00b7 the higher rate of inflation;\n\u00b7 the higher level of control over foreign exchange; and\n\u00b7 government control over the allocation of many resources.\nAs the PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy, the PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. While these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, they may also have a negative effect on us.\nAlthough the PRC government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the PRC government continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the PRC economy through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in PRC laws and regulations, including those relating to how we conduct our business, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in PRC properties or joint ventures.\nPRC food hygiene and safety laws may become more onerous, which may adversely affect our operations and financial performance and lead to an increase in our costs which we may be unable to pass on to our customers.\nOperators within the PRC dairy industry and infant formula sector are subject to compliance with PRC food hygiene and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations require all enterprises engaged in the production of dairy and infant formula products to obtain a hygiene license. They also set out hygiene standards with respect to food and food additives, packaging and containers, and labeling on packaging as well as hygiene requirements for food production and sites, facilities and equipment used for the transportation and the sale of food. Failure to comply with PRC food hygiene and safety laws may result in fines, suspension of operations, loss of hygiene license and, in certain cases, criminal proceedings against an enterprise and its management. Although we are in compliance with current PRC food hygiene and safety laws and regulations, in the event that such laws and regulations become more stringent or widen in scope, we may fail to comply with such laws, or if we comply, our production and distribution costs may increase, and we may be unable to pass these additional costs on to our customers. For example, in response to the melamine contamination incident, the PRC State Council abolished the regulations on inspection exemptions for food on September 18, 2008 so that our products were to be subject to batch by batch inspection going forward. In addition, the PRC State Council promulgated with immediate effect the Regulation on Supervision and Administration of Quality and Safety of Dairy Products on October 9, 2008 which, among other things, imposes more stringent requirements for inspection, production, packaging, labeling and product recall on dairy product producers. These measures have increased our costs in the past and are likely to continue to contribute to our costs in the future, which costs we may be unable to pass on to our customers.\nChanges in the regulatory environment for dairy and infant nutrition products in China could negatively impact our business.\nThe dairy and infant nutrition product industries in China are regulated and regulatory changes may affect both our customers and us. Any changes in regulations that impose additional requirements for construction of new production lines and facilities or expansion of existing facilities will require us to secure additional government approvals for our current production expansion projects. Similarly, additional safety and quality control regulations could impact our costs of production. For example, in December 2013, the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration updated the national guidance for the renewal and re-affirmation of production licenses for manufacturing infant-formula milk powder products in China. This regulation sets forth new rules and raises the bar on infant formula producers in nine areas, including product safety control, purchase of raw materials, formula product inspection, manufacturing process and product traceability. In particular, the requirement on a 100,000 grade clean space to meet the medical grade Good Manufacturing Practices is widely considered as the most challenging requirement. For a more detailed description of these requirements, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation\u201d. Although we believe our existing entities and facilities meet the requirements, it is possible that our entities may fail to meet one or more of the additional requirements in the future. Failure to comply with these or any other changes in regulations affecting our business could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations, including failure to renew our production licenses. In addition, the indirect impact of any such changes could adversely affect our business even if the specific regulations do not directly apply to our products or us.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct our business through our operating subsidiaries in China. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference, but have limited precedential value. Over the past several decades, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nIf we are found to have failed to comply with applicable laws, we may incur additional expenditures or be subject to significant fines and penalties.\nOur operations are subject to PRC laws and regulations applicable to us. However, many PRC laws and regulations are uncertain in their scope, and the implementation of such laws and regulations in different localities could have significant differences. In certain instances, local implementation rules and/or the actual implementation are not necessarily consistent with the regulations at the national level. Although we strive to comply with all the applicable PRC laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government authorities will not later determine that we have not been in compliance with certain laws or regulations. For example, there is a PRC regulation requiring all employees to make contributions to a housing fund based on their salary level and their employers to match such contributions. However, many employees are reluctant to make such contributions as they do not perceive such contribution will benefit them, and this regulation has generally not been rigorously enforced. We have allowed our employees to make contributions on a voluntary basis and then match their contributions. However, we cannot assure you that in the future the PRC government will not start to enforce this regulation more rigorously. Although there are no material penalties stipulated in this regulation, if we are found not to be in compliance, we may be required to bring current any past deficiencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the PRC State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the PRC State Administration of Taxation, the PRC Ministry of Health and Hygiene Permitting Office, the PRC General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the PRC State Food and Drug Administration Bureau relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. Our failure to comply with these and other applicable laws and regulations in China could subject us to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, as well as civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls of our products. It is possible that changes to such laws, more rigorous enforcement of such laws or with respect to our current or past practices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, additional environmental, health or safety issues relating to matters that are not currently known to management may result in unanticipated liabilities and expenditures.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively.\nAll of our sales revenue is denominated in Renminbi. Under PRC law, the Renminbi is currently convertible under the \u201ccurrent account,\u201d which includes dividends and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the \u201ccapital account,\u201d which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our PRC operating subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior SAFE approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, after complying with certain procedural requirements, our PRC subsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders.\nPRC regulations relating to investment activities by, and holdings in entities outside of China of, PRC residents and citizens, may subject our PRC resident and citizen stockholders to personal liability and limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially and adversely affect us.\nIn October 2005, SAFE issued a public notice, the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, or Notice 75. In May 2007, SAFE issued the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Operating Procedures Concerning Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund Raising and Return Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or Notice 106. According to Notice 75 and Notice 106, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for PRC residents to establish or to control an offshore company for the purposes of financing that offshore company with assets or equity interests in an onshore enterprise located in the PRC. An amendment to registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC resident is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise in the offshore company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the capital of the offshore company. Moreover, Notice 75 and Notice 106 apply retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who have established or acquired control of offshore companies that have made onshore investments in the PRC in the past were required to complete the relevant registration with the local SAFE branch. If any PRC stockholder of any offshore special purpose company fails to make the required SAFE registration and amendment, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore special purpose company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore special purpose company. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nMany of the terms and provisions in Notice 75 and Notice 106 remain unclear and implementation by central SAFE and local SAFE branches of Notice 75 and Notice 106 have been inconsistent since their adoption. Based on the advice of our PRC counsel, De Heng Law Offices, and after consultation with relevant SAFE officials, our PRC resident stockholders and the PRC resident beneficial stockholders of Meitek may be required to complete their respective SAFE registrations pursuant to Notice 75 and Notice 106. The local SAFE branch may not accept their applications for SAFE registration until more detailed rules or announcements concerning the penalties for those who failed to make their SAFE registrations are implemented. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Notice 75 and Notice 106 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Notice 75 and Notice 106 by our PRC resident beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Notice 75 and Notice 106. We also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect stockholders, the PRC resident beneficial stockholders of Meitek, or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to comply with the SAFE notice, if SAFE requires it, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiary\u2019s ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar/Euro and the Renminbi, and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated, and may affect our net profit margins and result in foreign currency exchange gains or losses on our U.S. dollar/Euro denominated assets and liabilities. Because our earnings and cash assets are primarily denominated in Renminbi, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar/Euro would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars and earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, Euro and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions and China\u2019s foreign exchange policies. In late 2005, China amended its policy of tracking the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. The new policy permitted the Renminbi to fluctuate against a basket of foreign currencies, which caused the Renminbi to appreciate by approximately 21.5% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Since 2008, the Renminbi has fluctuated against other freely traded currencies. In June 2010, the PRC government announced that it would allow greater flexibility for the Renminbi to fluctuate against the U.S. dollar, which resulted in further appreciation of the Renminbi. Between June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2013, the value of the Renminbi appreciated by approximately 12.0% against the U.S. dollar, although in 2014, the value of the Renminbi depreciated approximately 2.5% against the U.S. dollar. We cannot provide any assurances that the policy of the PRC government will not affect or the manner in which it may affect the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currencies.\nCurrently, some of our raw materials and major equipment are imported. In the event that the U.S. dollar/Euro appreciated against the Renminbi, our costs may increase. If we cannot pass the resulting cost increases on to our customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer. In addition, to the extent we enter markets outside China in the future, we may be increasingly subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to our shareholders, and otherwise fund and conduct our businesses.\nOur revenues are earned by our PRC subsidiaries. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividend by our PRC subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Each of our PRC subsidiaries is also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC (\u201cPRC GAAP\u201d) to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in such fund reaches 50% of their registered capitals in China. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the Company\u2019s PRC subsidiaries and PRC affiliates are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company in the form of dividends, loans or advances, which restricted portion amounted to RMB 716.7 million (equivalently $116.7 million) as of March 31, 2015. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nUnder China\u2019s New Enterprise Income Tax Law (\u201cEIT Law\u201d), we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. This classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.\nThe New EIT Law provides that enterprises established outside of China whose \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d are located in China are considered \u201cresident enterprises\u201d and are generally subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on their worldwide income. In addition, a circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises established outside of China as \u201cresident enterprises\u201d clarified that dividends and other income paid by such \u201cresident enterprises\u201d will be considered to be PRC source income, subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when recognized by non-PRC shareholders. This circular also subjects such \u201cresident enterprises\u201d to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities. Under the implementation regulations to the enterprise income tax, a \u201cde facto management body\u201d is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and treasury, and acquisition and disposition of properties and other assets of an enterprise. In addition, the circular mentioned above details that certain Chinese-invested enterprises will be classified as \u201cresident enterprises\u201d if the following are located or reside in China: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders\u2019 meetings; and half or more of the directors or senior management having voting rights. If the PRC tax authorities determine that Synutra, Inc. or Synutra International, Inc. are \u201cresident enterprises,\u201d we may be subject to enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our worldwide income and dividends paid by us to our non-PRC shareholders and, while less clear, capital gains recognized by them with respect to the sale of our stock, may be subject to a PRC withholding tax. This will have an impact on our effective tax rate, a material adverse effect on our net income and results of operations, and may require us to withhold tax on our non-PRC shareholders. We are actively monitoring the \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification rules and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.\nIf we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to tax in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax.\nOur shareholders may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nWe are a Delaware holding company and most of our assets are located outside of the United States. All of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for our shareholders to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. DeHeng Law Offices, our counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or public interest. So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nInflation in China and measures to contain inflation could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in our costs, our business may be materially and adversely affected. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. If imposed in the future, such austerity measures or other measures could lead to a slowing of economic growth. A slowdown in the PRC economy could also materially and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nThe PRC government may deem the control agreements between us and certain of our consolidated affiliated entities to be non-compliant with restrictions on foreign investment and as a result we may be subject to penalties or required to perform a costly restructuring of these entities.\nPRC laws and regulations currently restrict foreign entities from establishing clinical business in China. Foreign entities that wish to establish medical clinical businesses in China must have domestic entities as partners. In order to comply with PRC law and avoid restrictions on foreign investment in medical clinical operations, we operate our medical treatment services (mostly pre-natal diagnostics services) through Beijing Syclin Clinical Laboratory Co., Ltd. (the \u201cEntity\u201d) that is not directly owned by us. We control and consolidate this Entity into our group consolidated results through a series of contractual arrangements. See \u201cItem 1, Business-Our Corporate Structure and History\u201d and \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nThe contractual arrangements we have in place are governed by PRC law. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations on these contractual agreements and it is possible that the PRC authorities may in the future find these arrangements unlawful. If these arrangements were to be deemed unlawful, the PRC authorities have broad discretion to penalize us, including:\n\u00b7 revoking the business and operating licenses of our PRC subsidiaries and affiliates;\n\u00b7 discontinuing or restricting our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 and affiliates\u2019 operations;\n\u00b7 imposing fines or confiscating the income of our PRC subsidiaries or affiliates;\n\u00b7 requiring us or our PRC subsidiaries and affiliates to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations; or\n\u00b7 taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our clinic examination business.\nFurthermore, we have no assurance that Jibin Zhang and Yunpeng Jiang, parties to these control agreements, will continue to cooperate with us and honor these control agreements. There is a risk that they will not always act in our best interests. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or dispute that may arise between them and us, we may have to take legal action to compel them to fulfill their contractual obligations and there is substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. It may be difficult for us to change our corporate structure or to bring claims against the Entity if they do not perform their obligations under these contractual arrangements.\nThe audit report included in this annual report is prepared by an auditor who is not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in this annual report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. Because our auditors are located in the People\u2019s Republic of China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB.\nInspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor\u2019s audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections.\nThe inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\nProceedings instituted by the SEC against five PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act.\nStarting in 2011 the Chinese affiliates of the \u2018\u2018big four\u2019\u2019 accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, were affected by a conflict between U.S. and Chinese law. Specifically, for certain U.S.-listed companies operating and audited in mainland China, the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, sought to obtain from the Chinese firms access to their audit work papers and related documents. The firms were, however, advised and directed that under Chinese law, they could not respond directly to the US regulators on those requests, and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in China had to be channeled through the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC.\nIn late 2012 this impasse led the SEC to commence administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against the Chinese accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. A first instance trial of the proceedings in July 2013 in the SEC\u2019s internal administrative court resulted in an adverse judgment against the firms. The administrative law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the SEC, although that proposed penalty did not take effect pending review by the Commissioners of the SEC. On February 6, 2015, before a review by the Commissioner had taken place, the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the settlement, the SEC accepts that future requests by the SEC for the production of documents will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms will receive matching Section 106 requests, and are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests, which in substance require them to facilitate production via the CSRC. If they fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. Remedies for any future noncompliance could include, as appropriate, an automatic six-month bar on a single firm\u2019s performance of certain audit work, commencement of a new proceeding against a firm, or in extreme cases the resumption of the current proceeding against all four firms.\nIn the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm was denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of our ordinary shares from the NYSE Global Market or deregistration from the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, and its value may be depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, and this volatility may continue. For instance, between July 1, 2008 and March 31, 2015, the price of our common stock, as reported on the NASDAQ on which our common stock has traded, ranged between $3.99 and $52.24. Though we believe this dramatic fluctuation resulted mainly from volatility in our earnings, which is attributable to various events including, but not limited to the melamine contamination incident, the prematurity event and the worldwide market disruption, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nIn addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our common stock may be highly volatile for specific business reasons. Factors such as variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flow, announcements of new investments, cooperation arrangements or acquisitions, and fluctuations in market prices for our products could cause the market price for our shares to change substantially. In addition, our stock price may be impacted by the performance, reputation, or stock prices of other Chinese companies that are listed in the U.S.\nSecurities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe trading market for our common stock will also be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, the market price for our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price for our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nFurthermore, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in our company at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.\nAlthough publicly traded, the trading market in our common stock has been substantially less liquid than the common stock of many companies quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and this low trading volume may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume of our common stock has generally been very low. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2015 was approximately 39,533 shares. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to them.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a change-of-control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7 our board of directors is divided into three classes, with approximately one-third of our directors elected each year;\n\u00b7 our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7 our stockholders must provide timely notice for any stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u00b7 we have adopted provisions that eliminate the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director, with certain exceptions; and\n\u00b7 our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.", "PERMNO": 91967, "SIC": 2020, "TIC": "SYUT"}
