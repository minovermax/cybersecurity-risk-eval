{"cik": "88790", "company": "INTRICON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks should be considered when evaluating the Company\u2019s business and any forward-looking statements made is this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. Any of the risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the Company\u2019s other SEC filings could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations for 2021 and beyond could be materially adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak and/or subsequent pandemics.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus has evolved into a global pandemic. COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, including North America, Asia and Europe. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts Intricon\u2019s future business, operating results and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, cannot be accurately predicted and may be beyond our control. We cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or subsequent pandemics, the efficacy or availability of vaccines, surges in infections or the severity of any variants, actions that may be taken by governments and businesses in response to the pandemic, or the impacts of the pandemic on healthcare systems. These impacts and associated responses of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to:\n\u25cfReduced revenues as a result of disruptions in our operations, supply chain or in demand by our customers, including our major customers.\n\u25cfReduced revenues or earnings may require us to perform impairment assessments of our long-lived assets, goodwill and other assets and result in charges to earnings;\n\u25cfDiminished ability, or inability, to complete clinical trials and other activities required to achieve regulatory clearing for our products under development due to lack of access to healthcare facilities, healthcare providers and patients;\n\u25cfPotential delays in the over-the-counter hearing aid regulations required to be promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration due to COVID-19 priorities, which delay will likely have an adverse impact on our hearing health business over the course of 2021 and beyond.\nThe duration of future disruptions to our customers and to our supply chain, and related financial impact to us, cannot be estimated at this time. If such disruptions continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on a small number of customers for a majority of our revenues. In fiscal year 2020, Medtronic, our largest customer accounted for approximately 63 percent of our net revenue. A significant decrease or delay in sales or loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of customers to develop and sell products that incorporate our products. No assurance can be given that our major customers will not experience financial, technical, regulatory or other difficulties or delays that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our results of operations.\nSeveral of our customers in the hearing health market have undergone mergers or acquisitions, resulting in a smaller customer base with larger customers. If the Company is unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with the current customer base, it may adversely affect our operating profits and revenue.\nWe have in the past and may in the future explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business. Acquisitions pose significant risks, including the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, the Company has in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions of other businesses or technologies that the Company believes could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines, diversify our revenue base, allow for geographic expansion or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding these opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for various reasons, including a failure to secure financing.\nOur prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions may result, in the recording of goodwill and intangible assets subject to potential impairment in the future if we are not able to realize the value paid, adversely affecting our operating results. For example, in 2017, we completed the acquisition of Hearing Help Express and in 2020 we completed the acquisition of EMS. We recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with this each of these acquisitions. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; unanticipated liabilities and litigation; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives or achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, the Company may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Future acquisitions also may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt.\nDownturns in the domestic economic environment could cause a severe disruption in our operations.\nAdverse changes in the economy could negatively affect our business, which could exacerbate many of the risk factors we have identified including, but not limited to, the following:\nLiquidity:\n\u25cfThe domestic economic environment, including credit markets, could worsen and reduce liquidity and this could have a negative impact on financial institutions and the country\u2019s financial system, which could, in turn, have a negative impact on the business of our customers and on our business.\n\u25cfInvestments held by the Company are subject to market conditions which could decline in value and reduce liquidity.\n\u25cfIf interest rates rise, this could disrupt domestic and world markets and could adversely affect the economy as a whole and our liquidity, costs of borrowing and results of operations.\nDemand:\n\u25cfAny downturn in the economy or a return to recession could result in lower sales to our customers. Additionally, our customers may not have access to sufficient cash or short-term credit to obtain our products or services.\nPrices:\n\u25cfIn the event of a downturn, certain markets could experience deflation, which would negatively impact our average prices and reduce our margins.\nOur failure, or the failure of our customers, to obtain required governmental approvals and maintain regulatory compliance for regulated products would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from those products.\nThe markets in which we and our customers operate are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. For medical devices sold and distributed in the United States by Intricon and our customers, the FDA regulates the design control, development, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping, and surveillance procedures.\n\u200e\nThe process of obtaining marketing clearance or approvals from the FDA for new products and new applications for existing products can be time-consuming and expensive, and there is no assurance that such clearance/approvals will be granted, or that the FDA review will not involve delays that would adversely affect our ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products. Some of our products in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre-market approval process with the FDA. The FDA has the authority to control the indicated uses of a device. Products can also be withdrawn from the market due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems. The FDA regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, with possible retroactive effect, will not adversely affect us.\nThe Company is in the process of preparing the Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software technology for submission to the FDA for approval. This technology is crucial to our development of the over-the-counter market for our hearing aids. Any delays in FDA approval could have an adverse impact on our entry into this market.\nThe registration system for our medical devices in the EU requires that our quality system conform to international quality standards. Manufacturing facilities and processes under which our hearing aid devices and OEM components and assemblies are produced, are inspected and audited by various certifying bodies. These audits verify our compliance with applicable requirements and standards. Further, the FDA, various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect our facilities to determine whether the Company is in compliance with various regulations relating to quality systems, such as manufacturing practices, validation, testing, quality control, product labeling and product surveillance. A determination that the Company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties, including fines, product recalls or product seizures, suspensions or shutdown of production and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions, depending on the nature of the violation.\nFurther, to the extent that any of our customers to whom we supply products become subject to regulatory actions or delays, our sales to those customers could be reduced, delayed or suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings.\nImplementation of our growth strategy may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase revenues.\nOur growth strategy includes developing new products and entering new markets, as well as identifying and integrating acquisitions. Our ability to compete in new markets will depend upon a number of factors including, among others:\n\u25cfability to stay competitive by developing quality products that are technologically advanced and inexpensive to manufacture;\n\u25cfour ability to create demand for products in new markets;\n\u25cfour ability to strengthen our sales and marketing presence;\n\u25cfour ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; and\n\u25cfour ability to fund growth.\nThe failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may face competition in these new markets from various companies that may have substantially greater research and development resources, marketing and financial resources, manufacturing capability and customer support organizations.\nOur need for continued investment in research and development may increase expenses and reduce our profitability.\nOur industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development. If we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development, our products could become less attractive to existing and potential customers and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of the need to maintain or increase spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development, our operating results could be materially harmed if our research and development efforts fail to result in new products or if revenues fall below expectations. In addition, as a result of our commitment to invest in research and development, management believes that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues could increase in the future.\n\u200e\nThe Company is subject to risks arising from its international sales and operations.\nWe derived approximately 27 percent of our 2020 revenues from customers located outside of the U.S. In 2020, we operated in Singapore, Indonesia, and Germany. Approximately 7 percent of our revenues were derived from our facilities in these countries in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 12 percent of our long-lived assets are located in these countries. Political or economic instability in foreign countries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to disruption of production or diminished revenues in these countries. Our future revenues, costs of operations and profit results could be affected by a number of factors related to our international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country's political condition, trade protection measures, licensing and other legal requirements and local tax issues. Unanticipated currency fluctuations in the Euro, Singapore dollar and other currencies could lead to lower reported consolidated revenues due to the translation of this currency into U.S. dollars when we consolidate our revenues and results from operations.\nThe Company is subject to tax legislation in numerous countries; changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is a global corporation with a presence in the United States, Singapore, Indonesia and Germany. As such, the Company is subject to tax laws, regulations and policies of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of comparable taxing authorities in other country jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, as well as other factors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates in 2020 and thereafter and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rates, tax payments, tax credits or incentives will not be adversely affected by these or other initiatives.\nOur success depends on our senior management team and the Company\u2019s ability to retain them as well as continued service of our engineering and technical personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team, including Scott Longval who was appointed in October 2020 as president and chief executive officer to replace Mark S. Gorder, who retired at the end of September 2020. We depend on the services of Mr. Longval and the other members of our senior management team to, among other things, continue the development and implementation of our business strategies and maintain and develop our client relationships. Certain members of our management team are approaching retirement and the Company must locate and employ suitable replacements from within or outside the Company. If we fail to successfully and timely attract and hire replacements for members of senior management as they retire with persons with the appropriate level of expertise, we could experience adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. Any significant leadership change and accompanying senior management transition, such as the recent change in our president and chief executive officer, and the hiring of other new leaders in key roles, involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance.\nWe do not maintain key-man life insurance for any members of our senior management team.\nThere is intense competition for qualified engineering and technical personnel in our markets. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development and growth of our business. The failure to retain and recruit key technical personnel could cause additional expense and potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by disruption at our sites or those of our major customers or suppliers.\nOur main headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area. In addition, we have manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Batam. We rely on these facilities to house our operations, manufacture our products and store finished goods. Severe weather, natural disasters and other calamities, such as pandemics (including COVID-19), earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes, fires and explosions, accidents, mechanical failures, unscheduled downtimes, civil unrest, strikes, transportation interruptions, unpermitted discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances, other environmental risks, sabotage or terrorist attacks, could severely disrupt our operations, or those of our major customers and suppliers. While the Company has taken steps to manage operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse, in whole or part, site disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any significant disruption to our sites for any reason also could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships.\n\u200e\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity\nWe and/or our customers may be unable to protect our and their proprietary technology and intellectual property rights or keep up with that of competitors.\nOur ability to compete effectively against other companies in our markets depends, in part, on our ability and the ability of our customers to protect our and their current and future proprietary technology under patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws. We cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate, or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around the proprietary rights we own or license. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in attempting to protect our proprietary rights.\nWe attempt to protect and maintain proprietary technology and intellectual property through confidentiality agreements and patents. Despite the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our and our customers\u2019 products, develop similar technology independently or otherwise obtain and use information that we or our customers regard as proprietary. The process of identifying and managing patent disputes is time consuming and costly. Accordingly, our ability or our customer\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage over competitors may be diminished.\nIf we become subject to material intellectual property infringement claims, we could incur significant expenses and could be prevented from selling specific products.\nWe may become subject to material claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others in the future. We cannot assure that, if made, these claims will not be successful. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim even if the claim is invalid and could distract management from other business. Any judgment against us could require substantial payment in damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain products.\nMoreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities, commonly referred to as \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. From time to time, we may receive threatening letters or notices or may be the subject of claims that our solutions and underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management's attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and cause us to incur significant expenses.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, insurance, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems and user training and education), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, loss of customers, litigation with customers and other parties, loss of trade secrets and other proprietary business data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Environmental Liabilities\nThe Company is subject to numerous asbestos-related lawsuits, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Company is a defendant along with a number of other parties in lawsuits alleging that plaintiffs have or may have contracted asbestos-related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos products or equipment containing asbestos sold by one or more named defendants. These lawsuits relate to the discontinued heat technologies segment which we sold in March 2005. Due to the non-informative nature of the complaints, we do not know whether any of the complaints state valid claims against us. Certain insurance carriers have informed us that the primary policies for the period August 1, 1970-1978 have been exhausted and that the carriers will no longer provide defense and insurance coverage under those policies. However, we have other primary and excess insurance policies that we believe afford coverage for later years. Some of these other primary insurers have accepted defense and insurance coverage for these suits, and some of them have either ignored our tender of defense of these cases, or have denied coverage, or have accepted the tenders but asserted a reservation of rights and/or advised us that they need to investigate further. Because settlement payments are applied to all years a litigant was deemed to have been exposed to asbestos, the Company believes we will have funds available for defense and insurance coverage under the non-exhausted primary and excess insurance policies. However, unlike the older policies, the more recent policies have deductible amounts for defense and settlements costs that we will be required to pay; accordingly, we expect that our litigation costs will increase in the future as the older policies are exhausted. Further, many of the policies covering later years (approximately 1984 and thereafter) have exclusions for any asbestos products or operations, and thus do not provide insurance coverage for asbestos-related lawsuits. If our insurance policies do not cover the costs and any awards for the asbestos-related lawsuits, we will have to use our cash or obtain additional financing to pay the asbestos-related obligations and settlement costs. There is no assurance that we will have the cash or be able to obtain additional financings on favorable terms to pay asbestos related obligations or settlements should they occur. The ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty. In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos lawsuits, there is no guarantee that these lawsuits will not materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we have $129 and $721 recorded within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, within our Consolidated Balance Sheet for estimated future claims. An insurance receivable of $129 and $721 is recorded within other current assets and other assets, net, respectively, within our Consolidated Balance Sheet for estimated insurance recoveries.\nEnvironmental liability and compliance obligations may affect our operations and results.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations as well as internal programs and policies governing:\n\u25cfair emissions;\n\u25cfwastewater discharges;\n\u25cfthe storage, use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and chemicals;\n\u25cfemployee health and safety;\nIf violations of environmental laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties, fines and remedial actions. Our operations and results could be adversely affected by any material obligations arising from existing laws, as well as any required material modifications arising from new regulations that may be enacted in the future. We may also be held liable for past disposal of hazardous substances generated by our business or former businesses or businesses we acquire. In addition, it is possible that we may be held liable for contamination discovered at our present or former facilities.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and there has been and could be limited trading volume in our stock.\nOver the last several years, stock markets in general, as well as the market price of our common stock, has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile and there has been limited trading volume in our stock. which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell common stock when they want to and at prices they find attractive. For example, our stock traded between a low sale price of $9.84 and a high sale price of $19.70 in 2020.\nOur common stock market price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\uf0b7operating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\uf0b7performance of the major end markets we target including regulatory or other delays affecting our or our customers\u2019 products;\n\uf0b7the timing and announcement of strategic developments, acquisition, or other material events by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7adverse or unfavorable publicity about our products, technologies or us;\n\uf0b7downgrades of our stock by securities analysts or other unfavorable commentary or research;\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\uf0b7changes in general market conditions, global financial markets, and global economies.\nThese broad fluctuations and limited trading volume may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and your ability to sell our common stock.\nMost of our outstanding shares are available for resale in the public market without restriction. The sale of a large number of these shares could adversely affect the share price and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or make acquisitions for common stock.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to shareholders.\nThe Company is a Pennsylvania corporation. Anti-takeover provisions in Pennsylvania law and our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if the Company is sold. For example, our charter provides that the board of directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. In addition, our bylaws provide for a classified board, with each board member serving a staggered three-year term. Directors may be removed by shareholders only with the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the trading price of our stock and our ability to retain our current customers or obtain new customers.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, referred to as Section 404, the Company is required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, reports of our management and our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting. While we have reported no \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we cannot guarantee that we will not have material weaknesses in the future. Compliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming. If in the future we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner, or if we determine that we have a material weakness, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, any failure to establish an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential investors and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\n\u200e", "PERMNO": 41574, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "IIN"}
