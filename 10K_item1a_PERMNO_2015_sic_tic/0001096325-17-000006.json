{"cik": "1096325", "company": "INTERSIL CORP/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors.\n\ufeff\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factors listed below. In addition to these risks, other risks not now known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business could be materially harmed and it could impact our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. If our business is harmed, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\n\ufeff\nAs discussed in \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d in Item 1 above, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements, including as a result of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our other filings with the SEC and in material incorporated by reference. We undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\ufeff\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with the Merger.\n\ufeff\nOn September 12, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Renesas. The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our stockholders, which we received on December 8, 2016, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. There is no assurance that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Additionally, if the Merger is not completed, we may suffer a number of consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and stock price. There are numerous risks related to the Merger, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u2022Various conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived;\n\u2022The Merger may not be consummated, which among other things may cause our share price to decline to the extent that the current price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed;\n\u2022The failure to consummate the Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community;\n\u2022Required regulatory approvals from governmental entities may delay the Merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could cause Renesas to abandon the Merger;\n\u2022Our ability to attract, recruit, retain, and motivate current and prospective employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022The attention of our employees and management may be diverted due to activities related to the Merger;\n\u2022Disruptions from the Merger, whether or not it is completed, may harm our relationships with our employees, customers, distributors, suppliers, or other business partners, and may result in a loss of or a substantial decrease in purchases by our customers; and\n\u2022The Merger Agreement restricts us from engaging in certain actions without Renesas\u2019 approval, which could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities outside the ordinary course of business that arise prior to the closing of the Merger.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\n\ufeff\nGlobal economic conditions and uncertainty, as well as the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, could adversely affect our revenue, operating results, cash flows, collectability of accounts receivable and supplier relationships, and our ability to access capital markets.\n\ufeff\nAdverse global economic conditions have, from time-to-time, caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the semiconductor industry generally, as well as in our specific end-markets, which has adversely affected our business and results of operations. In recent periods, market and business conditions in general have been adversely affected by investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook, including concerns about the rate of a global economic recovery. In addition, our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, in which significant uncertainty currently exists. These uncertainties pose risks to us because end-market customers and others may postpone spending in response to negative financial news, declines in overall consumer sentiment or spending, increased unemployment in the U.S. or abroad or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers, but also related to declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by significantly reduced customer demand, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Any future general economic or semiconductor industry downturn could materially and adversely affect our business from one period to the next relative to demand, product pricing, revenue and financial results. In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced periods of increased demand, during which we may experience internal and external manufacturing constraints, which could cause us to lose revenue opportunities and market share. We may experience substantial volatility in future operating results due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry.\n\ufeff\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources. Our competitors may also have longer-standing and more comprehensive relationships with suppliers and customers that gives them a marketplace advantage over us. The current level of competition in the semiconductor market is high and may increase in the future. We currently compete directly with companies that have developed similar products, including Analog Devices, Infineon Technologies, Linear Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, ON Semiconductor, and Texas Instruments. We also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions. These direct and indirect competitors are established, multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies. In addition, there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If these or future acquisitions are successful, competition may intensify, and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us. Our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving and increasingly more complex area of IC technology depends on several factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u2022success in designing and manufacturing new products that implement new technologies;\n\u2022ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees;\n\u2022protection of our proprietary products, processes, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022maintaining high product quality and reliability;\n\u2022pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022the relative performance of competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022ability to deliver in large volumes on a timely basis;\n\u2022marketing, manufacturing and distribution capability; and\n\u2022financial strength.\nTo the extent that our products achieve market success, competitors typically seek to offer competitive products and/or lower prices. Our failure to compete successfully, or our competitors\u2019 success in offering competitive products or lower prices, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to maintain or expand our business depends on the successful development and market acceptance of our new products.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles and continuous erosion of average selling prices. Consequently, our future success will be highly dependent upon our ability to continually develop new products using the latest and most cost-effective technologies, the general commercial availability of our products ahead of the competition and having our products selected for inclusion in the products of leading system manufacturers. The development of new products will continue to require significant R&D expenditures.\n\ufeff\nThe introduction of new products presents significant business challenges as product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of related revenues. The success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand, future technological developments and a variety of specific implementation factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u2022timely and efficient completion of process design and development;\n\u2022timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022our relative product performance;\n\u2022the quality and reliability of our product;\n\u2022effective marketing, sales and service; and\n\u2022customer acceptance of our products over those of our competitors.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute any of these elements of new product development, our market share could decline, we would not achieve the expected return on investment for our R&D expenditures and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nOur competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to achieve design wins for our products with current and future customers and introduce new or improved products that meet customer needs while achieving favorable margins. A failure to develop, produce and market products in a timely manner, or to achieve market acceptance for these products, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, such as reducing our revenue, decreasing our market share, increasing our costs, lowering our gross margin percentage, and possibly leading to impairment of assets.\n\ufeff\nThe end-markets we serve are characterized by rapid product obsolescence and require that our products be made commercially available within a specific market window. If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, or we are unable to deliver products in a timely manner, our financial condition and results may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nThe end-markets we serve are generally characterized by high volumes, short life cycles and rapidly changing market requirements, products and customer demand. Our success in these end-markets will depend principally on our ability to:\n\ufeff\n\u2022predict technology and market trends;\n\u2022develop products on a timely basis; and\n\u2022meet the market windows.\nIf we are unable to consistently perform the foregoing activities, we may not be able to sustain or grow our revenues. In addition, sudden changes in customer demand, order cancellations or delay in product shipments to end-market customers could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA downturn in the end-markets we serve could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results.\n\ufeff\nAny deterioration in the end-markets we serve or our inability to compete for new solutions within the end-markets we serve could lead to a reduction in demand for our products which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf our products contain defects or fail to achieve acceptable reliability standards, our reputation may be harmed, and we may incur significant unexpected expenses and lose sales opportunities. Our insurance coverage for such events may be insufficient.\n\ufeff\nSemiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that are not detected until after the product is introduced into the market. We generally warrant our products for one year from the date of shipment. If any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification obligations in our terms and conditions of sale. Our products may contain undetected errors or defects that may:\n\ufeff\n\u2022cause delays in our product introductions and shipments;\n\u2022result in increased costs and diversion of development resources;\n\u2022cause us to incur increased charges due to obsolete or unusable inventory;\n\u2022require design modifications; or\n\u2022decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products, resulting in product returns, recalls, harm to our reputation and lost sales.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, we may not identify defects or failures in a timely manner, which may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance and could significantly harm our operating results. Our current and potential customers might also seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products. Further, such claims might be significantly higher than the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved, as we are typically a component supplier with limited value content relative to the value of a complete system or sub-system. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages for which we may have insufficient insurance coverage. Any of these claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage our reputation and business.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on third-party suppliers, located around the world, for raw materials and services to manufacture our products, which can result in supply disruptions, sudden cost increases and delays beyond our control in delivering our products to customers.\n\ufeff\nProduction time and the cost of our products could increase and our results of operations could be adversely effected if we were to lose one or more of our suppliers or if one or more of those suppliers increased the prices of raw materials or if we were unable to obtain adequate raw materials in a timely manner. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis. We generally purchase raw materials, such as silicon wafers, from a limited number of suppliers on a just-in-time basis. From time-to-time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.\n\ufeff\nWe use both internal and third-party wafer fabrication facilities in manufacturing our products. We intend to continue to rely heavily on third-party suppliers for most of our manufacturing requirements. Most of these third-party suppliers are not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price. As a result, we cannot directly control delivery schedules, which could lead to product shortages, quality assurance issues and increases in the cost of our products. We may experience delays and cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain products within the timeframes or in the volumes required by us at an affordable cost, or at all. Any disruption in the availability of silicon wafers or other raw materials or any problems associated with the delivery, quality or cost of the fabrication, assembly and testing of our products could significantly hinder our ability to deliver our products to our customers and may result in a decrease in the sales of our products. If our third-party suppliers are unable to provide our products, we may be required to seek new suppliers and we cannot be certain that we will be able to locate and qualify new suppliers on favorable terms or that sufficient capacity will be available within a reasonable period of time.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the process to manufacture our products is highly complex and precise, requiring production in a highly controlled environment. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by a third-party supplier could adversely affect their ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. If our suppliers do not achieve adequate yields or product reliability, our customer relationships could suffer. This could ultimately lead to a loss of sales of our products and have a negative effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Additionally, our contract manufacturers may decide to discontinue operations at a particular location or altogether, which would cause us to transfer those manufacturing operations elsewhere, which would increase our costs, disrupt the supply of products and harm our financial results.\n\ufeff\nDelays in production at a new facility, in implementing new production techniques or in resolving issues associated with technical equipment malfunctions, may lower yields and reduce our revenues and profitability.\n\ufeff\nOur manufacturing processes are very complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously modified to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or other issues in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors, which would place us at a competitive and cost disadvantage relative to our competitors.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes. Resultant delays can be unpredictable and can result in late product deliveries and reduced yields. We may experience manufacturing issues in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Increases in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity may adversely affect our operating results if revenues do not increase proportionately.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProducts we manufacture and sell, or products formerly produced and sold by us and now manufactured and sold by purchasers of businesses that we have divested, may infringe other parties\u2019 intellectual property, or IP, rights. We may have to pay third parties damages for infringement and misappropriation of their IP rights, suspend the manufacture, use or sale of some the affected products, or incur the cost of defending litigation, resulting in significant expense to us.\n\ufeff\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of IP rights. We have received, and expect to receive in the future, notices of claims of infringement and misappropriation of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. In the event of an adverse decision in a patent, trademark, copyright, mask work or trade secret litigation matter, we could be required to withdraw the product or products found to be infringing from the market or be required to redesign such products. We have, at times, assumed indemnification obligations in favor of our customers that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. We have also, at times, assumed indemnification obligations in favor of the purchasers of businesses that we have divested that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights by us or those purchasers.\n\ufeff\nWhether or not these infringement claims are ultimately successful, we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention in the defense of these claims. To address any potential claims asserted against us or those we have indemnified, we may seek to obtain a license under a third-party\u2019s IP rights. However, in such an instance, a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and payments under such a license could increase our costs and reduce our margins. Litigation could result in significant expense to us, adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technology and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation, we may be required to:\n\ufeff\n\u2022pay significant attorneys\u2019 fees in the defense of any such claim;\n\u2022pay substantial damages, which may include enhanced damages for willful infringement and the other party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, which could be significant;\n\u2022indemnify our customers for damages they might suffer if the products they purchase from us infringe the IP rights of others;\n\u2022indemnify purchasers of businesses that we have divested for damages they might suffer if certain of the products they sell infringe the IP rights of others;\n\u2022stop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products;\n\u2022expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technology;\n\u2022discontinue the use of some processes; and/or\n\u2022obtain licenses to IP rights covering products and technology that may, or may have been found to, infringe or misappropriate such IP rights.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations or damage our reputation.\n\ufeff\nIf we, or our suppliers, suffer loss or significant damage to our factories, facilities or distribution systems due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\n\ufeff\nOur factories, facilities and distribution systems, and those of our suppliers, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake or other natural or man-made disasters. For example, our internal wafer fabrication facility is located on the east coast of Florida. Operations at this facility may experience disruptions and damage during tropical storms and hurricanes. Further, our corporate headquarters is located near major earthquake fault lines in California and we have been unable to obtain earthquake insurance at reasonable costs and limits. Some of our facilities and those of most of our suppliers are located in the Pacific Rim region known to have above average seismic and severe weather activity. Any catastrophic natural disaster in those regions or catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of our facilities or those of our suppliers would likely disrupt our operations, as well as delay production, shipments and revenue, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Such events could also result in significant expenses to repair or replace our affected facilities, and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe use a significant amount of IP in our business. If we are unable to protect this IP, we could lose our right to prevent others from using our key technologies, resulting in decreased revenues.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on IP rights to protect our technology. Our rights include, but not are limited to, rights existing under patent, trade secret, trademark, mask work and copyright law. Some of our technology is not covered by any patent or patent application, and there are risks that our patents may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.\n\ufeff\nCompetitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around our patents. In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright, mask work and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\n\ufeff\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary technology, including technology that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure that these agreements will always be undertaken or will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.\n\ufeff\nSome of the licenses we have to use third-party IP are time bound, and will expire, unless extended. Prior to expiration, we will be required to negotiate renewals of these agreements or obtain the IP from alternative sources. We may not be able to obtain alternative IP, or renewals on substantially similar terms as those that currently exist, or at all. Any failure to renew or obtain alternative licenses could cause us to cease offering certain products or features or expend resources to develop alternative technology, expose us to litigation and other IP claims and increase our costs, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe failure to protect our IP, to extend our existing license agreements or the inability to utilize alternative technology, could adversely affect our revenues.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and regulations related to the import and export of our products, including those regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\ufeff\nAs an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of our products, services and technologies from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, administered by the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, or DTCC, and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the ITAR, or represent so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items governed by the EAR. As a result, these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. Any failures to properly classify products or otherwise comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. Any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nIn September 2010, in response to a request for information, we disclosed to the DTCC information concerning export activities for the years 2005 through 2010 pursuant to the DTCC\u2019s authority under ITAR. In June of 2013, the DTCC notified us of potential violations of ITAR and that it was considering pursuing administrative proceedings against us. On June 16, 2014, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the DTCC for the purpose of resolving the potential violations of ITAR. Our agreement with the DTCC had a two-year term and provided for: (i) payment of an aggregate civil penalty of $10 million, $4 million of which is suspended and eligible for offset credit based on verified expenditures for certain past and future remedial compliance measures; (ii) the appointment of an internal Special Compliance Official to oversee compliance with the Agreement and U.S. export control regulations; (iii) two external audits of the Company\u2019s ITAR compliance program; and (iv) continued implementation of ongoing remedial compliance measures and additional remedial compliance measures related to automated systems and ITAR compliance policies, procedures, and training. The Consent Agreement period was closed on June 21, 2016.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are also subject to customs regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which control the import of technologies into the U.S. and various other aspects of the operation of our business. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, we can provide no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of our products or other activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to recruit and retain highly skilled personnel.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and financial personnel. Highly skilled employees are difficult to attract and retain in the highly competitive semiconductor industry, and the failure to attract and retain such personnel could negatively impact our ability to keep pace with our competitors. Further, we have in the past several years announced certain cost reductions that included reductions in our work force. These reductions in personnel, as well as any future cost reduction measures, could negatively impact morale, leading to unintended employee attrition and difficulty in recruiting personnel.\n\ufeff\nMost of our distributors and value-added resellers can terminate their contract with us with little or no notice. The termination by a distributor or value-added reseller could result in a materially negative impact on our business, including a negative impact to our revenue and accounts receivable.\n\ufeff\nIn 2016, our distributors accounted for 51.9% of our revenue. Our distributors can generally terminate their agreement with us with only minimal notice. One of our distributors accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. The termination of a significant distributor or value-added reseller could impact our revenue and limit our access to certain end-customers. It could also result in the return of excess inventory. Since many distributors simply resell our products, they generally operate on low profit margins. If a distributor or value-added reseller were to terminate their agreement with us or go out of business, our accounts receivable originating through that distributor or value-added reseller would be subject to significant collection risk.\n\ufeff\nAll of our distributors and value-added resellers carry competing product lines. Our sales would be adversely affected if our distributors or value-added resellers promoted competing products over our products for any reason, including the ability of the distributor or value-added reseller to earn a higher margin or other monetary incentive for doing so.\n\ufeff\nOur distribution channel partners have recently experienced consolidation due to merger and acquisition activity in that business sector. This consolidation may result in our distributors or resellers allocating fewer resources to the distribution and resale of our products, which could adversely affect our financial results. At times, our sales are concentrated in a small number of distributors or resellers, which are in various international locations and of various financial strengths. Financial difficulties, the inability to access capital markets, or other reasons may affect our distributors' or resellers\u2019 performance, which could materially harm our business and our operating results.\n\ufeff\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates, exposure to additional income tax liabilities or adverse outcomes resulting from the examination of our income or other tax returns.\n\ufeff\nAs a global company, our effective income tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate, as well as our actual taxes payable, could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Malaysia where we currently have a tax holiday resulting in a tax rate of 0%. This 10-year tax holiday began on July 1, 2009 and terminates on July 1, 2019. In order to maintain this tax holiday in Malaysia, we must meet certain operating conditions, including compliance with warehouse and shipping quotas and specified manufacturing activities in Malaysia. Absent such tax holiday, the corporate income tax rate in Malaysia that would otherwise apply to us would be 24%. If we cannot or elect not to comply with these conditions, we could lose the related tax benefits. In such event, we may be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy. Any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangement.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOn January 17, 2017, the Finance Act 2017, or Finance Act, became effective in Malaysia. The Finance Act provides for a withholding tax to be imposed on payments made by Malaysian entities to non-residents for certain services. Given the recent effective date of the Finance Act, it is unclear whether it will apply to payments made from our Malaysia subsidiary to non-residents, which could include intercompany payments to the parent corporation of our Malaysia subsidiary. We are currently assessing the applicability of the Finance Act to determine the potential impact to our consolidated financial results. If the Finance Act were to apply to intercompany payments made to non-resident entities, there could be a material increase to our income tax expense and a corresponding adverse effect on our financial results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other state and non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.\n\ufeff\nNon-U.S. sales accounted for 82.3% of our revenue in 2016. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant majority of our total revenue in future years. Our international operations and sales are subject to various risks including, but not limited to:\n\ufeff\n\u2022increases in taxes, tariffs and governmental royalties;\n\u2022changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;\n\u2022loss of revenue, equipment and property as a result of expropriation, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, boycotts, trade restrictions and other political risks;\n\u2022unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;\n\u2022currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022trade balance issues;\n\u2022differences in our ability to acquire and enforce our IP and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; and\n\u2022the need for technical support resources in different locations.\nMany of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a large and fast growing market for semiconductors and an area of additional and continued growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan, Japan, and the U.S., that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia/Pacific region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our future revenue and profits.\n\ufeff\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to on-going litigation risks and have recently been found liable for trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement.\n\ufeff\nFrom time-to-time, we are subject to legal claims, such as the litigation filed against us by Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions, Inc., or TAOS, in 2008. In that litigation matter, at the conclusion of the trial in early 2015, the jury found in favor of TAOS and recommended to the court that we pay over $59 million in damages for trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement. We estimated that the amount of the judgment, along with prejudgment interest and the legal fees we anticipated we would incur in the post-trial proceedings and during the appeal, would total $81.1 million. After certain post-trial motions were heard, the court entered a final judgment on June 9, 2016, and as a consequence, we increased our accrual for this matter by $1.3 million in the quarter ended July 1, 2016. Given the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation and because the outcome remains subject to appeal, the ultimate impact of this lawsuit may be materially different from our estimate.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are also involved in a variety of routine legal matters that arise in the normal course of our business. The outcome of any litigation matter would be inherently uncertain, unpredictable and expensive. An unfavorable resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\ufeff\nEnvironmental liabilities and other governmental regulatory matters could force us to expend significant capital and incur substantial costs.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to various environmental laws relating to the management, disposal, and remediation of hazardous materials and the discharge of pollutants into the environment. We are also subject to laws relating to workplace safety and worker health which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. The future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws (and liability for known environmental conditions ) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict:\n\ufeff\n\u2022what environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future;\n\u2022how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered, or interpreted;\n\u2022the amount of future expenditures which may be required to comply with these environmental or health and safety laws or to respond to future cleanup matters or other environmental claims; or\n\u2022the extent of our obligations to the purchasers of our environmentally challenged sites.\nThomson Consumer Electronics Television Taiwan, Ltd., or TCETVT, notified us in September of 2015, that it reserved its right to seek indemnification from us for any and all costs, fees, and expenses it incurs as a result of a toxic tort class action lawsuit filed in Taiwan against TCETVT and others, plus the cost of site remediation. The lawsuit pertains to alleged injuries resulting from groundwater contamination at a manufacturing facility in Taiwan currently owned by TCETVT, which was previously owned and operated by predecessors (including General Electric and Harris Corporation) of our Taiwan subsidiary, Intersil Ltd. TCETVT has informed us that a judgment of $18.5 million has been entered against TCETVT and that it has incurred costs of $11.2 million in defending the lawsuit and $15.9 million in site remediation costs. We were advised by TCETVT that additional claimants may be added to the lawsuit and TCETVT believes that if such additional claimants were successfully added, the resulting liability could be as high as $200.0 million. By letter dated June 22, 2016 from counsel for General Electric and by letter dated July 14, 2016 from counsel for TCETVT, we were advised that in April 2016 the Taiwan Supreme Court denied the request to add additional claimants to the existing lawsuit and that, in response to the denial, the plaintiffs filed a new, but related lawsuit, claiming damages on behalf of 1,147 new claimants as well as adding additional sites at which the toxic torts were alleged to have occurred, such that the resulting liability could be as high as an additional $225.0 million. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. If we were ultimately found to be liable for a liability of this magnitude, it would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Although Harris Corporation has agreed to indemnify us for all environmental liabilities related to events or activities occurring before our acquisition of their semiconductor business, Harris has not yet agreed to indemnify us for the liability asserted by TCETVT. In addition, while we believe that Harris currently maintains sufficient assets to cover any indemnification obligation they may have, there can be no assurance that Harris will have such assets at the time a claim may be made by us.\n\ufeff\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe may acquire or invest in businesses, applications or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target.\n\ufeff\nIn any future acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our future acquired businesses due to a number of factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u2022inability to integrate or benefit from acquisitions in a profitable manner;\n\u2022unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022incurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022difficulty converting the clients of the acquired business to our solution and contract terms, including disparities in the revenues, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties and additional costs and expenses associated with supporting legacy products;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022harm to our existing relationships with our partners and customers as a result of an acquisition;\n\u2022the loss of our or the acquired business\u2019s key employees;\n\u2022diversion of resources that could have been more effectively deployed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the use of our available cash, or the incurrence of debt, which could harm our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\n\ufeff\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d have resulted in additional expenses to us, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\n\ufeff\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC, or adjoining countries. There were and continue to be costs associated with complying with these rules, includes costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. In addition, the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of such minerals. For example, there may only be a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict-free\u201d materials, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary \u201cconflict-free\u201d materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation, could increase our costs, and could adversely affect our manufacturing operations. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as free of conflict minerals.\n\ufeff\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our own employees. Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of supplies, sales or customers and cause us to incur significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems, or the information technology systems of our suppliers or customers over which we have little or no control over, could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRestrictions in our revolving credit facility may limit our activities.\n\ufeff\nOur current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions that limit our ability to engage in certain activities including our ability to enter into certain transactions, make investments or other specified restricted payments, pay certain dividends, repurchase our capital stock, create certain liens on our assets, and incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. These covenants could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, respond to changing business and economic conditions or engage in other transactions or business activities that may be important to our growth strategy or otherwise important to us. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, and changes in the level of competition. If we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness, if any, could be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders under our credit facility could institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets used to secure the borrowing under such facility.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 87612, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ISIL"}
