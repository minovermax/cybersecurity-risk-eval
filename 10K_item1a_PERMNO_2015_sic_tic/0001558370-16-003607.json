{"cik": "315709", "company": "INTERNATIONAL BANCSHARES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. Described below are the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect the Company. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties the Company describes below and the other information in this Annual Report or incorporated by reference before deciding to invest in, or retain, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not know about or that the Company currently believes are immaterial, or that the Company has not predicted, may also harm the Company\u2019s business operations or adversely affect the Company. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity could be materially harmed. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nLosses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance the Company establishes for that purpose, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company\u2019s lending activities. Losses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance the Company establishes for that purpose. Like all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for probable loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for probable loan losses reflects management\u2019s best estimate of loan losses in the loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of the specific credit risks, the Company\u2019s historical loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, composition and growth of the loan portfolio, and economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for probable loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. As a result, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future provisions for loan losses may adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company believes its allowance for probable loan losses is adequate at December 31, 2015.\nIf real estate values in the Company\u2019s target markets decline, the loan portfolio would be impaired.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate located in the markets served by the Company. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by, among other things, changes in national, regional, or local economic conditions; fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchases, changes in the tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations, and policies; and acts of nature. If real estate prices decline significantly in any of these markets, the value of the real estate collateral securing the Company\u2019s loans would be reduced. Such a reduction in the value of the Company\u2019s collateral could increase the number of impaired loans and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s subsidiary banks face strong competition in their market areas, which may limit their asset growth and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s primary market areas are South, Central and Southeast Texas, including Austin and Houston, and the State of Oklahoma. The banking business in these areas is extremely competitive, and the level of competition facing the Company may increase further, which may limit the growth and profitability of the Company. Each of the Company\u2019s subsidiary banks experience competition in both lending and attracting funds from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions and non-bank financial institutions located within its market area, many of which are significantly larger institutions. Non-bank competitors competing for deposits and deposit type accounts include mortgage bankers and brokers, finance companies, credit unions, securities firms, money market funds, life insurance companies, and mutual funds. For loans, the Company encounters competition from other banks, savings associations, finance companies, mortgage bankers and brokers, insurance companies, small loan and credit card companies, credit unions, pension trusts, and securities firms. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Company offers. Also, technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of revenue streams and the reduction of lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies, in part, on external financing to fund the Company\u2019s operations and the unavailability of such funds in the future could adversely impact the Company\u2019s growth strategy and prospects.\nThe Company relies on deposits, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of Dallas and other borrowings to fund its operations. The unavailability of such funds in the future could adversely impact the Company\u2019s growth strategy, prospects and performance. The subsidiary banks have also historically relied on certificates of deposit. While the Company has reduced its reliance on certificates of deposit and has been successful in promoting its transaction and non-transaction deposit products (demand deposit accounts, money market, savings and checking), jumbo deposits nevertheless constituted a large portion of total deposits at December 31, 2015. Jumbo deposits tend to be a more volatile source of funding. Although management has historically been able to replace such deposits on maturity if desired, no assurance can be given that the Company would be able to replace such funds at any given point in time. The IRS rule that extends the reporting requirements for interest on deposits to nonresident alien individuals that applies to interest payments made on or after January 1, 2013, may result in deposit withdrawals by nonresident alien individuals who were not previously subject to the reporting requirements, including residents of Mexico.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company is unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nInflation;\n\u00b7\nRecession;\n\u00b7\nChanges in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits;\n\u00b7\nA rise in unemployment;\n\u00b7\nTightening of the money supply; and\n\u00b7\nDomestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce the Company\u2019s profits. The Company expects that the bank subsidiaries will continue to realize income from the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Earnings could be adversely affected if the net interest spreads are reduced. Changes in interest rates and other factors could result in write downs of carrying values of securities held in our securities available-for-sale portfolio and such changes could reduce earnings of the Company.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect the Company including, without limitation, changes in U.S.-Mexico trade and travel along the Texas border, increased costs related to healthcare reform and other labor developments and possible enforcement and other legal actions.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of the Company\u2019s operations. Because the Company\u2019s business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that there will be no laws, rules or regulations adopted in the future, or changes in accounting policies and practices, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive, or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or prospects. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Healthcare reform and other labor developments are expected to increase labor costs of the Company. These changes and other changes to statutes and regulations, including changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any reductions in border crossings and commerce resulting from the Homeland Security Programs called \u201cUS-VISIT,\u201d which is derived from Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 could affect the Company negatively, and any possible negative consequences from an adverse immigration law could also have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s potential future acquisitions and branch expansion could be adversely affected by a number of factors.\nAcquisitions of other financial institutions and branch expansion have been a key element of the Company\u2019s growth. There are a number of factors that may impact the ability of the Company to continue to grow through acquisition transactions, including strong competition from other financial institutions who are active or potential acquirers of financial institutions in the existing or future markets of the Company. Acquisitions of other financial institutions and new branches must be approved by bank regulators and such approvals are dependent on many factors, including the results of regulatory examinations and CRA ratings.\nThe Company relies heavily on its chief executive officer.\nThe Company has experienced substantial growth in assets and deposits during the past, particularly since Dennis E. Nixon became President of the Company in 1979. Although Mr. Nixon is the chief executive officer and one of the Company\u2019s substantial shareholders, the Company does not have an employment agreement with Mr. Nixon and the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, including as a result of a cyber-attack, could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure our Company uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems, including cybersecurity risks. Our products and services involve the gathering, storage and transition of sensitive information regarding our customers and their accounts. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our customers. In addition, we must be able to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us against physical damage, security breaches and service disruption caused by the Internet or other users. Cyber-security attacks, computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us. While the Company conducts its own data processing, it is reliant on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations of the Company. As a financial institution we are also subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations and guidance, as well as our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs. If our information systems or infrastructure experience a significant disruption or breach, it could lead to unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of our customers in our possession and unauthorized access to our proprietary information, methodologies and business secrets. In addition, if our partners, vendors or other market participants experience a disruption or breach, it could lead to unauthorized transactions on Company or Company customer accounts or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information maintained by those entities. A disruption or breach such as these could result in significant legal, financial and non-financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, damage to our reputation and loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services that could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company may desire or need to raise additional capital or increase liquidity levels in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all and the ability of the Company to increase liquidity levels may be limited.\nThe Company may desire or need to raise additional capital or increase liquidity levels in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if its asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and the Company\u2019s financial performance. The Company cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investor. The impact of the regulatory liquidity proposal may result in a shortfall of high-quality liquid assets. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed or the unavailability of high-quality liquid assets could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThere are restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to both receive and pay dividends.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock only receive dividends as the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may declare out of legally available funds. Although the Company has historically declared cash dividends on its common stock, it is not required to do so and there can be no assurance that the Company will pay dividends in the future.\nThe Company is a financial holding company engaged in the business of managing, controlling and operating its subsidiaries, including its subsidiary banks. The Company receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Company\u2019s subsidiaries may pay to the Company. The inability to receive dividends from the Company\u2019s subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill could negatively impact our earnings and capital.\nGoodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Given the current economic environment and conditions in the financial markets, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to our normal annual assessment if we experience disruption in our business, unexpected significant declines in our operating results, or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future, which would be recorded as charges against earnings. The decrease in earnings resulting from impairment charges could also negatively impact other performance measures; however, for regulatory purposes, goodwill is eliminated in calculating the Company\u2019s regulatory ratios such as its regulatory capital ratios. We performed an annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, 2015. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired. Depending on the response of the financial industry to the legal, regulatory and competitive changes related to interchange fees, overdraft services and interest on demand deposit accounts, financial institutions may need to change their policies, procedures and operating plans in the future to compete more effectively and such changes may require certain financial institutions to take a goodwill impairment charge to account for anticipated reduction in revenue related to such changes.\nThe Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may be subject the Company to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact\nthe successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and Europe\u2019s ongoing debt crisis could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nStandard and Poor\u2019s lowered the U.S. long term sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA+ on August 5, 2011. The downgrade and a further downgrade or a downgrade by other ratings agencies of the U.S. government\u2019s sovereign credit rating, or its perceived creditworthiness, could adversely affect the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. Many of our investment securities are issued by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities (\u201cGSEs\u201d). The rating downgrade could affect the stability of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs. These factors could affect the liquidity or valuation of our current portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs, and could result in our counterparties requiring additional collateral for our borrowings and could increase our borrowing costs. Because of the unprecedented nature of any negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impact on global markets and our business, financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent; however, any adverse impact related to the downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, concerns about the European Union\u2019s sovereign debt crisis have also caused uncertainty for financial markets globally. Such risks could indirectly affect the Company by affecting the Company\u2019s customers with European businesses or assets denominated in the euro or companies in the Company\u2019s market with European businesses or affiliates.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting tools and models.\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate its probable loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical tools and forecasting models. These tools and models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the tools or models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting tools or models could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by declining crude oil prices.\nThe recent decisions by certain members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to maintain higher crude oil production levels have led to increased global oil supplies which has resulted in significant declines in market oil prices. Decreased market oil prices have compressed margins for many U.S. and Texas-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. Energy production and related industries represent a large part of the economies in some of the Company\u2019s primary markets. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Texas and Oklahoma. Accordingly, a prolonged period of low oil prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nChanges in economic and political conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings, as our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans decline.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic and political conditions, local, national and international with respect to Mexico, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, changes in capital markets, money supply, political issues, legislative and\nregulatory changes, a decline in oil prices, and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely affect the Company\u2019s asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company is particularly affected by conditions in its primary market areas of South, Central and Southeast Texas, including Austin and Houston, and the State of Oklahoma. If economic conditions in the Company\u2019s primary market areas continue to weaken or worsen due to the recent decline in oil prices or other factors or fail to improve or to continue to improve, the Company could experience an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties as well as the soundness of other financial institutions with which the Company interacts.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, financial institutions or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information or problems with the soundness of other financial institutions with which the Company interacts could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company does not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers and its ability to stay abreast of technological innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost-effective basis.\nIn addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, the Company\u2019s competitors also include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, specialty finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. Such changes in the financial industry may result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the costs of new technology, including personnel, can be high in both absolute and relative terms. There can be no assurance, given the fast pace of change and innovation, that the Company\u2019s technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet or continue to meet the needs of the Company and the needs of our customers.\nThe recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the Company\u2019s interest expense.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, beginning on July 21, 2011, financial institutions were allowed to commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients and the Company does have such a program. The Company\u2019s interest expense may increase and its net interest margin may decrease if it begins paying interest on a significant amount of demand deposits in order to attract additional customers or maintain current customers, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Regulatory Reform Act and other regulatory developments could negatively impact the revenue streams of the Company related to interchange fees and consumer services and result in a contraction of retail banking of the Company.\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act authorizes the Federal Reserve to regulate interchange fees paid to banks on debit card transactions to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing individual transactions, and prohibits debit card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network. The impact of the FDIC Overdraft Payment Supervisory Guidance could jeopardize the profitability of a number of retail sites of the Company and could result in a reduction of revenue from the Company\u2019s overdraft courtesy services. The Reform Act created the CFPB. While banks with less than $10 billion in assets, such as each of the subsidiary banks of the Company, are exempt from the primary examination, and enforcement powers of the CFPB, the new agency\u2019s rulemaking will affect all banks. The impact of the CFPB is uncertain at this time, but the initiatives of the CFPB could negatively impact revenue streams of the Company related to consumer services. The reduction of revenue from retail banking services coupled with the repeal of the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, could result in a contraction of retail banking of the Company. The Company closed fifty-five in-store branches during the fourth quarter of 2011 due to reduced levels of revenue resulting from regulatory changes limiting interchange fees in order to align the Company\u2019s expenses with the reduced levels of revenue.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Company, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support the Company\u2019s day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, and distracting to management. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against the Company, the Company could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe limitation of preemption in the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, the powers of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the FDIC Overdraft Payment Supervisory Guidance may increase the likelihood of lawsuits against financial institutions, and increased costs related to such lawsuits if the CFPB restricts the use of arbitration and/or class action waivers in consumer banking contracts.\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act provides that courts must make preemption determinations on a case-by-case basis with the respect to particular state laws and can no longer rely on blanket preemption determinations. The new CFPB is specifically authorized to protect consumers from \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cdeceptive,\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d acts and practices. Depending on the future actions of the CFPB, the likelihood of lawsuits against financial institutions related to allegedly \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d acts and practices could increase. The Company\u2019s costs related to such lawsuits would be significantly increased if the CFPB restricts the use of arbitration and/or class action waivers in consumer banking contracts based on the results of the CFPB\u2019s study of such matters that were published during the fourth quarter of 2013.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Stock\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may be volatile.\nSeveral factors could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include among other things:\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated variations in earnings;\n\u00b7\nRecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s announcements of developments related to its businesses;\n\u00b7\nOperating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;\n\u00b7\nNew technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors;\n\u00b7\nContinued low trading volume in the Company\u2019s stock;\n\u00b7\nThe volatile impact of short selling activity in the Company\u2019s stock;\n\u00b7\nNews reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry; and\n\u00b7\nChanges in the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nChanges in government regulations, policies and guidance.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to the Company\u2019s performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of its common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nThe holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $161 million in junior subordinated debentures outstanding that were issued to our statutory trusts. The trusts purchased the junior subordinated debentures from us using the proceeds from the sale of trust preferred securities to third party investors. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by us to the extent not paid or made by each trust, provided the trust has funds available for such obligations.\nThe junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock and the Senior Preferred Stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock or preferred stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our shareholders. If certain conditions are met, we have the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) at any time or from time to time for a period not to exceed up to 20 consecutive quarters in a deferral period, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock or preferred stock.\nRisks Related to Participation in the CPP\nWe may be adversely affected by our participation in the CPP.\nIn connection with our sale of Senior Preferred Stock to the Treasury Department under the Capital Purchase Program, the Company also issued to the Treasury Department a warrant to purchase 1,326,238 shares of our common stock (the \u201cWarrants\u201d). While the Company exited the TARP program when it repurchased all of the remaining Senior Preferred Stock on November 28, 2012, the Warrants remain outstanding and were sold by the U.S. Treasury to a third party on June 12, 2013. The dilutive impact of the Warrants may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. The Warrant expires on December 23, 2018.", "PERMNO": 85875, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "IBOC"}
