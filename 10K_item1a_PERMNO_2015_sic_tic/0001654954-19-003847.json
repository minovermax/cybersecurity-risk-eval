{"cik": "1579823", "company": "New Age Beverages Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risk factors that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If any significant adverse developments resulting from these risk factors should occur, the trading price of our securities could decline, and moreover, investors in our securities could lose all or part of their investment in our securities.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nRisks Related to our Business, Operations, and Industry\nWe have incurred losses to date and may continue to incur losses.\nWe have incurred net losses since we commenced operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our net losses were $12.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $22.6 million as of December 31, 2018. These losses have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, assets, and stockholders\u2019 equity. In order to achieve and sustain such revenue growth in the future, we must significantly expand our market presence and revenues from existing and new customers. We may continue to incur losses in the future and may never generate revenues sufficient to become profitable or to sustain profitability. Continuing losses may impair our ability to raise the additional capital required to continue and expand our operations.\nIn connection with our combination with Morinda, we potentially owe the former Morinda shareholders up to $15 million in cash or registered stock (plus interest) based on Morinda standalone 2019 results.\nIn connection with the Morinda combination, the Company issued 43,804 shares of Series D Preferred Stock providing for the potential payment of up to $15 million to the former Morinda shareholders contingent upon Morinda achieving certain post-closing milestones. The holders of the preferred stock will be entitled to receive a dividend of up to an aggregate of $15 million (the \u201cMilestone Dividend\u201d) if the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda standalone is at least $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Milestone Dividend is payable on April 15, 2020 (the \u201cDividend Payment Date\u201d). If the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda standalone is less than $20 million, the Milestone Dividend will be adjusted downward based on applying a five-times multiple to the difference between the Adjusted EBITDA of $20 million and actual Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company is required to pay an annual dividend to the holders of the Preferred Stock equal to an aggregate of 1.5% of the Milestone Dividend amount, payable on a pro rata basis. The Company may pay the Milestone Dividend and/or the annual dividend in cash or in kind, provided that if the Company chooses to pay in kind, the shares of common stock issued as payment therefore must be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The Preferred Stock will terminate on the Dividend Payment Date.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory \u201csay-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last date of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Exchange Act. We will be deemed a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000, measured on January 1.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nGrowth of operations will depend on the acceptance of our products and consumer discretionary spending.\nThe acceptance of our healthy beverage products by both retailers to gain distribution and by consumers to include in the beverage consumption repertoire is critically important to our success. Shifts in retailer priorities and shifts in user preferences away from our products, our inability to develop effective healthy beverage products that appeal to both retailers and consumers, or changes in our products that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business. Also, our success depends toa significant extent on discretionary user spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience an inability to generate revenue during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty, where users may decide to purchase beverage products that are cheaper or to forego purchasing any type of healthy beverage products, due to a lack of available capital. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that the products that we offer will become, or continue to be, appealing and as a result there may not be any demand for these products and our sales could decrease, which would result in a loss of revenue. Additionally, there is no guarantee that interest in our products will continue, which could adversely affect our business and revenues.\nDemand for products which we sell depends on many factors, including the number of customers we are able to attract and retain over time, the competitive environment in the healthy beverage industry, as well as the beverage industry as a whole, may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending, and ability to anticipate changes in user preferences and to meet consumer\u2019s needs in a timely cost effective manner all could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for the products we plan to offer, which could adversely affect our sales, cash flows and overall financial condition. An investor could lose his or her entire investment as a result.\nWe have limited management resources and are dependent on key executives.\nWe are currently relying on key individuals to continue our business and operations and, in particular, the professional expertise and services of Mr. Brent Willis, Chief Executive Officer, as well as key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. In addition, our future success depends in large part on the continued service of Mr. Willis. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Willis, but the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee retention ofMr. Willis and we may not be able to retain Mr. Willis for the duration of or beyond the end of his term. If our officers and directors chose not to serve or if they are unable to perform their duties, and we are unable to retain a replacement qualified individual or individuals, this could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and operating results if we are unable to replace the current officers and directors with other qualified individuals.\nThe healthy beverage and lifestyle industry requires the attraction and retention of talented employees.\nSuccess in the beverage industry, specifically as it relates to our healthy functional beverage products, does and will continue to require the acquisition and retention of highly talented and experienced individuals. Due to the growth in the market segment targeted, such individuals and the talent and experience they possess is in high demand. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and maintain access to such individuals. If we fail to attract, train, motivate, and retain talented personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted, which could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our operating results could be harmed. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Based on our evaluations, our management concluded that there were no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Failure to comply with Section 404(a) could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nCompetition that we face is varied and strong.\nOur products and industry as a whole are subject to competition. There is no guarantee that we can develop or sustain a market position or expand our business. We anticipate that the intensity of competition in the future will increase.\nWe compete with a number of entities in providing products to our customers. Such competitor entities include: (1) a variety of large multinational corporations engaged in the beverage and healthy beverage industries, including but not limited to companies that have established loyal customer bases over several decades; (2) healthy beverage companies that have an established customer base, and have the same or a similar business plan as we do and may be looking to expand nationwide; (3) a variety of other local and national healthy beverage companies with which we either currently or may, in the future, compete; and (4) multinational corporations in the direct selling business that have a large, loyal independent distributor bases.\nMany of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and greater name and brand recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with both existing and potential customers. They also may be able to offer more products and more aggressively promote and sell their products. Our competitors may also be able to support more aggressive pricing than we will be able to, which could adversely affect sales, cause us to decrease our prices to remain competitive, or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit earned on our products.\nIn our direct-to-consumer business, we sell our products to a network of active IPCs and Customers. If we are unable to attract and retain active IPCs and Customers, our business may be harmed.\nWe distribute our Tahitian Noni,TruAge, and TeMana products through approximately 300,000 independent contractor IPCs, and we depend upon them directly for a substantial amount of our sales. To increase our revenue, we must increase the number of, and the productivity of, our IPCs. Thus, our success in this segment depends in part upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a large base of IPCs. We cannot accurately predict how the number and productivity of our IPCs may fluctuate, because we are relying primarily on our IPC leaders to recruit, train, and motivate new IPCs. Several related factors affect retention and motivation, including general business and economic conditions, adverse publicity, investigations or legal proceedings, government regulations or actions, public perceptions about dietary supplement products, and other competing direct-to-consumer companies that are larger than us and compete fiercely for a limited number of persons who desire to become independent distributors.\nIn our direct-to-consumer business, Tahitian Noni Juice and MAX constitute a significant portion of our sales.\nTahitian Noni Juice and MAX constitute a significant portion of our Morinda business unit sales, accounting for 85%, 85%, and 87% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We face a high degree of competition from other companies producing noni and other superfruit products. If consumer demand for these products declines significantly or our competition is more successful in the markets in which we do business, then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers of raw and packaging materials.\nWe rely upon a limited number of suppliers for raw and packaging materials used to make and package our products. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to successfully secure such materials from suppliers that are delivered with consistency and at a quality that meets our requirements. The price and availability of these materials are subject to market conditions. Increases in the price of our products due to the increase in the cost of raw materials could have a negative effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw and packaging materials, delays or reductions in product shipments could occur which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The supply and price of raw materials used to produce our products can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as frosts, droughts, other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growing decisions, various plant diseases and pests, transportation interruption and foreign imposed restrictions. If any of the foregoing were to occur, no assurance can be given that such condition would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our results of operations are dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our requirements of raw materials. Any failure by us to accurately forecast our demand for raw materials could result in an inability to meet higher than anticipated demand for products or producing excess inventory, either of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn our direct-to-consumer business, all the noni we use is grown and harvested exclusively in French Polynesia. Noni fruit is the most important raw material used in our Tahitian Noni and TeMana products, and it is important to the success of our Company. If the government of French Polynesia were to prohibit the exportation or use of noni, or, if we were unable to source noni fruit in French Polynesia in sufficient quantities to meet demand for our products due to adverse weather, natural disasters, soil overuse, labor shortages, or any other reason, our financial condition and results would be harmed. Any adverse publicity regarding the quality of noni grown in French Polynesia would also have an adverse impact on our results and financial condition.\nWe depend heavily on our processing plant in Mataiea, Tahiti.\nOur processing plant in Mataiea, Tahiti produces all the noni puree used in our Tahitian Noni Juice, MAX, and many other noni-based products. Noni puree is sent to our Company-owned and contracted manufacturing facilities in American Fork, Utah, Japan, Germany, and China. As a result, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our processing plant in Mataiea, Tahiti. The Tahiti operation is subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, labor strikes, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA. The occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales.\nFood and beverage retailers across all channels in the U.S. and other markets have been consolidating, increasing margin demands of brand suppliers, and increasing their own private brand offerings, resulting in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If we and our distributor partners do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer. Certain retailers make up an important percentage of our products\u2019 retail volume, including volume sold by our distributor partners. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. The loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe depend on third party manufacturers for a portion of our business.\nWhile we own or control manufacturing facilities in French Polynesia, Utah, and China, a portion of our sales revenue is dependent on third party manufacturers that we do not control. The majority of these manufacturers\u2019 business comes from producing and/or selling either their own products or our competitors\u2019 products. As independent companies, these manufacturers make their own business decisions. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they manufacture our products, our competitors\u2019 products and their own products. They may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands. In most cases, they are able to terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us without cause. We may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them. Their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control, and our business could suffer as a result. Deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third-party manufacturers. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nFailure of third-party distributors upon which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on third party distributors for the sale of our RTD products to retailers. The loss of a significant distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our distributors may also provide distribution services to competing brands, as well as larger, national or international brands, and may be to varying degrees influenced by their continued business relationships with other larger beverage, and specifically, healthy beverage companies. Our independent distributors may be influenced by a large competitor if they rely on that competitor for a significant portion of their sales. There can be no assurance that our distributors will continue to effectively market and distribute our products. The loss of any distributor or the inability to replace a poorly performing distributor in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will successfully attract new distributors as they increase their presence in their existing markets or expand into new markets.\nWe may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries, some of which are rapidly changing or at times conflicting. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations, could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on our beverages and our ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products, such as California\u2019s \u201cProp 65,\u201d which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to our products.\nOur IPCs could violate marketing or advertising laws or regulations.\nIn our direct-to-consumer business, we sell through IPCs. Each IPC signs an agreement with Morinda, agreeing to comply with all our policies and procedures, including without limitation our Policy Manual. Our policies prohibit false and misleading advertising and the making of improper health and income claims. We require IPCs to clear all promotional materials in advance with our Compliance Department. However, despite our efforts, from time to time, IPCs violate our policies and publish inappropriate marketing materials describing our products or programs. It is impossible to monitor all social media outlets and all IPC communications. Our Compliance Department takes commercially reasonable means, including a computer program that actively searches for improper advertising, to find improper IPC advertising-and when we find such advertising, we require the IPC to correct it. Some such promotional communications have lingered for years in obscure places on the internet and, by the time we find them, the IPC is no longer affiliated with us and is not cooperative in removing the offending advertising. These violations by IPCs could lead to actions against us by regulatory agencies, states\u2019 attorney generals, and private parties and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operational results.\nOur proposed Cannabidiol (CBD) product line is subject to varying, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions.\nWe have announced the launch of a new product line consisting of CBD-infused beverages. Our intention is to commercialize the new line as soon as regulations and laws permit in different jurisdictions in markets worldwide. The cannabis industry is evolving and subject to varying, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions. For example, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removes hemp from the Controlled Substances Act and permits the production and marketing of hemp and derivatives of cannabis with less than 0.3 percent concentrations of THC. However, in a statement from Scott Gottlieb, FDA Commissioner, the Commissioner reemphasized its agency 's authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act.\nThe Company does not intend to distribute and commercialize its CBD product line in the U.S. until it believes it can do so in conformity with applicable laws. Although the demand for our products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions develop, we cannot reasonably predict the nature of such developments or the effect, if any, that such developments could have on our business.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to commercialize our CBD Infused beverages.\nIf our CBD-infused beverages are to be subject to an extended approval process to comply with the FD&C Act, we may not be able to commercialize our CBD-infused beverages or may have to delay commercialization for an extended period of time. CBD products will also be subject to registration and/or approval in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company does business. It is uncertain how a delay in commercializing our CBD products would impact our Company.\nOur ongoing investment in new product lines and products and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new product lines, products, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe face various operating hazards that could result in the reduction of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by beverage companies that manufacture and distribute water, tea, energy drink, and dietary supplement products, such as defective products, contaminated products, and damaged products. The occurrence of such a problem could result in a costly product recall and serious damage to our reputation for product quality, as well as potential lawsuits. Although we maintain insurance against certain risks under various general liability and product liability insurance policies, no assurance can be given that our insurance will be adequate to fully cover any incidents of product contamination or injuries resulting from our operations and our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain insurance with adequate coverage for liabilities or risks arising from our business operations on acceptable terms. Even if the insurance is adequate, insurance premiums could increase significantly which could result in higher costs to us.\nSubstantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.\nA disruption in production at our beverage manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers, bottlers, or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation or supply interruption, government regulation, cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more, or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to seasonality related to sales of our products.\nOur business is subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. Historically, a significant portion of our net sales and net earnings has been realized during the period from May through September. Accordingly, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of any other results. If for any reason our sales were to be substantially below seasonal norms, our annual revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nLitigation and publicity concerning product quality, health, and other issues could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from product defects or product contamination. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging customers from buying our products. We could also incur significant liabilities, if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us, or litigation costs, regardless of the result. Further, any litigation may distract our key employees of cause them to expend resources and time normally devoted to the operations of our business.\nWe have experienced significant growth resulting in changes to our organization and structure, which if not effectively managed, could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur headcount and operations have grown substantially in recent years. We increased the number of full-time employees from 172 as of December 31, 2017 to 889 as of December 31, 2018. We believe that our corporate culture has been a critical component of our success. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and nurturing our culture. As we expand our business and operate as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our employee growth. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth and related organizational changes in a manner that preserves our culture could negatively impact future growth and achievement of our business objectives.\nIn addition, our organizational structure has become more complex as a result of our significant growth. We have added employees and may need to continue to scale and adapt our operational, financial, and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit additional financial, operational, and management resources before our revenue increases and without any assurances that our revenue will increase. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we likely will be unable to successfully execute our business strategy, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited\nWe have incurred net operating losses for US income tax purposes during our history. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change, \u201c generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, (and other pre-change tax attributes as applicable) to offset its post change income may be limited. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future and/or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, if we generate net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL\u2019s and other tax attributes. We plan to perform an IRC Section 382 analysis to determine if there are currently any limitations on the future use of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nBecause of our combination with Morinda and because our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to consumers outside the United States, our business is susceptible to risks associated with global operations.\nWith the Morinda combination, we now have subsidiaries in 25 countries and sales in 60 countries. This provides access to international markets for our traditional New Age product line. Still, our current global operations and future initiatives involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in regulatory requirements, taxes, currency control laws, or trade laws;\n\u25cf\nmore stringent regulations relating to data security (e.g., the GDPR in Europe), such as where and how data can be housed, accessed, and used, and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;\n\u25cf\ndiffering labor regulations, especially in countries and geographies where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n\u25cf\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs;\n\u25cf\nincreased travel, real estate, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with global operations;\n\u25cf\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we choose to do so in the future;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u25cf\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;\n\u25cf\nlimited or insufficient intellectual property protection;\n\u25cf\npolitical instability or terrorist activities;\n\u25cf\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and\n\u25cf\nadverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nIf we are not able to successfully address the above risks that may arise in connection with a global business, our financial condition and business result will be adversely affected.\nEconomic uncertainties or downturns in the general economy could disproportionately affect the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our results of operations.\nGeneral worldwide economic conditions have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, and market volatility and uncertainty remain widespread. Furthermore, during challenging economic times, our distribution customers may face issues with their cash flows and in gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us and adversely affect our revenue. If such conditions occur, we may be required to increase our allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, and our results of operations would be harmed. An economic turndown could, also, decrease demand for our nutritional supplement products that are on the higher end of the price range. The economic conditions in the U.S. and the various countries in which we do business also impact foreign exchange rates. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery, whether global, regional or within specific markets. If the conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen, our business could be harmed. In addition, even if the overall economy improves, the market for our products and services may not experience growth.\nIf we fail to enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that the development of our trade names and various brands are critical to achieving widespread awareness of our products, and as a result, is important to attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable products at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.\nAs a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions worldwide with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. Many aspects of the Tax Act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.\nThe amount of taxes we pay in jurisdictions in which we operate could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest, and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2018, we completed a business combination with Morinda, an entity much larger than our business before this acquisition. We previously acquired other businesses and product lines. We believe convergence with Morinda and these other businesses have been and continue to be successful. We may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses and product lines that we believe could complement or expand our product offerings, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not the acquisitions are completed. If we acquire businesses, we may not be able to integrate successfully the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target or obtain adequate financing to complete such acquisitions. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf our security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or cease their use of our services, our reputation may be harmed, and we may incur significant liabilities. Further, we are subject to governmental and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nOur business sometimes involve access to, processing, sharing, using, storage, and the transmission of proprietary information and protected data of our customers. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as other processes, to provide security for accessing, processing, sharing, using, storage, and transmission of such information. If our security measures are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials, or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business and our customers may be harmed, and we could incur significant liabilities. In particular, cyberattacks, phishing attacks, and other internet-based activity continue to increase in frequency and in magnitude generally, and these threats are being driven by a variety of sources, including nation-state sponsored espionage and hacking activities, industrial espionage, organized crime, sophisticated organizations, and hacking groups and individuals. In addition, if the security measures of our customers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches on us, our products and services, or our systems. We may also be responsible for repairing any damage caused to our customers\u2019 systems that we support, and we may not be able to make such repairs in a timely manner or at all. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brands become more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 proprietary and protected data.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises experienced by our customers, by our competitors, or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, or subject us to third party lawsuits, government investigations, regulatory fines, or other action or liability, all or any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure which, if any, cyber related claims made against us would be covered by our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, whether this coverage or any additional coverage the Company seeks will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any particular or future claim. The successful assertion of one or more claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of substantial deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to numerous jurisdictions worldwide regarding the accessing, processing, sharing, using, storing, transmitting, disclosure and protection of personal data, the scope of which are constantly changing, subject to differing interpretation, and may be inconsistent between countries or in conflict with other laws, legal obligations or industry standards. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and became effective in May 2018, adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for non-compliance. We have made a concerted effort to comply with the GDPR and also generally comply with industry standards and strive to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection, but it is possible that these laws and legal obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with industry standards or our practices. Compliance with such laws and other legal obligations may be costly and may require us to modify our business practices, which could adversely affect our business and profitability. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws, policies or other obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions or litigation against us, potential fines, and other expenses related to such governmental actions, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with global laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various global governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations.\nIn certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, and may result in our inability to provide certain products and services to prospective clients or clients. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, or if clients made claims against us for compensation, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees and costs. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur China business accounts for a significant part of our revenue and anticipated growth. Any decline in sales in China would harm our business results, as would any adverse regulatory action. Repatriation of profits from China may not be ensured.\nOur operations in China are conducted by Morinda\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Tahitian Noni Beverages (China) Company Limited (\u201cTNI China\u201d). TNI China received a coveted direct selling license from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in 2015. Our China sales have been growing at a robust, double-digit rate for the past several years, making China Morinda\u2019s second largest market. If we are not able to continue to grow sales through our TNI China business, it will have an adverse impact on our global results.\nChina is a large and vibrant market but doing business in China requires navigation of a difficult regulatory environment. China has published regulations governing direct selling-and a number of administrative methods and proclamations have been issued. These regulations require TNI China to use a business model different from the one Morinda offers in other markets. For TNI China to operate under these regulations, we have created and implemented a model specifically for China. However, it cannot be ensured that interpretations of direct selling laws will not adversely affect our business in China or lead to fines against us or our IPCs.\nIt can take one to three years to obtain product registrations in China. The lengthy process for obtaining product registrations often prevents us from launching new product initiatives in China on the same timelines as other markets around the world.\nChinese regulations prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in China. We cannot guarantee that any of our IPCs that do not have a China presence or any of IPCs or wholesalers in China have not engaged or will not engage in activities that violate our policies in this market, or that violate Chinese law or other applicable law, and therefore result in regulatory action and adverse publicity.\nOur operations in China are subject to risks and uncertainties related to general economic, political, and legal developments in China. For example, as a result of negative media coverage about the healthcare-related product claims made by a competitor in the direct selling industry in China, the government has recently increased its scrutiny of activities within the healthcare market, including direct selling. The Chinese government exercises significant control over the Chinese economy, including but not limited to controlling capital investments, allocating resources, setting monetary policy, controlling foreign exchange and monitoring foreign exchange rates, implementing and overseeing tax regulations, providing preferential treatment to certain industry segments or companies, and issuing necessary licenses to conduct business. Accordingly, any adverse change in the Chinese economy, the Chinese legal system, or Chinese governmental, economic, or other policies could have a material adverse effect on our business in China and our prospects generally.\nOver the past several years, the Company has been able to receive periodic license fees and annual dividends from TNI China. However, there is no guarantee this will continue, and any change in government policy affecting payment of license fees or repatriation of profits could harm the results and financial performance of the Company and reduce the Company\u2019s access to cash resources.\nLimits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our IPCs in certain countries could harm our business and cause regulatory risks.\nCertain markets, including China, Korea, Indonesia, and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay our IPCs. For example, in Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35% of our total revenue in Korea. These regulations may inhibit persons from becoming IPCs or cause interested persons to join competitors that are not focused on compliance. We have had to modify our compensation plan in certain markets to be in compliance. It is difficult to keep compensation within limits and we may, therefore, be at risk of violating limits even as we are trying to act in accordance with the regulations. It is not always clear which revenues and expenses are within the scope of regulations. Any failure to keep sales compensation within legal limits in the above and other markets could result in fines or other sanctions, including suspensions.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nWe rely heavily on our network infrastructure and information technology systems for our business operations. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of online attack, earthquake, fire, terrorist attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in accessing our service, reputational harm, loss of critical data or could prevent us from providing our products and services to our clients. In addition, some of our employee groups reside in areas particularly susceptible to earthquakes, such as Utah and Japan, and a major earthquake or other catastrophic event could affect our employees, who may not be able to access our systems or otherwise continue to provide our services to our customers. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers, or our network infrastructure or information technology systems, or access to our systems, could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe may be unable to meet the obligations of various financial covenants that are contained in our loan agreement with our senior lender, East West Bank.\nOur loan agreement with East West Bank impose various obligations and financial covenants on the Company. The loan facility has a variable interest rate and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the loan agreement imposes various financial covenants on the Company including maintaining a prescribed fixed charge coverage ratio, minimum adjusted EBITDA, minimum net cash and total leverage ratio. In addition the loan agreement limits the Company\u2019s ability to dispose of all or any part of its business or property; merge or consolidate with or into any other business organization; incur or prepay additional indebtedness; declare or pay any dividend or make a distribution on any class of our stock; or enter into specified material transactions with its affiliates. Accordingly, an adverse change in our financial performance would make it more difficult to meet our financial covenants.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect and enforce our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining trademark protection, patent protection, and trade secret protection of our products and brands, as well as successfully defending that intellectual property against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our intellectual property related to our trademarks, patents, and brands to the extent that we have obtained rights under valid and enforceable trademarks, patents, or trade secrets that cover our products and brands. Changes in either the trademark and patent laws or in interpretations of trademark and patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our issued trademarks or our issued patents. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time we may face intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or invalidity/non-infringement claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect us negatively. For example, werea third party to succeed on an infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, we could face an injunction, barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license agreement which may not be under acceptable, commercially reasonable, or practical terms or we may be precluded from obtaining a license at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. In the case of diagnostic tests, we would also need to include non-infringing technologies which would require us to re-validate our tests. Any such re-validation, in addition to being costly and time consuming, may be unsuccessful.\nFinally, we may initiate claims to assert or defend our own intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business and negatively affect our operating results or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that we, our employees, and independent contractors (including IPCs) do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we, our employees, or independent contractors have used or disclosed intellectual property in violation of others\u2019 rights. These claims may cover a range of matters, such as challenges to our trademarks, as well as claims that our employees or independent contractors are using trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee\u2019s former employer or independent contractors. As a result, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Corporate Governance\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and adversely affected by several factors.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to integrate operations, products, and services;\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\noperating results below expectations;\n\u25cf\nlitigation regarding product contamination;\n\u25cf\nour issuance of additional securities, including debt or equity or a combination thereof, which will be necessary to fund our operating expenses;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new or similar products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nloss of any strategic relationship, including raw material provider or distributor relationships;\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf\nchanges in foreign exchange rates;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nchanges in legal, regulatory, and enforcement frameworks impacting our products;\n\u25cf\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments, or strategic alliances;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nthe level and changes in our year-over-year revenue growth rate;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of securities analysts to publish research about us, or shortfalls in our results of operations compared to levels forecast by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nany delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq due to any failure to meet listing requirements;\n\u25cf\neconomic and other external factors; and\n\u25cf\nthe general state of the securities market.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the performance of particular companies.\nOur stock price has in the past and may in the future fluctuate based on developments in the cannabis industry.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated in response to developments in the cannabis industry and has experienced price swings in tandem with industry leaders in the cannabis market. As such, we have experienced fluctuations in the market price of our stock unrelated to the financial performance of our core business. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations based on developments and changes in the cannabis industry. Such fluctuations may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the most recently publicly-traded price or the price per share paid by existing investors, and investors purchasing our shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share at this time.\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of our common shares.\nSecurities research analysts may establish and publish their own periodic projections for us. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline. If no analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and volume for our common shares could be adversely affected.\nWe have not and may never pay dividends to shareholders.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion, and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nThe declaration, payment, and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our commonstock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below The NASDAQ Capital Market minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market listing requirements.", "PERMNO": 16593, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "NBEV"}
