{"cik": "1051514", "company": "STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-10-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements as discussed on page 1. Our business routinely encounters and addresses risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate.\nWe have incurred losses for a number of years, and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nFrom 1999 to 2015 we devoted substantially all of our resources to research, development and commercialization of MelaFind and primarily financed our operations through the sale of our equity securities. Since 2015 we have devoted substantially all of our resources in the commercialization and sales of the XTRAC products. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018, was approximately $4.0 million, and as of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $210.8 million. Our losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018, combined with the anticipated revenues from the sale of our products and the May 2018 Equity Financing, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next 12 months following the filing of this Report. In our debt modification with MidCap, MidCap reduced the restrictive covenants. However, if we fail to meet the monthly revenue covenants per the MidCap loan agreement, fail to timely provide financial information or incur another event of default, we may be declared in breach of the credit facility agreement and Midcap will have the option to call the loan balance.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets, including preclinical, clinical or commercial stage products or product candidates, or businesses, or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have limited experience with acquiring other companies, products or product candidates, and limited experience with forming strategic alliances and collaborations. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable strategic alliances or collaboration partners or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\n- 11 -\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or equity securities as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nDue to the delayed filing with the Commission of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities and may be delisted by NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), which may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nAs a result of the delayed filing with the Commission of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for one year, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to file all such reports in a timely manner in the future. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of additional securities to the public, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our business, strategic plan and financial condition. Furthermore, if we were to experience delays in making our future periodic filings with the Commission, it could subject us to delisting of our common stock from trading on Nasdaq. The delisting of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of and hinder our stockholders' ability to trade in our common stock, and could also affect our ability to access the capital markets or complete acquisitions. If our shares of common stock were delisted, there could be no assurance of it again being listed for trading on Nasdaq or any other exchange.\nIf we fail to abide by the terms and conditions of the MidCap Credit Facility, the secured lenders have the right to proceed against our intellectual property and other assets pursuant to their first priority security interest.\nOn December 30, 2015, we entered into a $12.0 million credit facility pursuant to a Credit and Security Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) and related financing documents with MidCap Financial Trust (\u201cMidCap\u201d) and the lenders listed in the loan documents. As of December 31, 2018, we had $7.6 million outstanding with this credit facility. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets. Our commitments under the Agreement require that we maintain our listing on a nationally recognized stock exchange and that we meet certain rolling 12-month revenue milestones. On April 30, July 15, August 26, and October 15, 2019, we received waivers from Midcap as administrative agent for the lenders who are party to the Agreement, wherein the lenders waived our events of default and compliance with the obligation to deliver audited financial statements within 120 days of our year-end pursuant to the Agreement. Waivers provided are effective through November 7, 2019. Our failure to abide by our on-going obligations under the loan documents could result in the lender seizing our assets.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses, joint ventures and other partnerships into our operations or achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions.\nIf we cannot successfully integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and other partnerships on a timely basis, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and our expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies, may not be achieved. Acquisitions involve substantial risks, including:\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services, accounting and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties related to entering geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to obtaining sufficient equity or debt financing; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of customers.\n- 12 -\nIn addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 interests would be diluted, which, in turn, could adversely impact the market price of our stock. Moreover, we could finance an acquisition with debt, resulting in higher leverage and interest costs and could increase losses and losses per share which could impact the price of our stock.\nOur laser treatments of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis and leukoderma and any of our future products or services may fail to gain market acceptance, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe have generated limited worldwide commercial distribution for our products. In the United States, our XTRAC systems are placed at physician offices at no upfront charge to the physician and we are paid on a per-usage method where we retain ownership of the system. We cannot assure you that our products and services will find sufficient acceptance in the marketplace under our sales strategies.\nWe also face a risk that other companies in the market for dermatological products and services may be able to provide dermatologists a higher overall financial return and therefore compromise our ability to increase our installed base of users and ensure they engage in optimal usage of our products. If, for example, such other companies have products (such as Botox or topical creams for disease management) that require less time commitment from the dermatologist and yield an attractive return on a dermatologist\u2019s time and investment, we may find that our efforts to increase our base of users are hindered.\nWe also face a risk that the overall cost of systemic or medications or treatment modalities become less expensive through the development of generics or other means. We may find the pressure to reduce our costs to be competitive which may negatively impact our business.\nCPT codes for all procedures are subject to continued reevaluation. Should CMS reduce reimbursement for the CPT codes for XTRAC treatment or raise reimbursement for competitive products we may see a decline in our recurring revenue business as well as a decline in new XTRAC installations.\nWhether a treatment may be delegated to non-physician staff members and, if so, to whom and to what extent, are matters that may vary state by state, as these matters are within the province of the state medical boards. In states that may be more restrictive in such delegation, a physician may decline to adopt the XTRAC system into his or her practice, deeming it to be fraught with too many constraints and finding other outlets for the physician\u2019s time and staff\u2019s time to be more remunerative. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in persuading such medical boards that a liberal standard for delegation is appropriate for the XTRAC system, based on its design for ease and safety of use. If we are not successful, we may find that even if a geographic region has wide insurance reimbursement, the region\u2019s physicians may decline to adopt the XTRAC system into their practices.\nWe therefore cannot assure you that the marketplace will be receptive to our excimer laser technology over competing products, services and therapies or that a cure will not be found for the underlying diseases we are focused on treating. Failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our products depends on third-party reimbursement of patients' costs, which could result in potentially reduced prices or reduced demand and adversely affect our revenues and business operations.\nOur ability to market our products successfully, especially XTRAC treatments, depends in large part on the extent to which various third parties are willing to reimburse patients or providers for the costs of medical procedures utilizing such products. These third parties include government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, whose patterns of reimbursement may change as a result of new standards for reimbursement determined by these third parties or because of the programs and policies enacted under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cACA.\u201d For the most part, aesthetic and cosmetic treatments for many of the approved usages of STRATAPEN are not covered by insurance and patients pay out of pocket for these treatments.\nThird-party payers are systematically challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. They may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payer, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Further, although third parties may approve reimbursement, such approvals may be under terms and conditions that discourage use of the XTRAC system. Accordingly, if less costly drugs or other treatments are available, third-party payers may not authorize or may limit reimbursement for the use of our products, even if our products are safer or more effective than the alternatives.\n- 13 -\nIn addition, medical insurance policies and treatment coverage have been and may be affected by the parameters of the ACA or successor policies enacted by the new administration. While the ACA's stated purpose is to expand access to coverage, it also mandates certain requirements regarding the types and limitations of insurance coverage. There can be no guarantee that the changes in coverage under the ACA will not affect the type and level of reimbursement for our products.\nAlthough we have received reimbursement approvals from a majority of private healthcare plans for the XTRAC system, we cannot give assurance that these private plans will continue to adopt or maintain favorable reimbursement policies or accept the XTRAC system in its clinical role as a second-line therapy in the treatment of psoriasis. Additionally, third-party payers may require further clinical studies or changes to our pricing structure and revenue model before authorizing or continuing reimbursement.\nAs of March 22, 2019, we estimate, based on published coverage policies and on payment practices of private and Medicare insurance plans, that more than 90% of the insured population in the U.S. is covered by insurance coverage or payment policies that reimburse physicians for using the XTRAC system for treatment of psoriasis. We can give no assurance that health insurers will not adversely modify their reimbursement policies for the use of the XTRAC system in the future.\nThe continuing development of our products depends upon our developing and maintaining strong working relationships with physicians.\nThe research, development, marketing and sale of our current products and any potential new and improved products or future product indications for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval depend upon our maintaining working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. At the same time, companies in the medical device industry are under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, and the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ for improper relationships with physicians. Our failure to comply with requirements governing the industry\u2019s relationships with physicians, including the reporting of certain payments to physicians under the National Physician Payment Transparency Program (Open Payments) or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG or the DOJ, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure in our customer education efforts could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.\nIt is important to the success of our marketing efforts to educate physicians and technicians how to properly use our products. We rely on physicians to spend their time and money to participate in our pre-installation educational sessions. Moreover, if physicians and technicians use our products improperly, they may have unsatisfactory patient outcomes or, in the case of the XTRAC system, cause patient injury, which may give rise to negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, revenues and profitability.\nIf revenue from a significant customer declines, we may have difficulty replacing the lost revenue, which would negatively affect our results and operations.\nIn our international business, we depend for a material portion of our sales in the international arena on several key sub-distributors, and especially on GlobalMed, which is our master distributor for our XTRAC and VTRAC products. If we lose GlobalMed or one of these sub-distributors, our sales of phototherapy products are likely to suffer in the short term, which could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.\nIf we fail to manage our sales and marketing force or to market and distribute our products effectively, we may experience diminished revenues and profits.\n- 14 -\nThere are significant risks involved in managing our sales and marketing force and marketing our products, including our ability:\n\u2022\nto hire, as needed, a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel with the aptitude, skills and understanding to market our products;\n\u2022\nto adequately train our sales and marketing force in the use and benefits of all our products and services, thereby making them more effective promoters;\n\u2022\nto manage our sales and marketing force and our ancillary channels (e.g., telesales) such that variable and semi-fixed expenses grow at a lesser rate than our revenues; and\n\u2022\nto set the prices and other terms and conditions for treatments using the XTRAC system in a complex legal environment so that treatments will be accepted as attractive skin health and appropriate alternatives to conventional modalities and treatments.\nTo increase acceptance and utilization of our products, we may expand our sales and marketing programs in the U.S. While we may be able to draw on currently available personnel within our organization to meet this need, we also expect that we will have to increase the number of representatives devoted to the sales and marketing programs and to broaden, through such representatives, the talents we have at our disposal. In some cases, we may look outside our organization for assistance in marketing our products.\nWe are not the manufacturer of some of our products and sell those products through contractual agreements.\nOur STRATAPEN products are purchased by us and resold to end users under a license agreement. In order to retain those lines, we need to achieve certain minimum sales. We cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve a level of sales required to maintain the rights to sell those products.\nWe are reliant on a limited number of suppliers for production of our products.\nProduction of our products requires specific component parts obtained from our suppliers. While we believe that we could find alternate suppliers, in the event that our current suppliers fail to meet our needs, a change in suppliers or any significant delay in our ability to have access to such resources could have a material adverse effect on our delivery schedules, business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, in the event we can no longer utilize this supplier or acquire this resource and must identify a new supplier or substitute a different resource, such change may trigger an obligation for us to comply with additional FDA regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, premarketing authorization and Quality System Requirements (\u201cQSR\u201d).\nOur failure to respond to rapid changes in technology and our applications in the medical devices industry or the development of a cure for skin conditions treated by our products could make our treatment system obsolete.\nThe medical device industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. To be successful, we must respond to new developments in technology, new applications of existing technology and new treatment methods. Our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we fail to be responsive on a timely and effective basis to competitors' new devices, applications, treatments or price strategies. For example, the development of a cure for psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis or leukoderma would eliminate the need for our XTRAC system for these diseases and would require us to focus on other uses of our technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nAs we develop new products or improve our existing products, we may accelerate the economic obsolescence of the existing, unimproved products and their components. The obsolete products and related components may have little to no resale value, leading to an increase in the reserves we have against our inventory. Likewise, there is a risk that the new products or improved existing products may not achieve market acceptance and therefore may also lead to an increase in the reserves against our inventory.\nOn March 13, 2017, we notified the FDA that, as of September 30, 2017, we will no longer service the MelaFind device. As the device is subject to both FDA requirements and requirements of certain foreign countries in which the device is still in use, we cannot assure you that a government agency may not make a demand that we either continue to provide support or recall devices still in use and thereby increase our costs and expenses.\n- 15 -\nOur customers, or physicians and technicians, as the case may be, may misuse certain of our products, and product liability lawsuits and other damages imposed on us may exceed our insurance coverage, or we may be subject to claims that are not covered by insurance.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the marketing and sale of our products. For example, we may be sued if our products cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claim may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or breach of warranty. Our products are highly complex and some are used to treat delicate skin conditions on and near a patient's face. In addition, the clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of certain of our products and procedures may also expose us to product liability, FDA regulatory and/or legal actions, or other claims. If a physician elects to apply an off-label use and the use leads to injury, we may be involved in costly litigation. In addition, the fact that we train technicians whom we do not supervise in the use of our XTRAC system during patient treatment may expose us to third-party claims if we are accused of providing inadequate training. We may also be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to the actions of others or the pre-existing health of the patient. For example, we rely on physicians in connection with the use of our products on patients. If these physicians are not properly trained or are negligent, the capabilities and safety features of our products may be diminished or the patient may suffer critical injury. We may also be subject to claims that are caused by the actions of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and sub-assemblies.\nWe presently maintain liability insurance with coverage limits of at least $5.0 million per occurrence and overall aggregate, which we believe is an adequate level of product liability insurance, but product liability insurance is expensive and we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us, if at all. Our insurance policy contains various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. A successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. In addition, continuing insurance coverage may also not be available at an acceptable cost, if at all. Therefore, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy a liability that may arise. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product, harm to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, initiation of investigations by regulators, costs to defend the related litigation, diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources, monetary awards to trial participants or patients, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions, exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources, a resulting decline in the price of our common stock and loss of revenues. As a result, regardless of whether we are insured, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could result in the FDA taking legal or regulatory enforcement action against us and/or our products including recall, and could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with complex statutes prohibiting fraud and abuse, and both we and physicians utilizing our products could be subject to significant penalties for noncompliance.\nThere are extensive federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal and civil penalties. These federal laws include:\n\u2022\nthe anti-kickback statute which prohibits certain business practices and relationships, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other federal healthcare programs, as modified by the ACA;\n\u2022\nthe physician self-referral prohibition, commonly referred to as the Stark Law;\n\u2022\nthe anti-inducement law, which prohibits providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program; the Civil False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and\n\u2022\nthe Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes HHS to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts. Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, and imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both.\n- 16 -\nAs federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation and enforcement efforts to root out waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large part to amendments to the Civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. An investigation into the use of our products by physicians may dissuade physicians from either purchasing or using our products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nWhile we do not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, many healthcare laws and regulations apply to our business. For example, we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare programs\u2019 anti-kickback laws, as modified by the ACA, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase order or recommendation of, any item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services not provided as claimed and which may apply to entities like us to the extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which established new federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, as well as leading to regulations imposing certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe medical device industry has been under heightened scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and regulatory or legal enforcement actions involving manufacturers who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business, including arrangements with physician consultants. If our operations or arrangements are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of us being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against that action and the underlying alleged violations, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on our business.\n- 17 -\nIf the effectiveness and safety of our devices are not supported by long-term data, and the level of acceptance of our products by dermatologists does not increase or is not maintained, our revenues could decline.\nOur products may not be accepted in the market if we do not produce clinical data supported by the independent efforts of clinicians. We received clearance from the FDA for the use of the XTRAC system to treat psoriasis based upon our study of a limited number of patients. Safety and efficacy data presented to the FDA for the XTRAC system was based on studies on these patients. For the treatment of vitiligo, atopic dermatitis and leukoderma, we have received clearance from the FDA for the use of the XTRAC system based primarily on a showing of substantial equivalence to other previously cleared predicate devices. However, we may discover that physicians will expect clinical data on such treatments with the XTRAC system. We also may find that data from longer-term psoriasis patient follow-up studies may be inconsistent with those indicated by our relatively short-term data. If longer-term patient studies or clinical experience indicate that treatment with the XTRAC system does not provide patients with sustained benefits or that treatment with our product is less effective or less safe than our current data suggests, our revenues could decline. In addition, the FDA could then bring legal or regulatory enforcement actions against us and/or our products including, but not limited to, recalls or requirements for premarket 510(k) authorizations. We can give no assurance that our data will be substantiated in studies involving more patients. In such a case, we may never achieve significant revenues or profitability.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain necessary FDA clearances or approvals, or equivalents thereof in the U.S. and relevant foreign markets, could hurt our ability to distribute and market our products.\nIn both our U.S. and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal, state or local levels in the U.S. and at analogous levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including, but not limited to, the FDA and the FTC, State Attorneys General in the U.S., as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold. If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net sales. Our failure to comply with federal or state regulations, or with regulations in foreign markets that cover our product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of its products. Further, our businesses are subject to laws governing our accounting, tax and import and export activities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in legal and/or financial consequences that might adversely affect our sales and profitability. Each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must first receive either 510(k) clearance or PMA from the FDA unless an exemption applies. Either process can be lengthy and expensive. The FDA's 510(k) clearance process may take from three to twelve months, or longer, and may or may not require human clinical data. The PMA process is much more costly and lengthy. It may take from eleven months to three years, or even longer, and will likely require significant supporting human clinical data. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearances for our XTRAC system for use in treating psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis and leukoderma, these approvals and clearances may be subject to revocation if post-marketing data demonstrates safety issues or lack of effectiveness.\nMany medical devices, such as medical lasers, are also regulated by the FDA as \u201celectronic products.\u201d In general, manufacturers and marketers of \u201celectronic products\u201d are subject to certain FDA regulatory requirements intended to ensure the radiological safety of the products. These requirements include, but are not limited to, filing certain reports with the FDA about the products and defects/safety issues related to the products as well as complying with radiological performance standards.\n- 18 -\nThe medical device industry is now experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Companies in our industry are subject to more frequent and more intensive reviews and investigations, often involving the marketing, business practices, and product quality management. Such reviews and investigations may result in civil and criminal proceedings; the imposition of substantial fines and penalties; the receipt of warning letters, untitled letters, demands for recalls or the seizure of our products; the requirement to enter into corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or other administrative remedies, and result in our incurring substantial unanticipated costs and the diversion of key personnel and management\u2019s attention from their regular duties, any of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, and may result in greater and continuing governmental scrutiny of our business in the future.\nAdditionally, federal, state and foreign governments and entities have enacted laws and issued regulations and other standards requiring increased visibility and transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. For example, the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act, now known as Open Payments, requires us to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, payments and other transfers of value to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals, with the reported information made publicly available on a searchable website. Effective January 2022 we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. Failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business, and we have had and will continue to spend substantial time and financial resources to develop and implement enhanced structures, policies, systems and processes to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInternational regulatory approval processes may take more or less time than the FDA clearance or approval process. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA and comparable non-U.S. regulatory requirements, we may not receive regulatory clearances or approvals or may be subject to FDA or comparable non-U.S. enforcement actions. We may be unable to obtain future regulatory clearance or approval in a timely manner, or at all, especially if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted. For example, the FDA clearance or approval process can take longer than anticipated due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements. A failure or delay in obtaining necessary regulatory clearances or approvals would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, more stringent regulatory requirements or safety and quality standards may be issued in the future with an adverse effect on our business. We have ceased manufacturing and marketing MelaFind but must still maintain records for FDA and foreign regulatory purposes.\nIf required, clinical trials necessary to support a 510(k) notice or PMA application, for new or modified products, will be expensive and will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials will prevent us from commercializing any modified or new products and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support a 510(k) notice or a PMA application will be time-consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in early or later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical studies will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by patients enrolled as subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators, support staff, and proximity of patients to clinical sites and ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive products. In addition, patients participating in clinical trials may die before completion of the trial or suffer adverse medical events unrelated to investigational products.\n- 19 -\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy may be required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis for any clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. The FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur medical device operations are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulatory requirements.\nMedical devices regulated by the FDA are subject to \u201cgeneral controls\u201d which include: registration with the FDA; listing commercially distributed products with the FDA; complying with good manufacturing practices under the quality system regulations; filing reports with the FDA and keeping records relative to certain types of adverse events associated with devices under the medical device reporting regulation; assuring that device labeling complies with device labeling requirements; reporting certain device field removals and corrections to the FDA; and obtaining premarket notification 510(k) clearance for devices prior to marketing. Some devices known as \u201c510(k)-exempt\u201d can be marketed without prior marketing clearance or approval from the FDA. In addition to the \u201cgeneral controls,\u201d some Class II medical devices are also subject to \u201cspecial controls,\u201d including adherence to a particular guidance document and compliance with the performance standard. Instead of obtaining 510(k) clearance, some Class III devices are subject to PMA. In general, obtaining PMA to achieve marketing authorization from the FDA is a more onerous process than seeking 510(k) clearance.\nMany medical devices, such as medical lasers, are also regulated by the FDA as \u201celectronic products.\u201d In general, manufacturers and marketers of \u201celectronic products\u201d are subject to certain FDA regulatory requirements intended to ensure the radiological safety of the products. These requirements include, but are not limited to, filing certain reports with the FDA about the products and defects/safety issues related to the products as well as complying with radiological performance standards.\nThe medical device industry is now experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Companies in our industry are subject to more frequent and more intensive reviews and investigations, often involving the marketing, business practices, and product quality management including standards for device recalls and product labeling. Such reviews and investigations may result in civil and criminal proceedings; the imposition of substantial fines and penalties; the receipt of warning letters, untitled letters, demands for recalls or the seizure of our products; the requirement to enter into corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or other administrative remedies, and result in our incurring substantial unanticipated costs and the diversion of key personnel and management\u2019s attention from their regular duties, any of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, and may result in greater and continuing governmental scrutiny of our business in the future.\nWe must also have the appropriate FDA clearances and/or approvals from other governmental entities in order to lawfully market devices and/or drugs. The FDA, federal, state or foreign governments and agencies may disagree that we have such clearance and/or approvals for all of our products and may take action to prevent the marketing and sale of such devices until such disagreements have been resolved.\nAdditionally, federal, state and foreign governments and entities have enacted laws and issued regulations and other standards requiring increased visibility and transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. For example, the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the U.S. federal level made. Failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business, and we have had and will continue to spend substantial time and financial resources to develop and implement enhanced structures, policies, systems and processes to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business.\n- 20 -\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. As a result, there have been and continue to be proposals by federal, state and foreign governments and regulators as well as third-party insurance providers to limit the growth of these costs. Among these proposals are regulations that could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products, the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, requirements regarding the usage of comparative studies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms to determine the effectiveness and select the products and therapies used for treatment of patients. While we believe our products provide favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate this value to our customers, patients, payers, and regulators is significant and may require longer periods of time and effort in which to obtain acceptance of our products. There is no assurance that our efforts will be successful, and these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThese changes and additional proposed changes in the future could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business. For example, the ACA was enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. They imposed, on medical device manufacturers, a requirement to research into the effectiveness of treatment modalities and institute changes to the reimbursement and payment systems for patient treatments. In addition, governments and regulatory agencies continue to study and propose changes to the laws governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. The FDA is currently exploring ways to modify its 510(k) clearance process. In addition, due to changes at the FDA in general, it has become increasingly more difficult to obtain 510(k) clearance as data requirements have increased. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. However, any changes could make it more difficult for us to maintain or attain clearance or approval to develop and commercialize our products and technologies.\nVarious healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. Furthermore, an expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for our products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business, possibly materially. In addition, if the excise taxes contained in the House or Senate health reform bills are enacted into law, our loss from continuing operations resulting from such an excise tax and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur market acceptance in international markets requires regulatory approvals from foreign governments and may depend on third party reimbursement of participants' cost.\nWe have introduced our XTRAC and VTRAC products into markets in more than 30 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, South Africa and parts of Central and South America through distributors. We cannot be certain that our salesforce and distributor network will be successful in marketing our products in these or other countries or that our distributors will purchase XTRAC or VTRAC systems beyond their current contractual obligations or in accordance with our expectations.\nEven if we obtain and maintain the necessary foreign regulatory registrations or approvals, market acceptance of our products in international markets may be dependent, in part, upon the availability of reimbursement within applicable healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country, and include both government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance. We may seek international reimbursement approvals for our products, but we cannot assure you that any such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, if at all. Failure to receive international reimbursement approvals in any given market could have a material adverse effect on the acceptance or growth of our products in that market or others.\n- 21 -\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more successfully than us.\nThe medical device industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nOur competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used, less costly, or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nOur competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Competition for these people in the medical device industry is intense and we may face challenges in retaining and recruiting such individuals if, for example, other companies may provide more generous compensation and benefits, more diverse opportunities, and better chances for career advancement than we do. Some of these advantages may be more appealing to high-quality candidates and employees than those we have to offer. In addition, the decline in our stock price has created additional challenges by reducing the retention value of our equity awards. Because of the complex and technical nature of our systems and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our technology, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the medical device industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nMany medical device industry companies are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. For example, the Spectranetics Corporation was acquired by Koninklijke Philips N.V in 2017. As the medical device industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to bundle the sale of more products to our customers in return for lower prices. If we reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our revenue would decrease and our earnings, financial condition, or cash flows would suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe actively employ social media as part of our marketing strategy, which could give rise to regulatory violations, liability, breaches of data security or reputational damage.\nDespite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that the use of social media by us, our employees or our customers to communicate about our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable requirements, including requirements of regulatory bodies such as the FDA and Federal Trade Commission. For example, promotional communications and endorsements on social media that, among other things, promote our products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product\u2019s approved labeling (known as \u201coff-label uses\u201d), do not contain a fair balance of information about risks associated with using our products, make comparative or other claims about our products that are not supported by sufficient evidence, and/or do not contain required disclosures could result in enforcement actions against us. In addition, adverse events, product complaints, off-label usage by physicians, unapproved marketing or other unintended messages posted on social media could require an active response from us, which may not be completed in a timely manner and could result in regulatory action by a governing body. Further, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with our corporate policies or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or result in public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers and others. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n- 22 -\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from shipping affected products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief. Our patents may also be subject to challenge on validity grounds, and our patent applications may be rejected.\nThird parties could, in the future, assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current or future products. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of such third parties. Our potential competitors may assert that some aspect of our products infringes their patents. There also may be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more components of our products may inadvertently infringe.\nAny infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, could place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from selling our product unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent. We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign the affected product to avoid infringement.\nA court could order us to pay compensatory damages for such infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products, and/or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. Depending on the nature of the relief ordered by the court, we could become liable for additional damages to third parties.\nWe rely on our patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights to give us a competitive advantage. Whether a patent is valid, or whether a patent application should be granted, is a complex matter of science and law. Therefore we cannot be certain that, if challenged, our patents, patent applications and/or other intellectual property rights would be upheld. If one or more of those patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights are invalidated, rejected or found unenforceable, those outcomes could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we might otherwise have had.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers or suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation or any applicable state equivalent, our manufacturing operations could be interrupted and our potential product sales and operating results could suffer.\nWe and some of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are required to comply with some or all of the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practices or its QSR, which delineates the design controls, document controls, purchasing controls, identification and traceability, production and process controls, acceptance activities, nonconforming product requirements, corrective and preventive action requirements, labeling and packaging controls, handling, storage, distribution and installation requirements, records requirements, servicing requirements, and statistical techniques potentially applicable to the production of our medical devices. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are also subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process if we market its products overseas. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic and announced or unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Our facilities have been inspected by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and we anticipate that we and certain of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers will be subject to additional future inspections. If our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in non-compliance or fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to adverse QSR inspectional findings, FDA could take legal or regulatory enforcement actions against us and/or our products, including but not limited to the cessation of sales or the recall of distributed products, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\n- 23 -\nCurrent regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation. If the FDA does not believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable FDA regulations, the agency could take legal or regulatory enforcement actions against us and/or our products. We are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, other governmental regulatory agencies, as well as certain third-party regulatory groups. Future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies made during the course of these inspections may vary from current interpretations and may adversely affect our business and prospects. The FDA\u2019s and foreign regulatory agencies\u2019 statutes, regulations, or policies may change, and additional government regulation or statutes may be enacted, which could increase post-approval regulatory requirements, or delay, suspend, prevent marketing of any cleared / approved products or necessitate the recall of distributed products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.\nThe medical device industry has been under heightened FDA scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and enforcement actions. If our operations and activities are found to be in violation of any FDA laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and other legal and/or agency enforcement actions. Any penalties, damages, fines, or curtailment or restructuring of our operations or activities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of us being found in violation of FDA laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend ourselves against that action and its underlying allegations, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Where there is a dispute with a federal or state governmental agency that cannot be resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all relevant parties, we may determine that the costs, both real and contingent, are not justified by the commercial returns to us from maintaining the dispute or the product.\nVarious claims, design features or performance characteristics of our medical devices, that we regarded as permitted by the FDA without marketing clearance or approval, may be challenged by the FDA or state regulators. The FDA or state regulatory authorities may find that certain claims, design features or performance characteristics, in order to be made or included in the products, may have to be supported by further studies and marketing clearances or approvals, which could be lengthy, costly and possibly unobtainable.\nIf we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nWe are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses. Failure by us to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, discovery of previously unknown problems with our products (including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency), manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or failure to adequately respond to any FDA observations concerning these issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following actions:\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters issued by the FDA;\n\u2022\nfines, civil penalties, injunctions and criminal prosecution;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\ndelays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of clearance or approval of our products by the FDA or other regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or seizure;\n\u2022\norders for physician or customer notification or device repair, replacement or refund;\n\u2022\ninterruption of production; and\n\u2022\noperating restrictions.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 24 -\nOur medical products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA has the authority to require the recall of commercialized medical device products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf any of our medical products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe may have a need for additional funds in the future and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate those funds from our business.\nOur existing cash position and ability to borrow funds and future revenue may not be sufficient to support the expenses of our operations in the near term, although based upon our cash and cash equivalents, current budgeting and projected cash flow models, we believe that we will be able to support our operations for at least the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. We plan to fund operations by the recurring revenue generated by the use of the XTRAC lasers in the U.S. plus domestic and international sales of our products. If revenues from the sale and use of our existing products are inadequate to fund our operations, we may need to raise additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital or secure alternate financing to fund operations, if necessary, or that we will be able to raise additional capital under terms that are favorable to us. Further, we cannot assure that an acquisition will in any way negate or mitigate our need for future capital. Any additional financing may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we do not have enough capital to fund operations, then we will have to cut costs or raise funds.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds, if necessary, under terms acceptable to us and in the interests of our stockholders, then we will have to take measures to cut operating costs or obtain funds using alternative methods, such as:\n\u2022\nSell or license some of our technologies that we would not otherwise sell or license if we were in a stronger financial position;\n\u2022\nSell or license some of our technologies under terms that are less favorable than they otherwise might have been if we were in a stronger financial position; and\n\u2022\nConsider further business combination transactions with other companies or positioning ourselves to be acquired by another company.\n- 25 -\nIf it became necessary to take one or more of the above-listed actions, then our perceived valuation may be lower, which could impact the market price of our stock. Further, the effects on our operations, financial performance and stock price may be significant if we do not or cannot take one or more of the above-listed actions in a timely manner and when needed, and our ability to do so may be limited significantly due to the instability of the global financial markets and the resulting limitations on available financing to us and to potential licensees, buyers and investors. Additionally these options may not be available to us as all of our assets have been pledged as security for the various financings.\nIf our actual liability for state sales and use taxes is higher than our accrued liability, it could have a material impact on our financial condition.\nIncluded in accrued state sales and use taxes are certain known and estimated sales and use taxes and related penalties and interest to taxing authorities. In our recurring revenue model, we place the XTRAC system in the physician\u2019s office under an arrangement for no upfront charge and generate our revenue on a per-use basis.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are, from time to time, subject to audits performed by state taxing authorities. These actions and proceedings are generally based on the state\u2019s position that the arrangements entered into by the Company are subject to state sales and use tax rather than exempt from applicable law. We are currently under audit by two taxing jurisdictions as it pertains to state sales and/or use tax. One jurisdiction has assessed us an amount of $801,000 for the period from March 2014 through August 2017. We have declined an informal offer to settle at a substantially lower amount and are currently in that jurisdiction\u2019s administrative process of appeal. The second jurisdiction is still conducting its audit and has not made an assessment. In the event there is a determination that the true object of the delivery of phototherapy under the recurring revenue model is a sale or lease of property and it is not a prescription medication or we do not have other defenses where we prevail, we may be subject to state sales taxes in those particular states for previous years and in the future, plus interest and penalties for failure to pay such taxes. If it was determined that our recurring revenue model was not exempt from sales taxes in all states where we do business, and taxes and penalties were imposed in each of those states for the entire period through the expiration of each state\u2019s statute of limitations, state sales and use tax, penalties and interest for such period would have a material negative impact on our financial condition and cash flow.\nWe evaluated our known state sales and use tax liabilities and have restated the opening balances of liabilities on January 1, 2017, and balances of liabilities and expenses as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and have estimated our sales and use tax liability to be approximately $2.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively. We believe our restated accruals have properly recognized that if our arrangements with customers are deemed to be subject to sales tax in a particular state are more likely than not and accordingly, the basis for measurement of the state sales and use tax would be in accordance with ASC 405, Liabilities as a transaction tax. While we believe we have strong positions that our recurring revenue is exempt from sales tax, if it is found that we are subject to sales tax in those particular states where we believe it is more-likely-than-not that the Company would be exempt from sales tax, then potential tax liabilities including interest and penalties would be higher than accrued amounts. If and when we are successful in defending ourselves or in settling the sales tax obligation for a lesser amount, the reversal of this liability is to be recorded in the period the settlement is reached. However, the precise scope, timing and time period at issue, as well as the final outcome of any audit and actual settlements remain uncertain.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures, including through cyber-attacks or other third party breaches that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n- 26 -\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information.\nFurther, data maintained in digital form is subject to risk of cyber-attacks, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Despite our efforts to monitor and safeguard our systems to prevent data compromise, the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering, and theft remain. In addition, we do not have insurance coverage with respect to system failures or cyber-attacks.\nWhile we have implemented a number of protective measures, including firewalls, antivirus, patches, data encryption, log monitors, routine back-ups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning, routine password modifications and disaster recovery procedures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events. If our systems were to fail or we are unable to successfully expand the capacity of these systems, or we are unable to integrate new technologies into our existing systems, our operations and financial results could suffer.\nWe have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we depend on third parties who are responsible for maintaining significant elements of our information technology systems and infrastructure and who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of our third party vendors, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by its employees, partners or vendors. These systems are also vulnerable to attacks by malicious third parties, and may be susceptible to intentional or accidental physical damage to the infrastructure maintained by us or by third parties. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology or information, and/or adversely affect our business. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental and health safety laws may result in liabilities, expenses and restrictions on our operations.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws regarding environmental protection, hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business. Using hazardous substances in our operations exposes us to the risk of accidental injury, contamination or other liability from the use, storage, importation, handling, or disposal of hazardous materials. If our or our suppliers\u2019 operations result in the contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and fines, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Future changes to environmental and health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expenses or restrict our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nIn the event of certain contingencies, the investors in the May 2018 Equity Financing may receive additional shares issued pursuant to the Retained Risk Provisions as defined in the purchase agreements.\nIn the event of certain contingencies, the investors in the May 2018 equity financing may receive additional shares issued pursuant to the Retained Risk Provisions as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreements. At the closing, the Company determined certain contingencies had been met and in July 2018 the Company issued 153,004 shares associated with those contingencies. There are additional contingencies included in the SPAs that the Company has determined are not probable or estimable and/or contractually obligated in order to issue shares at this time.\n- 27 -\nAs a result of a financing in June 2015 we incurred significant debt in the form of convertible preferred stock. In order to repay the underlying debt and help make our stock more liquid, we entered into an exchange agreement with holders of the debt and issued them a new class of preferred shares. Any remaining preferred shares, which have not been converted, present dilution risk for our shareholders.\nOn September 20, 2017, we announced the closing of an exchange transaction pursuant to the Securities Exchange Agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\") dated as of June 7, 2017, between us and holders of our June 2015 Debentures and July 2014 Debentures. In closing the exchange transaction, the holders of the Debentures exchanged the Debentures, having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $40.5 million, into 40,482 shares (the \"Preferred Shares\") of our newly created Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. The Preferred Shares are convertible into a total of approximately 15,049,000 shares of our common stock. Each Preferred Share has a stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.69. As of October 22, 2019, 38,379 Preferred Shares have been converted into 14,267,053 shares of common stock and 2,103 Preferred Shares convertible into 781,947 shares of common stock remain outstanding.\nWe have concluded that certain of our previously issued financial statements should not be relied upon and have restated certain of our previously issued financial statements, which may lead to, among other things, shareholder litigation, loss of investor confidence, negative impact on our stock price and certain other risks.\nAs discussed in the Explanatory Note, we have concluded that our previously issued financial statements have been restated, and should no longer be relied upon. The determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that certain financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements. As a result of these misstatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with the restatement, shareholder litigation and government investigations. Any such proceeding could result in substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation or investigation. If we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weaknesses have led to a conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for prior periods, including as of December 31, 2018. Our ability to remediate these material weaknesses, our discovery of additional weaknesses, and our inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, have and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations, our stock price and investor confidence in our Company.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in more detail under \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in Part II, Item 9A of this Report, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective due to the material weaknesses described below.\nThe design and operating effectiveness of our controls were inadequate to ensure that complex accounting matters are properly accounted for and reviewed in a timely manner. As a result, we failed to accurately record complex debt and equity transactions and certain state net operating loss carryforwards and properly evaluate the work performed by outside experts and consultants as that work pertained to impairment of intangibles which improperly resulted in recognition of an impairment charge. In addition, our internal controls were inadequate in the selection of proper accounting policies as it pertained to certain state sales and use tax liabilities and assumptions related to deferred revenue. These material weaknesses caused the restatements of our first, second and third quarter 2018 and 2017 filings and annual 2017 filing. Any effects of errors from the period prior to January 1, 2017, have been restated as of January 1, 2017, in the balance sheet. These errors are a result of the following control deficiencies.\nControl Environment and Risk Assessment\nThe Company did not have an effective control environment with the structure necessary for effective internal controls over financial reporting. Further, the Company did not have an effective risk assessment to identify and assess risks associated with changes to the Company\u2019s structure and the impact on internal controls. The Company did not have appropriately qualified personnel to meet the Company\u2019s control objectives and with an appropriate level of US GAAP knowledge and experience to properly review and evaluate the work performed by other Company personnel, outside experts and consultants related to complex accounting matters.\n- 28 -\nControl Activities\nThe Company did not have control activities that were designed and operating effectively, including management review controls, controls related to monitoring and assessing the work of consultants, and controls to verify the completeness and adequacy of information. Specifically, the Company did not have procedures for competent personnel to review work performed by outside experts and consultants in relation to complex debt and equity transactions, certain state net operating loss carryforwards, impairment valuations, the selection of appropriate accounting policies as it pertained to state sales and use tax liabilities and assumptions related to deferred revenue.\nMonitoring Activities\nThe Company did not maintain effective monitoring controls related to the financial reporting process. The Company did not effectively monitor the controls associated with the use of outside experts and consultants. The failure to properly monitor impacted the timing, accuracy, and completion of the work related to significant accounting matters.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer continue to review our controls relating to complex accounting matters.\nIf we fail to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. Any of these could result in delisting by The NASDAQ Stock Market, investigation and sanctions by regulatory authorities, exposure to litigation and adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nWe are remediating certain internal controls and procedures, which, if not successful, could result in additional misstatements in our financial statements negatively affecting our results of operations.\nWe are in the process of implementing certain remediation actions. See Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K for a description of these remediation measures. To the extent these steps are not successful, not sufficient to correct our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting or are not completed in a timely manner, future financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and stock price and limit our ability to access the capital markets through equity or debt issuances.\nOur stock price may be volatile, meaning purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for medical technology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section and general market and economic conditions, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our products to achieve or continue to have commercial success;\n\u2022\nthe timing of regulatory approval for our future products;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory determinations with respect to our existing products;\n\u2022\nresults of our research and development efforts and our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture our products to commercial standards;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our clinical collaborators, suppliers or marketing partners;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\npublic concern over our products;\n- 29 -\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims and litigation against us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our balance sheet; and any perceived need to raise additional funds;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results from expected financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of third-party reimbursement in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or practices;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock.\nA decline in the market price of our common stock could cause you to lose some or all of your investment, limit your ability to sell your shares of stock and may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees and raise capital. In addition, stockholders have, and may in the future, initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. Our insurance to cover claims of this sort may not be adequate.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of our stock.\nProvisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nlimit who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which would otherwise permit less than a majority of stockholders to elect directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprovide our board of directors the ability to designate the terms of and issue a new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. In connection with the Financing, our board of directors exempted AGP SPVI, L.P. from the application of this provision in connection with its investment.\nThese provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90955, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "SSKN"}
