{"cik": "1494582", "company": "REO PLUS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the risks discussed below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur extremely limited history makes an evaluation of our future extremely difficult, and profits are not assured. At this stage of our business operations, even with our good faith efforts, potential investors have a possibility of losing their investment.\nOur company was organized in August 2009 for the purposes of engaging in the real estate business. We currently have only one meaningful asset, and we have had no meaningful operating history upon which to base an evaluation of us and our business and prospects. Our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development. For our business plan to succeed, we must successfully undertake most of the following activities:\n* Raise a sufficient amount of funds\n* Identify and complete suitable acquisitions\n* Enter into favorable agreements with third parties regarding a variety of matters\n* Implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy\n* Respond to competitive developments\n* Attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking such activities. Our failure to undertake successfully most of the activities described above could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue, that we will ever generate positive cash flow from our operations or that (if ever attained) we will be able to sustain profitability in any future period. Moreover, our business may fail for a variety of reasons, such as changes in market conditions, competition, the general economy, and the like. Our shares should be regarded as speculative investments. There is no assurance that investors will obtain any return on their investment, and investors will be subject to a risk of losing their entire investment.\nOur failure to obtain needed additional capital in the future may result in our inability to finance future acquisitions and fund our working capital requirements.\nWe need to procure additional financing to finance future acquisitions and our current operations. If additional financing were not available on acceptable terms, we would be prevented from acquiring additional properties or continuing our business. In such event, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, any debt financing undertaken to procure funds may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we obtain funds through the issuance of equity securities, the following results will or may occur:\n*\nThe percentage ownership of our existing shareholders will be reduced\n*\nOur shareholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per unit\n*\nThe new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, if required operating capital is not available on acceptable terms, we could be forced to dispose of certain of our assets or curtail our operations substantially or completely, which could result in a substantial reduction or elimination of the value of our then-outstanding equity. Our future liquidity will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of our business efforts and our capital raising activities.\nOur auditor's \"going concern\" qualification, which questions our ability to continue as a going concern, could impair our ability to raise needed capital.\nOur independent certified public accountant has added an emphasis paragraph to its report on our financial statements regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Key to this determination is our accumulated losses and lack of revenues. We plan on trying to raise additional equity capital and (subject thereto) to acquire additional properties that would help make us profitable. The auditor's \"going concern\" qualification might impede our ability to raise funds. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends upon our ability to attain a satisfactory level of profitability, and obtain suitable and adequate financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives, or continuing our business without either a temporary interruption or a permanent cessation.\nOur failure to manage effectively any significant growth that we may experience could harm our operational results.\nWe believe that, given the right business opportunities (including the availability of needed capital), we may expand our operations rapidly and significantly. If rapid growth were to occur, it could place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. To manage any significant growth of our operations, we will be required to undertake the following successfully:\n* Manage relationships with various strategic partners and other third parties;\n* Hire and retain skilled personnel necessary to support our business;\n* Train and manage a growing employee base; and\n* Continually develop our financial and information management systems.\nIf we fail to make adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with this expansion or if our systems, procedures or controls are not adequate to support our operations, our business could be harmed. For example, we could be overwhelmed by an extended number of properties such that we are unable to manage them effectively and to perceive adverse trends. Thus, under such circumstance we could be acquiring properties at a time when we should be liquidating them. The adverse effects of occurrence would be compounded by any use by us of debt to acquire our properties. Our inability to manage growth effectively could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be harmed by the failure of third party suppliers upon whom we expect to depend to perform in accordance with our expectations and needs.\nOur operations will depend on a number of third parties, such as real estate brokers and management companies. We will have limited control over these third parties. We will probably not have many long-term agreements with many of them. Our inability to maintain satisfactory relationships with such third parties on acceptable commercial terms, or the failure of such third parties to maintain the quality of products and services they provide at a satisfactory standard, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have made an election that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law on April 5, 2012. As permitted under Section 102(b)(1) of this Act, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nReal property investments involve certain general risks not within our control.\nAll real property investments are subject to considerable risks, many of which are beyond our control. These risks (many of which are discussed in further detail herein) include:\n*\nAdverse changes in international, national, regional or local economic, demographic and market conditions;\n*\nAdverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties;\n*\nCompetition from other real estate investors with significant capital;\n*\nReductions in the level of demand for commercial space, and changes in the relative popularity of properties;\n*\nFluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability, or the ability of buyers and tenants of properties, to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;\n*\nUnanticipated increases in operating expenses, including, without limitation, insurance costs, labor costs, energy prices and costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies;\n*\nChanges in, and changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws and governmental fiscal policies, and changes in the related costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies; and\n*\nCivil unrest, acts of God, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of terrorist acts such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001, which may result in uninsured losses.\nOur business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any adverse change or development in one or more of the risks listed above.\nOur inability to identify suitable acquisitions, and even the acquisitions themselves, may harm our financial results.\nWe may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria, or consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms. Failures in identifying or consummating acquisitions would impair the pursuit of our business plan. Shareholders ultimately may not like the location, lease terms or other relevant economic and financial data of any real properties, other assets or other companies that we may acquire in the future. Moreover, our acquisition strategy could involve significant risks that could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results, including the following: increases in asking prices by acquisition candidates to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria; diversion of management's attention to expansion efforts; unanticipated costs and contingent or undisclosed liabilities associated with acquisitions; failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results; and difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience. The consideration paid for our target acquisition may exceed fair market value, which may harm our financial condition and operating results. The consideration that we pay will be based upon numerous factors, and the target acquisition may be purchased in a negotiated transaction rather than through a competitive bidding process. We cannot provide any assurance that the purchase price that we pay for a target acquisition or its appraised value will be a fair price, that we will be able to generate an acceptable return on such target acquisition, or that the location, lease terms or other relevant economic and financial data of any properties that we acquire will meet acceptable risk profiles. We may also be unable to lease vacant space or renegotiate existing leases at market rates, which would adversely affect our returns on a target acquisition. As a result, our investments in our target acquisition may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations, which may substantially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nThe failure of our properties to generate positive cash flow or to appreciate in value would most likely preclude our shareholders from realizing a return on their share ownership.\nThere is no assurance that our real estate investments will appreciate in value or will ever be sold at a profit. The marketability and value of the properties will depend upon many factors beyond the control of our management. There is no assurance that there will be a ready market for the properties, since investments in real property are generally non-liquid. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by it, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Moreover, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure any person that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to lockout provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These lockout provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could significantly harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties or investments in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited. In particular, these risks could arise from weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property, changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers, changes in national or international economic conditions, and changes in laws, regulations or fiscal policies of jurisdictions in which the property is located. We may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale, other disposition or refinance at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy.\nIntense competition for the acquisition of real estate properties could preclude us from completing otherwise attractive acquisitions or could cause us to pay higher prices that harm our financial results.\nWe compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of desirable properties. These competitors may drive up the price we must pay for real estate properties, other assets or other companies that we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those companies or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\") may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. This will result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them. If we pay higher prices for properties, our profitability will be reduced, and shareholders may experience a lower return on their investment. Moreover, prices could become so lofty that we are unable to pay them (or we decide not to run the risks associated with these prices) such that we are effectively precluded from pursuing our business plan in a meaningful manner.\nRising operating expenses and decreases in rents at our properties could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future dividends.\nOur properties will likely be subject to operating risks common to real estate in general, any or all of which may negatively affect us. If any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses, we could be required to expend funds for that property's operating expenses. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below market rates, or below the rental rates we charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants' leases expire. Our properties could also be subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses. Such rise in operating expenses and loss of rents could reduce our cash flows and funds available for future dividends.\nFailure of our tenants to pay rent could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may rely on rental payments from tenants of a target acquisition as a source of cash. At any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy, insolvency, or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant's lease and material losses to our company. A default by a large tenant on one of these properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if any of our significant tenants becomes insolvent, suffers a downturn in its business and decides not to renew its lease or vacates a property and prevents us from leasing that property by continuing to pay base rent for the balance of the term, it may seriously harm our business. Failure on the part of a tenant to comply with the terms of a lease may give us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the applicable property and enforce the payment obligations under the lease; however, we would be required to find another tenant. We cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to find another tenant without incurring substantial costs, or at all, or that, if another tenant was found, we would be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of our tenants under their leases could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.\nAny bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants could bar us from collecting pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant or its property. A tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums. If the tenant assumes a lease in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. However, if a tenant rejects a lease in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt entity may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. We may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims, which would harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to promptly re-let or renew leases as they expire, our cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness, if any, may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to the risks that upon expiration of leases for space located in our buildings (a) such leases may not be renewed, (b) such space may not be re-let or (c) the terms of renewal or re-letting, taking into account the cost of required renovations, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. If we are unable to promptly re-let, or renew the leases for, a substantial portion of the space located in our buildings, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or re-letting are significantly lower than expected rental rates, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate, our cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness, if any, may be adversely affected.\nIncreases in our property taxes could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nEach of our properties will be subject to real and personal property taxes. These taxes on our properties may increase as tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. Many states and localities are considering increases in their income and/or property tax rates (or increases in the assessments of real estate) to cover revenue shortfalls. If property taxes increase, it may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nInflation could cause our expenses to rise to levels that harm our operating results.\nWe may experience increases in our expenses, including debt service, as a result of inflation and increase in interest rates. Our exposure to inflationary cost increases in property level expenses may be reduced by escalation clauses that are included in our leases. However, market conditions may prevent us from escalating rents. Inflationary pressure may increase operating expenses, including labor and energy costs and, indirectly, real estate taxes, above expected levels at a time when it may not be possible for us to increase lease rates to offset these higher operating expenses. In addition, inflation can have secondary effects upon occupancy rates by decreasing the demand for office space in many of the markets in which we operate.\nThe foreclosure of any one or more of our properties could result in a significant loss to us.\nIf, after our purchase of any real estate property is concluded, we cannot meet the periodic payments required by our outside financing, we might be required to sell or refinance the property to meet our obligations. If refinancing is not obtained or a sale is not consummated, we could default in our obligations. The remedy of the outside financier would be, among other things, to institute foreclosure proceedings against the related property, which could result in the partial or total loss of any equity in such property. The loss of any of our properties by foreclosure would probably have a materially adverse effect on our asset base and on our financial performance as our equity in the property would have to be written off.\nUninsured losses could harm our operating results.\nWe expect that our tenants or we will purchase comprehensive insurance, including liability and extended coverage, with respect to our properties with limits customary for such properties. However, certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Such excluded risks generally include war, earthquakes, floods and punitive damages. Should a loss occur (whether insured or uninsured), we might suffer a loss of invested capital and any profits that might be anticipated from our real estate investment and might also be unable to meet our obligations. For example, even if insured, we would have to pay insurance deductibles, and the insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the property. Moreover, in the event of an underinsured loss with respect to a property relating to a title defect, the insurance proceeds we receive might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to such property.\nEnvironmental regulation and issues, certain of which we may have no control over, may adversely impact our business.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations impose environmental controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that directly impact the management, development, use, and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, and may therefore adversely affect us specifically, and the real estate industry in general. Failure by us to uncover and adequately protect against environmental issues in connection with a target acquisition may subject us to liability as buyer of such property or asset. Environmental laws and regulations impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property. We may be held liable for such costs as a subsequent owner of such property. Liability can be imposed even if the original actions were legal and we had no knowledge of, or were not responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Further, we may also be held responsible for the entire payment of the liability if we are subject to joint and several liability and the other responsible parties are unable to pay. We may also be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site, including the presence of asbestos containing materials. Insurance for such matters may not be available. Additionally, new or modified environmental regulations could develop in a manner that could adversely affect us.\nOur future properties could contain asbestos that could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating asbestos.\nCertain laws and regulations govern the removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials (or \"ACMs\"), when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of building renovation or demolition, impose certain worker protection and notification requirements and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. These laws may also impose liability for a release of ACMs and may enable third parties to seek recovery against us for personal injury associated with ACMs. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures if properties we acquire contain ACMs, and these expenditures could materially adversely affect us and our operating results and financial condition.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unexpected expenditures that materially adversely affect us.\nCertain properties we acquire may be required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the \"ADA.\" The ADA has separate compliance requirements for \"public accommodations\" and \"commercial facilities,\" but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. While the tenants to whom we lease properties will be obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and under our net leases will typically be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of such tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, we will be required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements, and these expenditures could materially adversely affect us and our operating results and financial condition.\nInvestors will not receive the benefit of the regulations provided to real estate investment trusts or investment companies.\nWe are not a real estate investment trust and enjoy a broader range of permissible activities. We are also not, and we intend to operate in such manner as not to be, classified as an \"investment company\" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The management and the investment practices and policies of ours are not supervised or regulated by any Federal or state authority. As a result, investors will be exposed to certain risks that would not be present if we were subjected to a more restrictive regulatory situation.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted\nIf we are ever deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we may be subject to certain restrictions including:\n*\nRestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n*\nRestrictions on the issuance of securities.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n*\nRegistration as an investment company;\n*\nAdoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n*\nReporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe highly depend on Richard J. Church. The loss of Mr. Church's services would probably harm our ability to execute our business plan.\nOur success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of Richard J. Church, our sole director and officer. Mr. Church has not entered into an employment agreement or a non-compete agreement with us. As a result, he may discontinue providing his services to us at any time and for any reason, and even thereafter might be able to commence competition with us. We currently maintain no key person insurance on Mr. Church's life. If we were to lose the services of Mr. Church, our ability to execute our business plan could be harmed and we may be forced to cease operations until such time as we could hire a suitable replacement for him.\nBecause management owns a large percentage of our outstanding stock, and cumulative voting and preemptive rights are denied to shareholders, shareholders' ability to influence our direction will be limited.\nRichard J. Church, our sole director and officer, owns approximately 95% of our outstanding common stock. Cumulative voting in the election of Directors is denied as permitted by law. Accordingly, the holder or holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock (i.e. Mr. Church) may elect all of our Board of Directors. Our management will exclusively make nearly all decisions with respect to the management of our business. Investors will have little right or power to take part in the management of our business. Although an investor is entitled to vote on certain matters, a person should not purchase any shares of common stock unless he is willing to entrust all aspects of the management of our business to our current management. There are no preemptive rights in connection with our common stock. Thus, the percentage ownership of existing shareholders may be diluted if we issue additional shares in the future. In all, investors will have little (if any) ability to change the direction of our company if they believe such direction to be misguided, and we will suffer the consequence of any such misguided direction.\nThe inability of our management to manage our current and future operations could harm these operations and our financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that the current level of management will remain sufficient to perform all responsibilities necessary or beneficial for management to perform. Our success in attracting additional qualified personnel will depend on many factors, including our ability to provide them with competitive compensation arrangements, equity participation and other benefits. There is no assurance that (if we need to) we will be successful in attracting highly qualified individuals in key management positions. The inability to attract such individuals will be particularly felt if we experience rapid growth, in which case we will be exposed to the risks described in the risk factor captioned \"Our failure to manage effectively any significant growth that we may experience could harm our operational results\" above.\nOur sole officer and director will allocate some portion of his time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in his determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs as well as other matters.\nRichard J. Church, our current sole executive officer and director, is not required to commit his full time to our affairs, which could create a conflict of interest when allocating his time between our operations and his other commitments. Mr. Church is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If Mr. Church's other activities require him to devote more substantial amounts of time to them, it could limit his ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue our business plan. Additionally, Mr. Church and future company officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe fiduciary duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. We cannot provide any assurance that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nLimitations on claims against our officers and directors, and our obligation to indemnify them, could prevent our recovery for losses caused by them.\nThe corporation law of Texas allows a Texas corporation to eliminate or limit the liability of its directors to the corporation and its shareholders except whenever the director has:\n(1)\nBreached his or her duty of loyalty, if any, to the organization or its owners or members;\n(2)\nCommitted an act or omission not in good faith that: (A) constitutes a breach of duty of the person to the organization; or (B) involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n(3)\nBeen involved in a transaction from which the person received an improper benefit, regardless of whether the benefit resulted from an action taken within the scope of the person's duties; or\n(4)\nCommitted an act or omission for which the liability of a governing person is expressly provided by an applicable statute.\nOur Certificate of Formation has eliminated our directors' and officers' personal liability to the maximum extent permitted by law. The corporation law of Texas allows a Texas corporation to indemnify each director, officer, agent and/or employee to the extent that certain standards are met, and our Certificate of Formation provides that each director is indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law. Further, we may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such persons whether or not we have the power to indemnify such person against the liability insured against. Consequently, because of the actions or omissions of officers, directors, agents and employees, we could incur substantial losses and be prevented from recovering such losses from such persons. Further, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") maintains that indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") is against the public policy expressed in the Securities Act, and is therefore unenforceable pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Act.\nOur acquisition of our sole current property interest from the person who owns a controlling interest in our company that was not at arms-length may have caused us to complete this acquisition on terms less favorable than if it had been completed at arms-length.\nWe acquired our sole current property interest from Richard J. Church, our sole director and officer for 934,500 shares of our common stock and a promissory note in the amount of $190,000. Mr. Church originally acquired this interest in 2004 for approximately $106,000. Based on substantive back-up procured shortly prior to these transactions, Mr. Church believes that such transactions were commercially reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that the terms and conditions of the interest acquisition are as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained in true arms-length negotiations. Moreover, because Mr. Church is the sole member of our management, there can be no assurance that we would enforce a claim against Mr. Church arising out of any problem related to the acquisition. Overall, the risks that we assumed in connection with this related party transaction include the possibilities that we paid too much for the property, that insufficient due diligence was conducted on the property, that the documentation governing the transaction does not adequately protect us, and that we might not enforce any rights and claims that we have or may have against Mr. Church relating to the transaction.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SHARES\nThere has not been any prior trading market for our shares, and a trading market for our shares may not develop.\nNo established public market for the trading of shares of our common stock now exists. Subject to the sponsorship of a market maker, shares of our common stock will be traded in an over-the-counter market, such as the OTCQB or the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance as to the prices at which the shares of our common stock will trade. Until an orderly market develops for our common stock and even thereafter, the prices of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Prices for shares of our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity of the markets for shares of common stock, investor perception of the Company and the industry in which the Company participates, and general economic and market conditions.\nThe issuance of shares of our capital stock to complete property acquisitions would reduce the equity interest of our shareholders.\nOur certificate of formation authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. We have over 498,000,000 authorized but un-issued shares of our common stock available for issuance and all of the 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance. Although we have no commitment as of the date hereof, we could in the future issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common or preferred stock, or a combination of common and preferred stock, to complete one or more property acquisitions. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or any number of shares of our preferred stock:\n*\nMay significantly reduce the equity interest of existing shareholders;\n*\nMay subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock; and\n*\nMay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nPotential registered sales of our shares may have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nPresently, 1,869,000 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding, all of which are \"restricted securities\" as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\"). Approximately 930,493 of these shares of common stock have been registered with the Commission, and can now be sold pursuant to an effective and current prospectus. A trading market for our shares of common stock does not now exist. However, once such a market exists, holders of our common stock may decide that they do not want to continue to hold their shares and may decide to sell them. The registration of these shares requires them to be publicly sold at a fixed price of $0.12 per share. This fixed price could materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, as prospective purchasers of our common stock could be deterred from purchasing them, if other holders are constrained to sell at a fixed price that could limit the potential rise in share price. This fixed price might also adversely affect the Company's ability to raise additional equity capital.\nThe trading price of our common stock may entail additional regulatory requirements, which may negatively affect such trading price.\nWe expect that the trading price of our common stock will start below $5.00 per share. If this occurs, trading in our common stock will be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades generally involving any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith, and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions). For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. As a consequence, the market liquidity of our common stock could be severely affected or limited by these regulatory requirements.\nOur authorized preferred stock exposes holders of our common stock to certain risks.\nOur Certificate of Formation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The authorized but un-issued preferred stock constitutes what is commonly referred to as \"blank check\" preferred stock. This type of preferred stock may be issued by the Board of Directors from time to time on any number of occasions, without shareholder approval, as one or more separate series of shares comprised of any number of the authorized but un-issued shares of preferred stock, designated by resolution of the Board of Directors stating the name and number of shares of each series and setting forth separately for such series the relative rights, privileges and preferences thereof, including, if any, the: (i) rate of dividends payable thereon; (ii) price, terms and conditions of redemption; (iii) voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences; (iv) provisions of a sinking fund for redemption or repurchase; (v) terms of conversion to common stock, including conversion price, and (vi) voting rights. Such preferred stock may provide our Board of Directors the ability to hinder or discourage any attempt to gain control of us by a merger, tender offer at a control premium price, proxy contest or otherwise. Consequently, the preferred stock could entrench our management. The market price of our common stock could be depressed to some extent by the existence of the preferred stock. As of the date of this Annual Report, no shares of preferred stock had been issued.\nBecause our Board of Directors does not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, shareholders may have to sell their shares of our common stock to realize a return on their investment in the company.\nThe holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore. To date, we have paid no dividends. Our Board of Directors does not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future, but instead intends to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations. Accordingly, a return on an investment in shares of our common stock may be realized only through a sale of such shares, if at all.", "PERMNO": 16779, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "BOMN"}
