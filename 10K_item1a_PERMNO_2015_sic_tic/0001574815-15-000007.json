{"cik": "1574815", "company": "STOCK BUILDING SUPPLY HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe industry in which we operate is dependent upon the homebuilding industry and repair and remodeling activity, the economy, the credit markets and other important factors.\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly dependent on new home construction and repair and remodeling activity, which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, health care costs, housing affordability, housing inventory levels, a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business.\nThe homebuilding industry underwent a significant downturn that began in mid-2006 and began to stabilize in late 2011. The downturn in the homebuilding industry resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for our products and services, which in turn had a significant adverse effect on our business during fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The U.S. Census Bureau reported approximately 647,000 single-family housing starts for 2014, which is an increase of approximately 5% from 2013, but still well below historical averages over the past 50 years. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of any recovery in construction and repair and remodeling activity and resulting product demand levels. The positive impact of a recovery on our business may also be dampened to the extent the average selling price or average size of new single family homes decreases, which could cause homebuilders to decrease spending on our products and services.\nIn addition, beginning in 2007, the mortgage markets experienced substantial disruption due to increased defaults, primarily as a result of credit quality deterioration. The disruption resulted in a stricter regulatory environment and reduced availability of mortgages for potential home buyers due to a tight credit market and stricter standards to qualify for mortgages. Mortgage financing and commercial credit for smaller homebuilders, as well as for the development of new residential lots, continue to be constrained. As the housing industry is dependent upon the economy and employment levels as well as potential homebuyers\u2019 access to mortgage financing and homebuilders\u2019 access to commercial credit, it is likely that the housing industry will not fully recover until conditions in the economy and the credit markets improve and unemployment rates decline. Prolonged weakness in the homebuilding industry would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a result of the homebuilding industry downturn, there has been a trend of significant consolidation as smaller, private homebuilders have gone out of business. We refer to the large homebuilders as \u201cproduction homebuilders.\u201d While we generate significant business from these homebuilders, our gross margins on sales to them tend to be lower than our gross margins on sales to other market segments. This could impact our gross margins as homebuilding recovers if the market share held by the production homebuilders increases.\nChanges in federal income tax laws may also affect demand for new homes. Various proposals have been publicly discussed to limit mortgage interest deductions and to limit the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. Enactment of such proposals may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general. No meaningful prediction can be made as to whether any such proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the particular form such laws would take. Because we have substantial fixed costs, relatively modest declines in our customers\u2019 production levels could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe building products supply and services industry is seasonal and cyclical.\nOur industry is seasonal. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, our first and fourth quarters have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced construction activity. To the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, floods, fires, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the markets in which we operate, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe building products supply and services industry is also subject to cyclical market pressures. Quarterly results historically have reflected, and are expected to continue to reflect, fluctuations from period to period arising from the following: the volatility of lumber prices; the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry; general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete; the pricing policies of our competitors and the production schedules of our customers.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our results.\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from local, regional and national building materials chains, as well as from privately-owned single site enterprises. Any of these competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, (ii) provide superior service and sell superior products, (iii) have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost, (iv) develop stronger relationships with our customers, (v) adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do, (vi) develop a superior branch network in our markets or (vii) have access to financing on more favorable terms that we can obtain. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with them. In addition, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors, may in the future intensify their marketing efforts to professional homebuilders. Furthermore, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to production homebuilders. The volume of such direct sales could increase in the future. Additionally, manufacturers and specialty distributors who sell products to us may elect to sell and distribute directly to homebuilders in the future or enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other distributors. Consolidation of production homebuilders may result in increased competition for their business. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or product prices at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nCertain of our products are commodities and fluctuations in prices of these commodities could affect our operating results.\nMany of the building products we distribute, including OSB, plywood, lumber and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently based on participants\u2019 perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. A shortage of capacity or excess capacity in the industry can result in significant increases or declines in market prices for those products, often within a short period of time.\nPrices of commodity products can also change as a result of national and international economic conditions, labor and freight costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of lumber and other products. Short-term changes in the cost of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes passed on to our customers but our pricing quotation periods and pricing pressure from our competitors may limit our ability to pass on such price changes. For example, we frequently enter into extended pricing commitments, which may compress our gross margins in periods of inflation. At times, the price at which we can charge our customers for any one or more products may even fall below the price at which we can purchase such products, requiring us to incur short-term losses on product sales. We may also be limited in our ability to pass on increases in freight costs on our products due to the price of fuel.\nPeriods of generally increasing prices provide the opportunity for higher sales and increased gross profit (subject to the extended pricing commitments described above), while generally declining price environments may result in declines in sales and profitability. In particular, low market prices for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows, as can excessive spikes in market prices. While we experienced increasing prices from 2011 to 2013 as the homebuilding market recovered, for the year ended December 31, 2014, average composite framing lumber prices and average composite structural panel prices (a composite calculation based on index prices for OSB and plywood) as reported by Random Lengths were 0% and 10% lower, respectively, than the prior year. Our lumber & lumber sheet goods product category represented approximately 35% of net sales in 2014. If lumber or structural panel prices were to decline significantly from current levels, our sales and profits would be negatively affected.\nWe are exposed to product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims and legal proceedings related to our business, products and services as well as services provided for us through third parties.\nWe are from time to time involved in product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims relating to our business, the products we manufacture, distribute or install, and services we provide, either directly or through third parties, that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows if we were unable to seek indemnification for such claims or were not adequately insured for such claims. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with many of the products we sell, distribute or install. Because we do not have direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, homebuilders and their subcontractors, and third-party installers for which we may be liable. We and they are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our Company. We cannot assure you that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nPursuant to the restructuring and investment agreement dated May 5, 2009 by and among our predecessor, Saturn Acquisition Holdings, LLC, Gores Holdings and Wolseley, Wolseley agreed to indemnify us for, among other things, losses arising from any third-party claim (i) existing as of May 5, 2009 or (ii) brought or asserted against the Company arising from actions taken by Wolseley or the Company prior to May 5, 2009. In accordance with the restructuring and investment agreement, Wolseley was not liable for any claim for indemnification until the aggregate amount to be recovered by us exceeded $3.0 million, which occurred in 2011. In the event Wolseley is unable or unwilling to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us, we would be responsible for any liabilities arising from actions taken prior to May 5, 2009 and the costs of defending claims related thereto. The resulting increase in our liabilities or litigation expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may be unable to maintain profitability or positive cash flows from operations.\nWe have set goals to progressively improve our profitability over time by growing our sales, increasing our gross margin and reducing our expenses as a percentage of sales. For the fiscal year ended 2014 we had net income of $10.4 million and cash provided by operations of $16.9 million. For the fiscal year ended 2013 we had a net loss of $4.6 million and used cash from operations of $40.3 million. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our enhanced profitability goals or continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. Factors that could significantly adversely affect our efforts to achieve these goals include, but are not limited to, the failure to:\n\u2022\ngrow our revenue through organic growth or through acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimprove our revenue mix by investing (including through acquisitions) in businesses that provide higher gross margins than we have been able to generate historically;\n\u2022\nachieve improvements in purchasing or maintain or increase our rebates from suppliers through our supplier consolidation and/or low-cost country initiatives;\n\u2022\nimprove our gross margins through the utilization of improved pricing practices and technology and sourcing savings;\n\u2022\nmaintain or reduce our overhead and support expenses as we grow;\n\u2022\neffectively evaluate future inventory reserves;\n\u2022\ncollect monies owed from customers;\n\u2022\nmaintain relationships with our significant customers; and\n\u2022\nintegrate any businesses acquired.\nAny of these failures or delays may adversely affect our ability to increase our profitability.\nHomebuilding activities in the Texas, North Carolina, California, Georgia and Utah markets have a large impact on our results of operations because we conduct a significant portion of our business in these markets.\nWe presently conduct a significant portion of our business in the Texas, North Carolina, California, Georgia and Utah markets, which represented approximately 33%, 15%, 11%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of our 2014 total net sales. Home prices and sales activities in these markets and in most of the other markets in which we operate have declined from time to time, particularly as a result of slow economic growth. In the last several years, these markets have benefited from better than average employment growth, which has aided homebuilding activities, but we cannot assure you that these conditions will continue. Local economic conditions can depend on a variety of factors, including national economic conditions, local and state budget situations and the impact of cutbacks in federal spending and employment. In addition, the recent significant decline in oil prices may negatively impact home construction and remodeling activity in Texas or other markets with significant employment in the energy sector, which could negatively impact our operating results in those markets in the future. If homebuilding activity declines in one or more of the markets in which we operate, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and therefore may negatively impact our operating results.\nResidential renovation and improvement activity levels may not return to historic levels, which may negatively impact our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur business relies on residential renovation and improvement (including repair and remodeling) activity levels. Unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction in which we did not experience comparable declines in our sales related to home improvement, the recent economic decline adversely affected our home improvement business as well. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2014 residential improvement project spending in the United States remained approximately 20% below its peak in 2006. High unemployment levels, high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates, limitations in the availability of mortgage and home improvement financing and significantly lower housing turnover, may limit consumers\u2019 spending, particularly on discretionary items, and affect their confidence level leading to continued reduced spending on home improvement projects.\nWe cannot predict the timing or strength of a significant recovery, if any. Continued depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvement and new home construction will continue to adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position. Furthermore, continued economic weakness may cause unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and in the business models and strategies of our customers. Such shifts may alter the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our operating performance.\nOur continued success will depend on our ability to retain our key employees and to attract and retain new qualified employees, while controlling our labor costs.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational, sales and other personnel, while at the same time controlling our labor costs. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry and from other industries. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel, including sales force employees with key customer relationships, may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. Our senior management team has approximately 150 years of combined experience in manufacturing, distribution, retail and homebuilding, and has been integral to our successful acquisition and integration of businesses to gain scale in our current markets. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other experienced, senior employees or sales force employees could impair our ability to execute our business plan, cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages, labor relations or healthcare benefits, and health and other insurance costs. In addition, we compete with other companies for many of our employees in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. If we are unable to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, it could adversely impact our operating results.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers or failure to develop relationships with qualified suppliers, and our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers could affect our financial health.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the United States and the world), suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAlthough in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Many of our suppliers also offer us favorable terms based on the volume of our purchases. If market conditions change, suppliers may stop offering us favorable terms. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on favorable terms, commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our operating margins or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nA portion of the workforces of many of our suppliers, particularly our foreign suppliers, are represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes at these suppliers may result in work stoppages or slowdowns. Such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on these suppliers ability to continue meeting our needs.\nThe implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.\nWe have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our employees to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected purchasing experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In the event that we grow very rapidly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep up, expand or adapt our IT infrastructure to meet evolving demand on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether.\nWe occupy most of our facilities under long-term non-cancellable leases. We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we are still obligated under the applicable lease.\nMost of our facilities are located in leased premises. Many of our current leases are non-cancellable and typically have initial terms ranging from five to ten years and most provide options to renew for specified periods of time. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancellable and have similar renewal options. If we close or idle a facility, most likely we remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent, insurance, taxes and other expenses on the leased property for the balance of the lease term. The inability to terminate leases when idling a facility or exiting a geographic market can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a facility, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our facility leases, we may close or relocate a facility, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, we may not be able to secure a replacement facility in a location that is as commercially viable, including access to rail service, as the lease we are unable to renew. For example, closing a facility, even during the time of relocation, will reduce the sales that the facility would have contributed to our revenues. Additionally, the revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated facility may not equal the revenue and profit generated at the existing one.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as our sales volume increases or material prices fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured and prefabricated products. We must maintain, and have adequate working capital to purchase, sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Due to the lead times required by our suppliers, we order products in advance of expected sales. This requires us to forecast our sales and purchase accordingly. In periods of growth, it can be especially difficult to forecast sales accurately. We must also manage our working capital to fund our inventory purchases. Excessive spikes in the market prices of certain building products, such as lumber, can put negative pressure on our operating cash flows by requiring us to invest more in inventory. In the future, if we are unable to manage effectively our inventory and working capital as we attempt to grow our business, our cash flows may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe majority of our net sales are credit sales that are made primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry and geographic areas in which they operate, and the failure to collect or timely collect monies owed from customers could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe majority of our net sales volume in fiscal 2014 was facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry in the areas where they operate. We offer credit to customers, either through unsecured credit that is based solely upon the creditworthiness of the customer, or secured credit for materials sold for a specific job where the security lies in lien rights associated with the material going into the job. The type of credit offered depends both on the financial strength of the customer and the nature of the business in which the customer is involved. End users,\nresellers and other non-contractor customers generally purchase more on unsecured credit than secured credit. The inability of our customers to pay off their credit lines in a timely manner, or at all, would adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, our collections efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers could negatively impact our customer relations going forward.\nBecause we depend on the creditworthiness of certain of our customers, if the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risk could increase. Significant contraction in our markets, coupled with tightened credit availability and financial institution underwriting standards, could adversely affect certain of our customers. Should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy as has occurred in the past, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, bad debt reserves and net income.\nWe are subject to competitive pricing pressure from our customers.\nProduction homebuilders historically have exerted significant pressure on their outside suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share and ability to leverage such market share in the highly fragmented building products supply and services industry. The housing industry downturn resulted in significantly increased pricing pressures from production homebuilders and other customers. These pricing pressures have adversely affected our operating results and cash flows. In addition, continued consolidation among homebuilders, and changes in homebuilders\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices, could result in additional pricing pressure. Moreover, during the housing downturn, several of our homebuilder customers defaulted on amounts owed to us or extended their payable days as a result of their financial condition. If such payment failures or delays were to recur, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.\nIt is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations, needs and weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. For example, an increased consumer focus on making homes energy efficient could require us to offer more energy efficient building materials and there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify appropriate suppliers on acceptable terms. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and building product needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions and opening new facilities.\nOur long-term business plan provides for continued growth through strategic acquisitions and organic growth through the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities. Failure to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates on appropriate terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy. Moreover, our reduced operating results during the housing downturn, our liquidity position or the requirements of our Secured Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") could prevent us from obtaining the capital required to effect new acquisitions or expansions of existing facilities. Our failure to make successful acquisitions or to build or expand facilities, including manufacturing facilities, produce saleable product or meet customer demand in a timely manner could result in damage to or loss of customer relationships, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, we may not be able to integrate the operations of future acquired businesses in an efficient and cost-effective manner or without significant disruption to our existing operations. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties as to the future financial performance of the acquired business, difficulties integrating acquired personnel and corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers, difficulties in integrating different computer and accounting systems, exposure to unknown or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations. We may be unable to successfully complete potential acquisitions due to multiple factors, such as issues related to regulatory review of the proposed transactions. We may also be required to incur additional debt in order to consummate acquisitions in the future, which debt may be substantial and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations. Our failure to integrate future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other consequences of our acquisitions, including increased indebtedness, could prevent us from remaining competitive and, ultimately, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFederal, state, local and other regulations could impose substantial costs and/or restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and other regulations, including, among other things, regulations promulgated by the DOT, work safety regulations promulgated by OSHA, employment regulations promulgated by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the United States Department of Labor, federal and state environmental regulations, accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or similar entities, and state and local zoning restrictions, building codes and contractors\u2019 licensing regulations. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our business could expose us to litigation and/or substantial penalties that could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT. The DOT has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which, if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, may increase our selling, general and administrative expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. If we fail to comply adequately with DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations or we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the homebuilding industry is subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, energy conservation, environmental protection and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements on our business or that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, which could negatively affect our sales and earnings.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers could affect our financial health.\nOur ten largest customers generated approximately 20.8% and 20.7% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historical levels. Due to the weak housing market over the past several years in comparison to long-term averages, many of our homebuilder customers substantially reduced their construction activity. Some homebuilder customers exited or severely curtailed building activity in certain of our markets.\nIn addition, production homebuilders and other customers may: (i) seek to purchase some of the products that we currently sell directly from manufacturers; (ii) elect to establish their own building products manufacturing and distribution facilities or (iii) give advantages to manufacturing or distribution intermediaries in which they have an economic stake. Continued consolidation among production homebuilders could also result in a loss of some of our present customers to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, our customers typically are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. The contracts into which we have entered with most of our professional customers typically provide that we supply particular products or services for a certain period of time when and if ordered by the customer. Should our customers purchase our products in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past, such decreased purchases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may have future capital needs that require us to incur additional debt and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOn June 30, 2009, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, which includes a revolving line of credit (the \"Revolver\"). The Credit Agreement has subsequently been amended twelve times. The Revolver has a maximum availability of $200 million, subject to an asset borrowing formula based on eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables, inventory and fixed assets.\nWe are substantially reliant on liquidity provided by our Credit Agreement and cash on hand to provide working capital and fund our operations. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are likely to grow as the housing market improves and we execute our strategic growth plan. Economic and credit market conditions, the performance of the homebuilding industry, and our financial performance, as well as other factors, may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure additional financing,\nif available, and to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The prolonged continuation or worsening of current housing market conditions and the macroeconomic factors that affect our industry could require us to seek additional capital and have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure such capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may be unable to secure additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, including collateralized debt, subject to the restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various financial covenants that could limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00:1:00, as defined therein. However, the covenant is only applicable if the sum of availability under the Revolver plus Qualified Cash (which includes cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts or securities accounts or any combination thereof that are subject to a control agreement) falls below $20 million at any time, and remains in effect until the sum of availability under the Revolver plus Qualified Cash exceeds $20 million for 30 consecutive days. While there can be no assurances, based upon our forecast, we do not expect the covenant to become applicable during the year ending December 31, 2015. If the covenant was to become applicable and we were unable to satisfy it, we would evaluate our liquidity options including amending the Credit Agreement, seeking alternative financing arrangements of debt and/or equity and/or selling assets. No assurances can be given that such alternative financing would be available, or if available, under terms similar to our existing Credit Agreement or that we would be able to sell assets on a timely basis.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our IT systems.\nOur operations are dependent upon our IT systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. Our ERP system, which we use for operations representing virtually all of our sales, is a proprietary system that has been highly customized by our computer programmers. Our centralized financial reporting system currently draws data from our ERP system. We rely upon such IT systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis and to coordinate our sales and distribution activities across all of our products and services. A substantial disruption in our IT systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, computer viruses, unauthorized access or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by any natural or man-made disruptions to our distribution and manufacturing facilities.\nWe currently maintain a broad network of distribution and manufacturing facilities throughout the eastern, southern and western United States. Any widespread disruption to our facilities resulting from fire, earthquake, weather-related events, an act of terrorism or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers. We could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility. In addition, any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost increases could disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers. Disruptions to the national or local transportation infrastructure systems including those related to a domestic terrorist attack may also affect our ability to keep our operations and services functioning properly. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to exposure to environmental liabilities and are subject to environmental regulation.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances, rules and regulations including those promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and analogous state agencies. As current and former owners, lessees and operators of real property, we can be held liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination at or from such properties, in some circumstances irrespective of whether we knew of or caused such contamination. No assurance can be provided that investigation and remediation will not be required in the future as a result of spills or releases of petroleum products or hazardous\nsubstances, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions, more stringent standards regarding existing contamination, or changes in legislation, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement. More burdensome environmental regulatory requirements may increase our costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs systems and a website that allow for the secure storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. Our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts and cyber- or phishing-attacks. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity. As cyber-attacks become more sophisticated generally, and as we implement changes giving customers greater electronic access to our systems, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions and/or obtain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks, as we currently do not carry any such coverage. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and have taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nthe failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nmaterial litigation or government investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us, our principal stockholder or members of our management team;\n\u2022\nthe granting or exercise of employee stock options;\n\u2022\npayment of liabilities for which we are self-insured;\n\u2022\nvolume of trading in our common stock;\n\u2022\nthreats to, or impairments of, our intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of the factors described elsewhere in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has regularly experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nThe requirements of being a public company have increased certain of our costs and require significant management focus.\nAs a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses associated with compliance-related and other activities have increased. For example, in connection with our IPO, and thereafter in order to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ, we created new board of directors (\"Board\") committees and appointed multiple independent directors. Costs to obtain director and officer liability insurance have contributed to our increased costs. As a result of the associated liability, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board or as executive officers. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase our compliance costs.\nWe are currently in a phase-in period for complying with certain corporate governance requirements after ceasing to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, you will not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements until the applicable phase-in period expires.\nGores Holdings, an affiliate of Gores, held a majority of our common stock until March 18, 2014. As a result, we were considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the listing requirements of the NASDAQ until that date. Under these rules, we were not required to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ, including the requirements that a majority of the members of our Board meet the standard of independence established by those corporate governance requirements and that our Compensation Committee and our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee be comprised solely of independent directors. The independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We ceased to be a controlled company as of March 18, 2014 and will be required to comply with all of the NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements on or before March 18, 2015. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements until that date.\nGores Holdings continues to have significant influence over us, including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions.\nGores Holdings and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 37.9% of our outstanding common stock as of February 22, 2015. In addition, Gores Holdings has a contractual right to designate a number of directors proportionate to its stock ownership. As a result of its ownership and contractual rights, Gores Holdings (and indirectly, Gores, given its control of Gores Holdings), has the ability to strongly influence the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through our Board, the ability to influence decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies.\nMatters over which Gores Holdings (and indirectly, Gores, given its control of Gores Holdings) can exercise influence include:\n\u2022\nelection of directors;\n\u2022\nmergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transactions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares;\n\u2022\nother acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;\n\u2022\nincurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities;\n\u2022\nrepurchase of stock and payment of dividends; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of shares to management under the Stock Building Supply Holdings, Inc. 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (\"2013 Incentive Plan\").\nConflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are affiliated with our largest stockholder.\nMessrs. Freedman, Eisner, Page and Yager, who are officers or employees of Gores or its affiliates, serve on our Board. Gores controls Gores Holdings, our largest stockholder. Gores or its affiliates may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, and companies in which it or one of its affiliates is an investor or may invest in the future may begin competing with us or become customers of or vendors to the Company. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts between the interests of Gores, on the one hand, and of our other stockholders, on the other hand, arise, these directors may not be disinterested. Although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (i) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our Board and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction, (ii) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders\napprove the transaction or (iii) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any principal, officer, member, manager and/or employee of Gores or any entity that controls, is controlled by or under common control with Gores or any investment funds managed by Gores will not be required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain future earnings to fund our growth. In addition, our existing indebtedness restricts, and we anticipate our future indebtedness may restrict, our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, you may not receive a return on your investment in our common stock by receiving a payment of dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. As of February 22, 2015, there were 26,176,056 shares of our common stock outstanding. Our affiliates own as many as 11,400,292 of these shares, with approximately 9,931,617 of these shares beneficially owned by affiliates of Gores. The substantial majority of the shares beneficially owned by our pre-IPO investors were registered for resale pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on September 2, 2014. Gores\u2019 affiliates have the right to require us to register their remaining shares for resale, and certain of our other pre-IPO stockholders have the right to include their remaining shares in any such registration. Sales by such Gores\u2019 affiliates or our other pre-IPO stockholders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe also have 875,163 registered shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2013 Incentive Plan as of February 22, 2015, not including shares underlying outstanding stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). In addition, as of February 22, 2015, there were issued and outstanding approximately (i) 83,940 shares of nonvested stock, (ii) 16,124 RSUs that convert into common stock upon vesting, and (iii) 811,834 options for the purchase of common stock under the 2013 Incentive Plan. Upon vesting, conversion or exercise as applicable, such registered shares can be freely sold in the public market. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly and our current operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results could affect our stock price in the future.\nOur revenues and operating results have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of future performance.\nFactors associated with our industry, the operation of our business and the markets for our products and services may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nthe seasonal and cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry;\n\u2022\nthe highly competitive nature of our industry;\n\u2022\nthe volatility of prices, availability and affordability of raw materials, including lumber, wood products and other building products;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled and technical labor, increased labor costs and labor disruptions;\n\u2022\nthe production schedules of our customers;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, including but not limited to housing starts, repair and remodeling activity and light commercial construction, inventory levels of new and existing homes for sale, foreclosure rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, relative currency values, mortgage availability and pricing, as well as other consumer financing mechanisms, that ultimately affect demand for our products;\n\u2022\nactions of suppliers, customers and competitors, including merger and acquisition activities, plant closures and financial failures;\n\u2022\nlitigation, claims and investigations involving the Company;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022\ncost of compliance with government laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nweather patterns; and\n\u2022\nsevere weather phenomena such as drought, hurricanes, tornadoes and fire.\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results, including fluctuations in our key metrics. The variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and other contractual provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage hostile takeover attempts.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. The provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\na classified Board with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our Board or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nallowing only our Board to fill vacancies on our Board; and\n\u2022\nsuper-majority voting requirements to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, we have entered into a Director Nomination Agreement with Gores Holdings that provides Gores Holdings the right to designate nominees for election to our Board for so long as Gores Holdings beneficially owns 10% or more of the total number of shares of our common stock then outstanding.\nWe have elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203, except that they provide that Gores Holdings, its affiliates (including any investment funds managed by Gores) and any person that becomes an interested stockholder as a result of a transfer of 5% or more of our voting stock by the forgoing persons to such person are excluded from the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d definition in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and are therefore not subject to the restrictions set forth therein that have the same effect as Section 203.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nAny issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur Board has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote\nor action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nOur internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAs a relatively new public company we may lose research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If we lose securities or industry analyst coverage of our Company, the trading price for our stock may be negatively impacted. If we maintain or obtain new or additional securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 76796, "SIC": 5211, "TIC": "BMCH"}
