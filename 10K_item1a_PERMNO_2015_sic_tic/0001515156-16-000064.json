{"cik": "1515156", "company": "Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe following risks relate to our business as of the date of this Report, or any alternative date specified. This list of risks is not intended to be exhaustive, but reflects what we believe are the material risks inherent in our business and the ownership of our securities as of the specified dates. A statement to the effect that the happening of a specified event may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, profitability, financial condition, or the like, is intended to reflect the fact that such an event would be likely to have a negative impact on your investment in the Company, but should not imply the likelihood of the occurrence of such specified event. The order in which the following risk factors are presented is not intended as an indication of the relative seriousness of any given risk.\nDEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE FUTURE OF SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR GRANTING OF EXTENSIONS OF COMPLIANCE DEADLINES HAS HAD, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nA significant market driver for our existing products and services, and those planned in the future, are present and expected environmental laws and regulations, particularly those addressing the reduction of mercury and other emissions from coal-fired power plants. If such laws and regulations are delayed or are not enacted or are repealed or amended to be less strict, or include prolonged phase-in periods, or not enforced, our business would be adversely affected by declining demand for such products and services. For example:\n\u2022\nThe implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the EPA has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to do so.\n\u2022\nTo the extent federal, state, and local legislation mandating that electric power generating companies serving a state or region purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal, and such amount lessens demand for electricity from coal-fired plants, those mandates would likely reduce demand for our products and services.\nFederal, state, and international laws or regulations addressing emissions from coal-fired facilities, climate change or other actions to limit emissions including public opposition to new coal power plants, has caused and could continue to cause electricity generators to transition from coal to other fuel and power sources, such as natural gas, nuclear, wind, hydroelectric and solar. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations or public pressure will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the periods over which those laws or regulations are or will be phased in, the amount of public opposition, and the state and cost of commercial development of related technologies and processes. In addition, Public Utility Commissions may not allow utilities to charge consumers for and pass on the cost of emission control technologies without federal or state mandate. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, we cannot reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations or public opposition may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nTHE ABILITY OF CCS TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM THE SALE OR LEASE OF RC FACILITIES TO INVESTORS IS NOT ASSURED, AND THE INABILITY TO SELL, LEASE OR OPERATE RC FACILITIES TO GENERATE SECTION 45 TAX CREDITS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY.\nExcept for RC facilities that CCS may retain and operate permanently for its own account, CCS is attempting to sell or lease the remaining RC facilities to investors. The inability of CCS to successfully lease or sell additional RC facilities, or RC facilities that may be returned to CCS over time, to third party investors who will receive the benefit of the Section 45 tax credits that it expects to generate from those RC facilities would likely have an adverse effect on future growth and profitability.\nFurthermore, if in the future electric power generators decide to limit coal-fired generation for economic reasons and/or not to burn and use RC and instead switch to another power or fuel source, CCS would likely be unable to fully generate the Section 45 tax credits potentially available from RC facilities over the anticipated term of the Section 45 tax credit program. In\naddition, pursuant to CCS\u2019s Operating Agreement, if CCS is unable to generate enough revenue through the sale or lease of RC facilities over the next eight years to return the unrecovered investment balance, on an investment in CCS of $60 million made by GSFS, an affiliate of GS, plus a 15% annual return thereon, then GSFS may require CCS to redeem its interest in CCS for any deficit of such amount not distributed to GSFS. As of December 31, 2014, the unrecovered investment balance, inclusive of the 15% annual return was $45.5 million, as shown in the CCS Consolidated Financial Statements, included within Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nMARKET UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE LACK OF GUIDANCE AND RULINGS ISSUED BY COURTS AND THE IRS COULD INHIBIT CCS's ABILITY TO LEASE OR SELL ADDITIONAL RC FACILITIES OR REQUIRE A RESTRUCTURING OF, OR RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF, EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS.\nThe availability of Section 45 tax credits to taxpayers investing in RC facilities depends upon a number of factors, including the risk assumed by the taxpayer in the RC facility investment transaction. The law addressing when a taxpayer may and may not avail itself of Section 45 tax credits is not fully developed and is subject to rulings by courts, interpretations by the IRS and other official pronouncements on tax credit regulations. If rulings, guidance or other pronouncements of courts or the IRS are lacking or are interpreted as allowing the IRS to restrict availability, increase the difficulty, or prohibit or limit the ability of taxpayers to take advantage of Section 45 tax credits, several aspects of our current and future RC business could be adversely impacted. For example, current investors in RC facilities may decide to terminate their existing agreements or potential investors may reduce the price they are willing to pay or change the structure of the investment to account for perceived risks associated with Section 45 tax credits. Finally, for four years after an RC facility is placed in service it is eligible to generate Section 45 tax credits referred to as \u201cspecified credits\u201d which are attractive to individual taxpayers. Since the time period to generate specified credits passed at the end of December 2015, individual taxpayers may no longer participate in the market and the size of the pool of taxpayers wishing to lease or buy an RC facility may be reduced.\nTECHNICAL OR OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS WITH LONG-TERM OPERATION OF OUR RC FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND DELAYS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nThe initial RC facilities were operated using CyClean\u2122 technology at cyclone boilers. CCS began operating RC facilities using its M-45TM technology at circulating fluidized bed (\"CFB\") boilers in 2012 and pulverized coal (\"PC\") boilers in 2013. Given the different technology and boilers, the likelihood for technical or operational problems may be increased. Any such problems could result in decreased production of RC at such facilities and/or delays in, or postponement or cancellation of, expected potential future installations and operations at electric power generators and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPRESENT RELIANCE UPON ONE INVESTOR FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR EARNINGS FROM CCS AND ANY RENEGOTIATION BY OR LOSS OF THIS INVESTOR OR ANY FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE RC AT THE INVESTOR\u2019S RC FACILITIES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nAs of December 31, 2015, ten of CCS\u2019s 28 RC facilities are leased to entities related to affiliates of GS. A significant component of our total cash flows come from CCS distributions relating to these leases. These leases have an initial fixed period and then automatically renew, unless terminated at the option of the lessee, for successive one-year terms through 2019 or 2021. If these GS related entities renegotiated or terminated their leases or if the utilities where the RC facilities are installed materially reduce their use of RC, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nREDUCTION OF COAL CONSUMPTION BY U.S. ELECTRIC POWER GENERATORS COULD RESULT IN LESS DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF UTILITIES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS OR THE AMOUNT OF COAL BURNED, WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE SERVICES REQUIRED AT THE REMAINING PLANTS. THIS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe amount of coal consumed for U.S. electric power generation is affected by, among other things (1) the location, availability, quality and price of alternative energy sources for power generation, such as natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power; and (2) technological developments, including those related to alternative energy sources.\nNatural gas-fueled generation has been displacing and may continue to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. We expect that many of the new power plants needed to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by natural gas because the price of natural gas has remained at relatively low levels after a period of sharp decline, gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain as natural gas is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal-fueled generators, and ongoing costs associated with meeting environmental compliance are lower. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators could reduce the demand for our current products and services, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, long-term changes in environmental regulation that threaten or preclude the use of coal or other fossil fuels as a primary fuel source for electricity production, and result in the reduction or closure of a significant number of coal-fired power plants, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOUR DEPENDENCE ON THIRD PARTIES FOR MANUFACTURING KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR SYSTEMS MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN DELIVERIES, INCREASED WARRANTY CLAIMS, AND INCREASED COSTS TO US.\nBetween 2012 and 2015, we owned and controlled only one manufacturing and assembly facility for our DSI systems. In accordance with our previous disclosures, manufacturing and assembly operations at that facility, located in McKeesport, PA, were shut down at the end of 2015. Like most of our competitors, we currently rely heavily upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and some of the testing of key components, such as tanks, for our ACI systems and in the future will also rely on third parties for our DSI systems. Delays or difficulties in the manufacturing, assembly, or delivery of key components of our products could harm our business and financial condition.\nThere are limited sources of acceptable supply for some key ACI and DSI system components. Business disruptions, financial difficulties of third party suppliers or raw material shortages could increase the cost of our goods sold or reduce the availability of these components. Although the record high customer orders for ACI and DSI systems in 2013 and 2014 have decreased for 2015, the supplier marketplace continues to feel the impact of the rapid and substantial increase in the need for components and materials. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of required components that meet customer specifications in a timely manner, we could experience significant delays in delivery or increased warranty claims, associated with delivery and product performance. Similarly, as we shut down the McKeesport facility and outsource activities to third parties, any significant disruption could result in delays or customer claims. Disruptions of these types could result in the loss of orders or customers or liability for liquidated damages which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPENDING SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION AND DERIVATIVE ACTION COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT\u2019S FOCUS, RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTIGATION EXPENSES, AND HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOn May 1, 2014, we became the defendant in a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, where it is alleged that the Company violated federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements, among other things. At that time, Plaintiffs were seeking compensatory damages for alleged injuries incurred between March 14, 2013 and April 23, 2014. Plaintiffs amended their complaint on April 20, 2015 to extend the period for which they will seek damages to May 12, 2011 through January 23, 2015. On July 2, 2014, certain of our current and former executive officers and directors became defendants in stockholder derivative litigation alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, utilization of improper accounting techniques and failure to maintain effective internal controls that together resulted in materially inaccurate financial statements from which incentive compensation was derived and paid. This derivative action has been stayed until after certain matters in the class action lawsuit have been ruled on by the court. While we are defending both actions vigorously, the outcome of these actions or the court rulings may substantially harm our business. We have incurred significant legal expenditures in connection with these actions, and we are unable to predict the duration, scope, developments in, results of, or the consequences of the actions. The lawsuits could in the future result in the imposition of damages, additional civil lawsuits, interruptions of business, modification of business practices and equitable remedies against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. Because the matters are ongoing, we cannot assure you as to how the resulting consequences, if any, may impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We cannot currently estimate the potential liability, damages, or range of potential loss, if any, as a result of the legal proceedings. Furthermore, publicity surrounding these actions, even if ultimately resolved favorably for us, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIF THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DO NOT MEET OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 EXPECTATIONS, THEN OUR SALES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ULTIMATELY OUR REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.\nIf flaws in the design, production, assembly, delivery, installation or providing of our technologies, products or services (caused by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience substantial liquidated damages, repair, replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation. We have provided warranties and performance guarantees for certain ACI and DSI systems we have sold. Under those contractual arrangements we are responsible for repair or replacement costs and certain operating costs, within the limits provided by the contracts, if the agreed specifications are not met. Continued improvement in manufacturing capability assessment and quality control, technological development, supply-chain management, product testing, installation, delivery and other costs, are critical factors in our future growth and meeting our customers\u2019 expectations. Our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate technologies, designs and processes for the manufacture, installation and testing of our products may not be sufficient to avoid failures and meet performance criteria that may result in dissatisfied customers, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOUR BUSINESSES THAT ARE JOINT VENTURES ARE MANAGED VIA OPERATING AGREEMENTS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE SOLE CONTROL OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND WE CANNOT MANDATE DECISIONS OR ENSURE OUTCOMES.\nWe oversee our joint ventures via operating agreements and by participating in the following activities: (1) representation on the respective governing Boards, (2) regular oversight of financial and operational performance and controls and establishing audit and reporting requirements, (3) hiring of management personnel, (4) technical support of RC facilities, and (5) other regular and routine involvement with our joint venture partners. Notwithstanding this regular participation and oversight, our joint venture partners also participate in the management of these businesses and they may have business or economic interests that divert their attention from the joint venture or they may prefer to operate the business, make decisions or invest resources in a manner that is contrary to our preferences. Since material business decisions must be made jointly with our joint venture partners, we cannot mandate decisions or ensure outcomes.\nFAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY A THIRD PARTY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate because they provide only limited protection. We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, many of our customers, and many of our vendors and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Notwithstanding these precautions, a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology and intellectual property, which could result in injury to our business and financial condition. In addition, such actions would divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business.\nWE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE COSTLY TO DEFEND AND THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE THE DISPUTED TECHNOLOGIES.\nCompanies in the business of developing technology face the risk of being subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend. As a company regularly involved in developing and commercializing new technologies, we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from third parties, the defense of which would likely be costly in terms of monetary expenses and management demands. If our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from continuing sales of existing products or services and from pursuing research, development or commercialization of new products or services. Further, we may be required to obtain licenses to third party intellectual property, or be forced to develop or obtain alternative technologies. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require or to develop or obtain alternative technologies could significantly and negatively affect our business.\nWE HAVE AGREEMENTS TO INDEMNIFY THIRD PARTIES AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS CONCERNING LICENSED TECHNOLOGY AND OUR PRODUCTS THAT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.\nWe have agreed to indemnify licensees of our technologies (including CCS and Arch Coal, Inc.) and purchasers of our products and may enter into additional agreements with others under which we agree to indemnify and hold the third party harmless\nfrom and against losses it may incur as a result of the infringement of third party rights caused by the use of our technologies and products. Infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming to defend, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, even if we are successful in defending ourselves (and indemnified parties) against them.\nOUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ONGOING IDENTIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN AND DEPLOY NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES INTO THE MARKETPLACE EFFICIENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY.\nThe process of identifying customer needs, and developing and enhancing products, services and solutions for our various business segments is complex, costly and uncertain. Any failure by us to identify and anticipate changing needs, emerging trends and new regulations could significantly harm our future market share and results of operations. Historically, our approach to technology development, implementation and commercialization has focused on quickly taking technology to full-scale testing, and enhancing it under actual power plant operating conditions. We continue to review and adjust methods to deploy products, services and technologies to our customers. We may focus our resources on technologies, services or products that are not widely accepted or commercially viable, or on operational processes that that are not profitable even after significant up-front investment of our resources such as occurred with our previously disclosed decisions to shut down our Israel and McKeesport, PA investments. Our results are subject to risks related to our significant investments but if we are unable to develop and scale up new technologies, products, and services to meet the needs of our customers, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nAN INJURY TO OR DEATH OF ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LIABILITIES TO THE COMPANY.\nThe industrial activities conducted at our and our customer\u2019s facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with safety regulations. We may be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death, and our workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance policies may not be adequate or may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nTHE EFFECTS OF PROVIDING WARRANTIES AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES FOR EQUIPMENT OR CCS PROVIDING PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES OF ITS RC FACILITIES ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nProviding warranties that generally do not extend beyond 12 months from the installation date have been and will likely continue to be an integral part of successful sales of our products and services. Providing certain performance guarantees during a discrete performance testing period that generally do not extend beyond six months from the initial test date have been and will likely continue to be an integral part of successful sales of our products and services. Guarantees with respect to our ACI and DSI systems typically require the equipment to meet stated injection rates of a specified or approved absorbent or alkali material. In some cases, guarantees might require that emissions of certain pollutants (such as mercury) be reduced by a specified amount if certain operating parameters of the generating facility, including the nature of the coal burned, are met. Such guarantees generally require us to spend amounts up to the value of the sales contract to \u201cmake right\u201d the performance of the ACI or DSI system if the guaranteed level of performance is not achieved. In 2014 and 2015, our customers have sought stronger guarantees and remedies. Although we believe compliance with these stronger guarantees and remedies is probable, these stronger guarantees and remedies place us at greater risk. In addition to guarantees on ACI and DSI systems we sell, CCS indemnifies certain utilities and lessees of RC facilities for particular risks associated with the operations of certain facilities. We have provided limited joint and several guarantees of CCS\u2019s obligations under those leases. Any substantial payments made under such guarantees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS PURSUANT TO DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (\"DOE\") AUDITS OF OUR PAST PERFORMANCE COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nCertain of our completed and current contracts awarded by the DOE and related industry participants remain subject to government audits. Our historical experience with these audits has not resulted in significant adverse adjustments to amounts previously received; however audits for the years 2010 and later have not been finalized. If the results of future audits require us to repay material amounts, our results of operations and business would likely suffer material adverse impacts.\nCHANGES IN TAXATION RULES OR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nChanges in taxation rules and accounting pronouncements (and changes in interpretations of accounting pronouncements) have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in existing taxation rules, particularly those related to Section 45 tax credits or the ability of taxpayers to benefit from tax credits or Net Operation Losses (\"NOL\") or accounting standards could have an adverse effect on our reported or future results of operations or financial condition and could also impact our businesses that generate tax credits.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY VULNERABILITIES AND CYBERATTACKS ON OUR NETWORKS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nWe rely upon information technology to manage and conduct business, both internally and with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data, including in certain instances customer and supplier business information. Thus, maintaining the security of computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers, because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impact. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until long after being launched against a target so that we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our IT systems and security measures as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier, and other third party liabilities.\nWE HAVE MADE AND MAY MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR FORM PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.\nOur strategy may include expanding our scope of products and services organically or through selective acquisitions, investments or creating partnerships and joint ventures. We have acquired, and may selectively acquire, other businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms or we may be unable to integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively and efficiently and may need to divest those acquisitions as we did with our acquired operations in Israel and fabrication facility in McKeesport, PA. We continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including among others:\n\u2022\nIntegration difficulties including challenges and costs associated with implementing systems and processes to comply with requirements of being part of a publicly traded company;\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities or operating challenges;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to properly establish and maintain effective internal controls over an acquired company; and\n\u2022\nincreasing demands on our operational and information technology systems.\nAlthough we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of acquisitions we have made, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding their actual operating and financial condition. Until we actually assume operating control of these acquisitions, we may not be able to ascertain their actual value, costs or exposures to liabilities. This is particularly true with respect to acquisitions outside the United States.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our loan agreements contains certain covenants that limit, or that may have the effect of limiting, among other things acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nCUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL OR DELAY PROJECTS AND OUR BACKLOG MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF OUR FUTURE REVENUE.\nCustomers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control. Our orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit us to recover our costs, and, for most contracts, a portion of our anticipated profit if a customer cancels an order. If a customer cancels an order, we have to recognize our costs and revenues immediately and may not achieve the full amount of our backlog. If projects are delayed, the timing to recognize our revenues, particularly when using the completed contract method of accounting, will be adversely impacted and projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Revenue recognition can occur over long periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays and quarterly fluctuations which may also impact quarterly backlog. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues.\nOUR SHORT-TERM LOAN AGREEMENT MATURES ON APRIL 22, 2016 AND ALLOWS OUR LENDERS TO REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF OUR DEBT AT A PREMIUM IF CERTAIN EVENTS, INCLUDING EVENTS OF DEFAULT OR A CHANGE OF CONTROL, OCCUR.\nOur short term loan agreement matures on April 22, 2016 and may become due earlier based on certain customary events requiring mandatory prepayment, including upon certain asset sales or receipts of certain types of cash proceeds outside the ordinary course of business, upon a change of control, and upon a default. Prepayments will, subject to certain exceptions, be required to be paid with a prepayment premium of 4% except in the case of a change of control, in which case the prepayment premium is 1%. One of the events of default is if the Company fails to file all periodic reports with the SEC by March 30, 2016. Despite the Company's best efforts, our ability to file periodic reports is also dependent on factors beyond our control. If we are unable to refinance or extend the loan or engage in other transactions to generate the necessary cash flow to pay our loan at maturity or due to a mandatory prepayment event, we may not have sufficient funds to pay such indebtedness, including prepayment penalties, and our lenders would be entitle to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets, to the extent permitted by the short term loan agreement and applicable law.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE RESTATEMENTS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (THE \u201cRESTATEMENT\u201d)\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS RELATING TO EVALUATIONS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIRED BY SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In August of 2012, management determined that the Company improperly classified certain equity interests included within the then consolidated CCS financial statements and that the Company should have also recognized a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. Management made this determination after consultation with the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, Audit Committee, independent registered public accounting firm and outside tax experts. As a result of these determinations, in October of 2012, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 and the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012.\nAs previously disclosed, since April 2014, the Company has been engaged in an ongoing accounting review and in November 2014, management determined that the Company\u2019s investment in CCS should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as opposed to CCS being consolidated in the Company\u2019s financial statements. Management made this determination based on a review of accounting guidance related to Variable Interest Entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) and the specific facts and circumstances related to our investment in CCS.\nThe accounting review also identified matters impacting the restatement such as adjustments related to equity method accounting, revenue recognition, settlement and royalty indemnity accounting, stock based compensation and other adjustments, as further described in Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAs a result of these matters, the Company is restating its selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 and 2012, its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, and the unaudited quarterly financial information for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, and September 30, 2013.\nManagement determined that the issues leading to the restatements arose because of material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a control deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has taken steps to remediate the material weaknesses that it identified, but as of the date of this filing, the remediation of these material weaknesses is ongoing.\nFailure to comply with Section 404 or the identification of any further, or un-remediated, material weakness may cause our financial statements to be inaccurate, investors to lose confidence in our financial statements, and our stock price to be adversely affected. In addition, we may be subject to additional stockholder litigation, additional increases in insurance costs, and more limited access to the capital markets, and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nAUDIT, INVESTIGATION, AND LEGAL AND EXPERT SERVICES REGARDING THE RE-AUDIT, RESTATEMENT AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS HAS REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND HAS DIVERTED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE COMPANY AND MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AWAY FROM OUR USUAL BUSINESS OPERATION AND MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nIn March 2014, the Company, under the oversight of our Audit Committee with the assistance of outside counsel, began an internal investigation into accounting matters related to the Re-audit and Restatement. The internal investigation is currently aligned with our efforts to cooperate with the SEC Inquiry, as defined and described under Item 3 of this Form 10-K. Our Board of Directors, Audit Committee and members of management have devoted and expect to continue to devote substantial internal and external resources to investigation and cooperation with the SEC Inquiry, the Re-audit and Restatement processes, remediation efforts and the preparation and filing of this Form 10-K and future periodic reports. As a result of these efforts, we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant incremental fees and expenses for additional auditor services, financial and other consulting services and legal services, as well as the implementation and maintenance of systems and processes that will need to be updated, supplemented or replaced. These expenses, as well as the substantial time devoted by our Board and management towards identifying, addressing and remediating any internal weaknesses and legal costs related to investigation and related litigation, claims and other actions related to the Restatement, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWE ARE THE SUBJECT OF AN ONGOING SEC INVESTIGATION, WHICH HAS DIVERTED AND COULD CONTINUE TO DIVERT MANAGEMENT\u2019S FOCUS, RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTIGATION EXPENSES AND HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nAs a result of filing a 2014 Form 10-K and not filing a 2013 Form 10-K, current and prospective investors will be unable to review certain financial and informational disclosures that would have been contained in the full periodic reports that we did not file. As previously disclosed, our management and Audit Committee determined to restate our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2011 to 2012 and the first three quarters of 2013. Beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 through September 30, 2015, we did not file Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q. As a result, the Company was notified of the SEC Inquiry, described under Item 3 of this Form 10-K, on April 7, 2014. We are cooperating with the SEC and have incurred significant legal and accounting expenditures in connection with our internal investigation efforts and response to the SEC Inquiry. However, because we are filing a 2014 Form 10-K and not filing a 2013 Form 10-K, current and prospective investors will be unable to review certain financial and informational disclosures that would have been contained in the full periodic reports that we did not file and such reporting deficiencies may be considered by the SEC when assessing the Company\u2019s compliance with federal securities laws.\nWe are unable to predict how long the SEC Inquiry will continue or whether, at the conclusion of its investigation, the SEC will seek to impose fines or take other actions against us. Any action by the SEC could result in sanctions against us and/or certain of our current and former officers and directors. A protracted investigation could impose substantial additional costs and distractions, regardless of its outcome. Furthermore, publicity surrounding the foregoing or any enforcement action as a result of the SEC\u2019s investigation, even if ultimately resolved favorably for us, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nINABILITY TO PREPARE AND TIMELY FILE PERIODIC REPORTS LIMITS OUR ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC MARKETS TO RAISE DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL AND COULD RESULT IN INCREASED TRANSACTION COSTS.\nWe are required to comply with Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Beginning December 31, 2013 through September 30, 2015, we did not file Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10\u00adKs and Form 10-Qs. Because we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. Our limited ability to access the public markets could prevent us from implementing business strategies that we may otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. Until one year after the date we maintain compliance with our SEC reporting obligations, we will be ineligible to use shorter and less costly filings, such as Form S\u00ad-3, to register our securities for sale. We may use Form S-1 to register a sale of our stock to raise capital, but doing so would likely increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital in a timely manner.\nOUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MAY CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED.\nIf we do not receive sufficient royalty payments or distributions from CCS to repay the obligations of our short-term loan agreement while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements, we may need to extend or refinance the short-term loan or seek alternative sources of capital, under less favorable terms and conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOUR STOCK PRICE MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly. The market price of our common stock may be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nChanges in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nCCS\u2019s ability to lease or sell RC facilities;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of sales awards;\n\u2022\nChanges in supply and demand of components and materials;\n\u2022\nAdoption of new tax or accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nChanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nPerceptions of the value of corporate transactions; and\n\u2022\nThe degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions.\nFrom December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2015, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $3.70 to $29.00 per share (retroactively restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split of our common stock, which was effected in the form of a common stock dividend distributed on March 14, 2014). Significant declines in the price of our common stock could impede our ability to obtain additional capital, attract and retain qualified employees and reduce the liquidity of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of similarly staged companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nDELISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON NASDAQ AND QUOTATION ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD MAY CONTINUE TO DECREASE THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND PREVENT CERTAIN INVESTORS FROM INVESTING OR ACHIEVING A MEANINGFUL DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY.\nOn January 30, 2015, we received notification from the NASDAQ Capital Market informing us of their decision to suspend the trading of our common stock on the NASDAQ on February 3, 2015. Our common stock was finally delisted on March 30, 2015. As a result, our common stock is now quoted on the Over\u00ad the-Counter Bulletin Board (\"OTCBB\") or the \u201cpink sheets\u201d traded under the symbol \u201cADES.\u201d Based upon the fact that our common stock is no longer registered for trading on a national automated quotation system, and the value of the common stock held has decreased in value, there may be investment loss for stockholders or certain stockholders may no longer be permitted to invest in our common stock. Bid quotations on the OTCBB can be sporadic and may not provide any meaningful liquidity to investors. An investor may find it difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the common stock. As a result of these limitations, our common stock has fewer market makers, lower trading volumes and larger spreads between bid and asked prices than securities listed on a\nnational stock exchange or automated quotation system would typically have. These factors may result in higher price volatility and less market liquidity for our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock will be listed on a national exchange such as the NASDAQ Stock Market, the New York Stock Exchange, or another securities exchange once we become current in our filing obligations with the SEC.\nOUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MAY DELAY OR PREVENT AN OTHERWISE BENEFICIAL TAKEOVER ATTEMPT OF OUR COMPANY.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include provisions that:\n\u2022\nLimit the business at special meetings to the purpose stated in the notice of the meeting;\n\u2022\nAuthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that the board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting; and\n\u2022\nRequire the affirmative vote of the \u201cdisinterested\u201d holders of a majority of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d or its affiliates, unless either minimum price criteria and procedural requirements are met, or the transaction is approved by a majority of our \u201ccontinuing directors\u201d (known as \u201cfair price provisions\u201d).\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock, or could limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest. On February 1, 2015, we effected a stockholder rights plan that expires on February 1, 2016, as discussed in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.", "PERMNO": 90400, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ADES"}
