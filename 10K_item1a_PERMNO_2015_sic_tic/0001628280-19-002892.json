Risk factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business, important risk factors that may affect us are discussed below. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact or impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive. Many competitors in this industry are well-established, do a substantially greater amount of business and have greater financial resources and facilities than we do.\nWe have invested and continue to invest, substantial resources to develop and monetize our J-Plasma technology. If we are unable to gain acceptance in the marketplace of J-Plasma/Renuvion, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also compete by private labeling our products for major distributors under their label. This allows us to increase our position in the marketplace and thereby compete from two different approaches, our Apyx label and our customers\u2019 private label. Our private label customers distribute our products under their name through their internal sales force. We believe our main competitors do not private label their products.\nLastly, at this time, we sell the majority of our products through distributors. Many of the companies we compete with sell direct, thus competing directly with distributors they sometimes use.\nOur industry is highly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international regulatory authorities, as well as other governmental, state and federal agencies which have substantial authority to establish criteria which must be complied with in order for us to continue in operation.\nUnited States\nOur products and research and development activities are subject to regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following activities:\n\u2022Product development\n\u2022Product testing\n\u2022Product labeling\n\u2022Product storage\n\u2022Pre-market clearance or approval\n\u2022Advertising and promotion\n\u2022Product traceability and\n\u2022Product indications.\nIn the United States, medical devices are classified on the basis of control deemed necessary to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Most Class I devices are subject to general controls and exempt from Pre-Market Notification (510k)). These controls include registration and listing and adherence to the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements of the Quality System Regulation Labeling requirements. Most Class II devices are subject to the Pre-Market Notification ((510(k)) process as well as general and special controls that include performance testing (bench, animal and clinical in some cases), electrical safety testing, biocompatibility testing, sterilization and shelf-life testing, software testing, and system verification and validation testing. Class III devices are those which require a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) from the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, FDA has determined that general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by FDA.\nCurrently, we only manufacture Class I and Class II devices and all of our products are exempt from the PMA process. Our Class II devices require Pre-Market Notification [510k)]. A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\ndevice to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA. Submitters must compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support their substantial equivalence claims. Before marketing a device, each submitter must receive an order, in the form of a letter, from FDA which finds the device to be substantially equivalent (SE) and states that the device can be marketed in the U.S. This order \"clears\" the device for commercial distribution.\nInternational Regulation\nTo market products in the European Union, our products must bear the \u201cCE\u201d mark. Manufacturers of medical devices bearing the CE mark have gone through a conformity assessment process that assures that products are manufactured in compliance with a recognized quality system in the areas of design, development and manufacturing requirements and that they comply with the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD).\nEach device that bears a CE mark has associated technical documentation that includes a description of the following:\n\u2022Description of the device and its components,\n\u2022A Summary of how the device complies with the essential requirements of the medical devices directive,\n\u2022Safety (risk assessment) and performance of the device,\n\u2022Clinical evaluations with respect to the device,\n\u2022Methods, facilities and quality controls used to manufacture the device and\n\u2022Proposed labeling for the device.\nManufacturing and distribution of a device is subject to ongoing surveillance by the appropriate regulatory body to ensure continued compliance with quality system and reporting requirements.\nEach member country of the European Union maintains the right to impose additional regulatory requirements.\nThe European Union\u2019s (EU) Medical Device Regulation (MDR), officially passed in April 2017, represents the first major changes to the EU medical device regulatory environment in more than 20 years. The new EU MDR has significantly raised the compliance bar for the medical device industry and will cause significant changes to the regulatory obligations of legal manufacturers, importers and distributors involved in the medical device distribution chain. Enforcement of this new regulation will transition in over the next three years. The EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is far more complex than the existing Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and it presents new challenges for manufacturers. Classification has changed for some product categories and strict new requirements have been imposed on clinical data, risk management, post-market surveillance, and supplier management. Specifically, these new requirements are related to post-market importation and distribution activities of medical devices in the European Economic Area (EEA). Until now, different European countries have interpreted and implemented the directive in different ways. By revising the directive, EU MDR will enforce:\n\u25aa\nStricter pre-market control of high-risk devices at an EU level\n\u25aa\nThe inclusion of certain aesthetic products which present the same characteristics and risk profile as equivalent medical devices\n\u25aa\nImproved transparency through the establishment of a comprehensive EU database of medical devices (Eudamed)\n\u25aa\nDevice traceability through the supply chain from its manufacturer through to the final user\n\u25aa\nThe reinforcement of the rules on clinical data and clinical studies on devices\n\u25aa\nManufacturers to collect data about the real-life use of their devices\n\u25aa\nImproved coordination between EU Member States\nOutside of the European Union, regulations vary significantly from country to country and are becoming increasingly stringent and country specific. Territories and countries around the world continue to develop their own unique regulatory requirements and these individual governments are passing laws that enforce these new regulations and also imposing fees to register products in their country. The time and effort required to obtain approval to market products may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States or the European Union. Certain European countries outside of the European Union and other countries in the world do not recognize the CE mark certification or FDA clearance and have their own regulatory requirements to register and sell products in these territories. We are required to meet regulatory requirements and obtain registrations for our products in all countries that have these regulatory requirements prior to selling our products in that country.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nEnvironmental Regulation\nThe medical device industry continues to be the subject of intense scrutiny and stringent regulation and the demand for green, sustainable products is rapidly increasing. There are increasing requirements for efficient and accurate processes for hazardous substance handling, supplier disclosures and regulatory reporting in order to comply with numerous global health and environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions, such as:\n\u25aa\nRestriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive. The objective of the RoHS Directive is the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment so they are not released into the environment during the product\u2019s life, and especially at the end of life should the product be disposed of in a landfill.\n\u25aa\nThe Packaging and Packing Waste Directive. Materials used in packaging have limited amounts of hazardous materials and are recoverable and recyclable.\n\u25aa\nREACH Regulation. This regulation is aimed at the control of chemicals in use and their effect on human health and the environment. REACH requires that all chemicals be registered with the European Chemicals Agency. Medical device manufacturers must have a documented inventory of the chemicals/substances they are using, ensure with their suppliers that chemicals they use or supply are formally assessed, and understand their responsibilities with regard to the regulatory requirements.\n\u25aa\nProposition 65, officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act protects the State of California\u2019s drinking water sources from being contaminated with chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and requires businesses to inform Californians about exposures to such chemicals. The new regulations impose major new requirements specific to label, sign, and shelf tag warnings for consumer products offered for sale in California, which apply to all units of the product manufactured after August 30, 2018.\n\u25aa\nHazardous Air Pollutants: Ethylene Oxide. Ethylene oxide is used to sterilize equipment and plastic devices that cannot be sterilized by steam or other methods, such as medical equipment. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is addressing ethylene oxide based on the results of the latest National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), which identified the chemical as a potential concern in several areas across the country. The EPA is taking steps to address emissions of ethylene oxide from some types of industrial facilities across the country. EPA will review Clean Air Act regulations for facilities that emit ethylene oxide to ensure that they protect the public from significant risk and gather additional information on industrial emissions of ethylene oxide, including where emissions occur, how those emissions can be controlled, and how current emission controls can be improved.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with competitive advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our research and development efforts rely upon investments and alliances and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or alliances will be successful.\nOur research and development activities are an essential component of our efforts to develop new and innovative products for introduction in the marketplace. New and improved products play a critical role in our sales growth. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products, such as our J-Plasma technology, and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and areas of development. Our research and development activities are primarily conducted internally and are expensed as incurred. These expenses include direct expenses for wages, materials and services associated with the development of our products net of any reimbursements from customers. Research and development expenses do not include any portion of general and administrative expenses. Our research and development activities are conducted at our Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria facilities. We expect to continue making future investments to enable us to develop and market new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing business. However, we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments in both facilities will be successful or that our new products will gain market acceptance, the failure of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nThe amount expended by us on research and development of our products during the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, totaled approximately $2.5 million, $1.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. During the past three years, we invested substantial resources in the development and marketing of our Advanced Energy product technology. We have not incurred any direct costs relating to environmental regulations or requirements. For 2019, we expect to invest approximately 10% to 15% of revenue for research and development activities.\nEven if we are successful in developing and obtaining approval for our new product candidates, there are various circumstances that could prevent the successful commercialization of the products.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend on a number of factors, any of which could delay or prevent commercialization, including:\n\u2022\nour product is determined to be ineffective or unsafe following approval and is removed from the market or we are required to perform additional research and development to further prove the safety and effectiveness of the product before re-entry into the market;\n\u2022\nthe regulatory approvals of our new products are delayed or we are required to conduct further research and development of our products prior to receiving regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to build a sales and marketing group to successfully launch and sell our new products;\n\u2022\nwe are required to allocate available funds to litigation matters;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to manufacture the quantity of product needed in accordance with current good manufacturing practices to meet market demand, or at all;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other products or technologies prevents or reduces market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nwe do not have and cannot obtain the intellectual property rights needed to manufacture or market our products without infringing on another company\u2019s patents; or\n\u2022\nwe are unsuccessful in defending against patent infringement or other intellectual property rights, claims that could be brought against us, our products or technologies;\nThe failure to successfully acquire or develop and commercialize new products will have a material and adverse effect on the future growth of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nOur international operations subject us to foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating in foreign countries.\nWe operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To date, we have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and as a result, we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses. We purchase goods and services in U.S. dollars and Euros. Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by satisfying foreign denominated expenditures with cash flows or assets denominated in the same currency therefore we are subject to some foreign currency fluctuation risk. Our currency value fluctuations were not material for 2018. In addition, political changes or instability throughout the world could adversely affect our business internationally.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies could significantly increase the cost of imported goods into the United States, which may materially reduce our sales or profitability.\nThe Trump administration and members of the U.S. Congress have made public statements indicating possible significant changes in U.S. trade policy and have taken certain actions that may impact U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States. Any changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \"trade wars,\" in increased costs for goods imported into the United States, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States. If these consequences are realized, the volume of economic activity in the United States, may be materially reduced. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect our sales volumes. Further, the realization of these matters may increase our cost of goods and, if those costs cannot be passed on to our customers, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil, gasoline and other commodities.\nWe use plastics and other petroleum-based materials along with precious metals contained in electronic components as raw materials in many of our products. Prices of oil and gasoline also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gasoline and precious metal prices are volatile and may increase, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of our customers we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset through other cost reductions, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and Sophia, Bulgaria and could be affected due to multiple weather risks, including risks to our Florida facility from hurricanes and similar phenomena.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida and Sophia, Bulgaria and could be affected by multiple weather risks. Most notably hurricanes in Clearwater, Florida. Although we carry property and casualty insurance and business interruption insurance, future possible disruptions of operations or damage to property, plant and equipment due to hurricanes or other weather risks could result in impaired production and affect our ability to meet our commitments to our customers and impair important business relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations and profitability. We do however maintain a backup generator at our Clearwater facility and a disaster recovery plan is in place to help mitigate this risk.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe manufacture the majority of our products at our Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria facilities. Components, Labor-intensive sub-assemblies, labor-intensive assemblies and sterilization services are out-sourced to third party manufacturers/services and produced to our specifications.\nWe are also dependent on OEM customers who have no legal obligation to purchase products from us. Should such customers fail to give us purchase orders for the product after development, our future business could be negatively affected. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that such customers will give sufficient high priority to our products. Finally, disagreements or disputes may arise between us and our customers, which could adversely affect production and sales of our products.\nWe rely on certain suppliers and manufacturers for raw materials and other products and are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of such products and services.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing could have a negative effect on our cost of sales and our ability to meet the demands of our customers. Inability to meet the demands of our customers could result in the loss of future sales.\nIn addition, the costs to manufacture our products depend in part on the market prices of the raw materials used to produce them. We may not be able to pass along to our customers all or a portion of our higher costs of raw materials due to competitive and marketing pressures, which could decrease our earnings and profitability.\nWe also have collaborative arrangements with three key foreign suppliers under which we request the development of certain items and components and we purchase them pursuant to purchase orders. Our purchase order commitments are never more than one year in duration and are supported by our sales forecasts. The majority of our raw materials are purchased from sole-source suppliers. While we believe we could ultimately procure other sources for these components, should we experience any significant disruptions in this key supply chain, there are no assurances that we could do so in a timely manner which could render us unable to meet the demands of our customers, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nWe have been issued 37 patents in the United States and 24 foreign patents. We have 14 pending patent applications in the United States and 8 pending foreign applications. Our intellectual property portfolio for our J-Plasma/Renuvion products continues to grow on an annual basis. We intend to continue to seek legal protection, primarily through patents, for our proprietary technology. Seeking patent protection is a lengthy and costly process and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any pending applications, or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad or strong to protect our proprietary technology. There is also no guarantee that any patents we hold will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the patent rights granted will provide competitive advantages to us. Our competitors have developed and may continue to develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. In addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAdverse outcomes in current or future legal disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights, subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties on terms that may not be reasonable or favorable to us, prevent us from manufacturing, importing or selling our products, or compel us to redesign our products to avoid infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property. As a result, our product offerings may be delayed and we may be unable to meet customers\u2019 requirements in a timely manner. Regardless of the merit of any related legal proceeding, we have incurred in the past and may be required to incur in the future substantial costs to prosecute, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Even in the absence of infringement by our products of third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, or litigation related to trade secrets, we have elected in the past and may in the future elect to enter into settlements to avoid the costs and risks of protracted litigation and the diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. However, if the terms of settlements entered into with certain of our competitors are not observed or enforced, we may suffer further costs and risks. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and resources or results of operations.\nOur ability to develop intellectual property depends in large part on hiring, retaining and motivating highly qualified design and engineering staff with the knowledge and technical competence to advance our technology and productivity goals. To protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, generally we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees, as well as with consultants and other parties. If these agreements prove inadequate or are breached, our remedies may not be sufficient to cover our losses.\nWe have been and may in the future become subject to litigation proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, and we are and may become subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including claims by current or former employees, distributors and competitors, and with respect to our products and product liability claims, lawsuits and proceedings.\nWe are involved in a number of legal actions relating to the use of our J-Plasma technology. The outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In the opinion of management, the Company has meritorious defenses, and such claims are adequately covered by insurance, or are not expected, individually or in\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nthe aggregate, to result in a material, adverse effect on our financial condition. However, in the event that damages exceed the aggregate coverage limits of our policy or if our insurance carriers disclaim coverage, we believe it is possible that costs associated with these claims could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flows.\nIntellectual Property Litigation or Trade Secrets\nWe have in the past, experienced certain allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights and use of trade secrets and may receive other such claims, with or without merit, in the future. Previously, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights have sometimes evolved into litigation against us and they may continue to do so in the future. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation. Although we believe we have had adequate defenses to these claims and that the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, there can be no assurances that we will prevail. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us, significantly reduce our cash resources and create a diversion of the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we could be prohibited from future sales of the allegedly infringing product or products, which could materially and adversely affect our future growth.\nOur business is subject to the potential for defects or failures associated with our products which could lead to recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity.\nManufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off-label uses or inadequate disclosure of product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. These problems could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and result in significant costs and negative publicity. Due to the strong name recognition of our brands,7 an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of our current regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals. We also may undertake voluntarily to recall products or temporarily shut down certain production lines based on internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. Any of the foregoing problems could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may, in the future, incur impairments to our long-lived assets.\nWe review long-lived assets for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may have been impaired. This circumstance exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In those cases an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the assets\u2019 carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Any impairment losses are not restored in the future if the fair value increases.\nOur valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in highly competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to a long-lived intangible asset, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may, in the future, identify deficiencies in controls over financial reporting.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, we have identified three material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWhile we are in the process of identifying and implementing remedial measures to address the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness, there can be no assurance that remediation will be fully completed in 2019 or that the remedial measures will prevent future control deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or we\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nidentify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, and to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC will likely be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol \u201cAPYX\u201d. The market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and announcements by us or by third parties may have a significant impact on our stock price. These announcements may include:\n\u2022our listing status on the The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC;\n\u2022our operating results falling below the expectations of public market analysts and investors;\n\u2022developments in our relationships with or developments affecting our major customers;\n\u2022negative regulatory action or regulatory non-approval with respect to our new products;\n\u2022government regulation, governmental investigations, or audits related to us or to our products;\n\u2022developments related to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors and\n\u2022changes in the position of securities analysts with respect to our stock.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for the medical technology sector companies and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, future sales by our security holders may lower the price of our common stock, which could result in losses to our stockholders. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the possibility of such sales occurring, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Substantially all of our common stock is freely tradable in the public market without restriction under the Securities Act, unless these shares are held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock and, even if we change that policy, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance operations and invest in our business. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.\nIf we change that policy and commence paying dividends, we will not be obligated to continue paying those dividends and our stockholders will not be guaranteed, or have contractual or other rights, to receive dividends. If we commence paying dividends in the future, our board of directors may decide, in its discretion, at any time, to decrease the amount of dividends, otherwise modify or repeal the dividend policy or discontinue entirely the payment of dividends. Under the Delaware law, our board of directors may not authorize the payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our statutory surplus.\nHistorically the low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares and their liquidity.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, our common stock has from time to time experienced low trading volume. Limited trading volume may subject our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for investors to sell shares at a price that is attractive to them.\nExercise of options issued by us will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAPYX MEDICAL CORPORATION\nAs of December 31, 2018, our outstanding stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants amounted to 3,480,701 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 10.3% of our outstanding common stock.\nThe exercise of some or all of our stock options will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol \u201cAPYX\u201d. The market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and announcements by us or by third parties may have a significant impact on our stock price. These announcements may include:\n\u2022our listing status on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC;\n\u2022our operating results falling below the expectations of public market analysts and investors;\n\u2022developments in our relationships with or developments affecting our major customers;\n\u2022negative regulatory action or regulatory non-approval with respect to our new products;\n\u2022government regulation, governmental investigations, or audits related to us or to our products;\n\u2022developments related to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors and\n\u2022changes in the position of securities analysts with respect to our stock.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for the medical technology sector companies and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, future sales by our security holders may lower the price of our common stock, which could result in losses to our stockholders. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the possibility of such sales occurring, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.
