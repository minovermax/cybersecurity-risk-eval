{"cik": "52795", "company": "ANIXTER INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following factors could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Although we have tried to discuss key factors, please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance.\nThe pendency of our agreement to be acquired by WESCO International, Inc. could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn January 10, 2020, we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we agreed to be acquired by WESCO International, Inc. (\"WESCO\"). Under the terms of the merger agreement, at closing, each share of Anixter common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) $70.00 in cash, without interest (subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement), (ii) 0.2397 shares of WESCO common stock (subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement) and (iii) 0.6356 depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of newly issued WESCO Series A fixed-rate reset cumulative perpetual preferred stock, $25,000 stated amount per whole preferred (subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement), in each case, less any applicable withholding taxes. See Note 13. \u201cSubsequent Event\u201d in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the exchange ratio is fixed for the common stock portion of the merger consideration and the market price of WESCO common stock has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, at the time of the special meeting of stockholders to approve the merger, our stockholders will not know or be able to determine the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the merger. After the merger, our stockholders will have lower ownership and voting interest in WESCO than they currently have in Anixter and will exercise less influence over management.\nThe announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruption in our business, including the potential loss or disruption of commercial relationships prior to the completion of the merger. For example, parties with which we do business may be uncertain as to the effects on them of the merger, including with respect to their current or future business relationships with us. These relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or consider entering into business relationships with other parties. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, cash flows and financial position. The announcement and pendency of the merger could also have a potential negative effect on our ability to retain management, sales and other key personnel.\nThe merger agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course of business pending consummation of the merger, but includes certain contractual restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger. These restrictions may prevent us from taking certain specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that may be beneficial to us. The merger agreement also contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the merger and that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of Anixter form making a favorable alternative transaction proposal. In addition, matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could divert their time and attention. We have also incurred, and will continue to incur, significant non-recurring costs in connection with the merger that we may be unable to recover. Further, the merger agreement requires us to pay a substantial termination fee to WESCO in certain circumstances.\nThe risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, many of which are not within our control. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. We cannot provide assurance that our pending merger with WESCO will be completed. Failure to complete the merger could also negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nTransactions like the merger are frequently the subject of litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that either our board of directors breached their respective fiduciary duties to their stockholders by entering into the merger agreement, by failing to obtain a greater value in the transaction for their stockholders or otherwise. We believe that any such litigation or proceedings would be without merit, but there can be no assurance that they will not be brought. Indeed, between December 9, 2019 and December 19, 2019, four lawsuits were filed by purported stockholders of Anixter in connection with the now-terminated merger agreement with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC. If litigation or other legal proceedings are brought against us or against our board in connection with the merger agreement, we will defend against it, but we might not be successful in doing so. An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial position, including through the possible diversion of either company\u2019s resources or distraction of key personnel.\nAll of the matters described above, alone or in combination, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The foregoing description of our pending acquisition by WESCO is not complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the registration statement on Form S-4, which contains a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the merger, filed by WESCO with the SEC on February 7, 2020. We urge you to read the registration statement on Form S-4 because it contains important information about the merger, including relevant risk factors.\nA change in sales strategy or financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our sales or earnings.\nMost of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on short notice for any reason. We currently source products from thousands of suppliers. However, approximately one-quarter of our annual dollar volume purchases are sourced from our five largest suppliers. If any of these suppliers changes its sales strategy to reduce its reliance on distribution channels, or decides to terminate its business relationship with us, our sales and earnings could be adversely affected until we are able to establish relationships with suppliers of comparable products. Although we believe our relationships with these key suppliers are good, they could change their strategies as a result of a change in control, expansion of their direct sales force, changes in the marketplace or other factors beyond our control, including a key supplier becoming financially distressed.\nWe have risks associated with the sale of nonconforming products and services.\nHistorically, we have experienced a small number of cases in which our vendors supplied us with products that did not conform to the agreed upon specifications without our knowledge. Additionally, we may inadvertently sell a product not suitable for a customer\u2019s application. We address this risk through our quality control processes, by seeking to limit liability and our warranty in our customer contracts, by obtaining indemnification rights from vendors and by maintaining insurance responsive to these risks. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to include protective provisions in all of our contracts, that vendors will have the financial capability to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us, or that insurance can be obtained with sufficiently broad coverage or in amounts sufficient to fully protect us.\nOur foreign operations are subject to political, economic, currency and other risks.\nWe derive approximately one quarter of our revenues from sales outside of the U.S. Economic and political conditions in some of these foreign markets may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in these foreign markets. Our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (as further discussed in \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\") and different legal, tax, accounting and regulatory requirements. In addition, some of the products that we distribute are produced in foreign countries, which involve longer and more complex supply chains that are vulnerable to numerous risks that could cause significant interruptions or delays in delivery of such products. Many of these factors are beyond our control and include risks, such as political instability, financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, labor disputes, currency fluctuations, changes in tariff or import policies, severe weather, public health crises, terrorist attacks and transport capacity and cost. For example, the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, a respiratory illness, in China, could adversely affect our supply chains involving China and other affected regions. The extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business, results of operation or financial condition is difficult to assess at this stage as much depends on future developments, which are uncertain, including information concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the methods to contain and treat the virus. A significant interruption in our supply chains caused by any of the above factors could result in increased costs or delivery delays and result in a decrease in our net sales and profitability.\nWe have risks associated with inventory.\nWe must identify the right product mix and maintain sufficient inventory on hand to meet customer orders. Failure to do so could adversely affect our sales and earnings. However, if circumstances change (for example, an unexpected shift in market demand, pricing or customer defaults) there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of our inventory. To guard against inventory obsolescence, we have negotiated various return rights and price protection agreements with certain key suppliers. We also maintain an inventory valuation reserve account against declines in the value or salability of our inventory. However, there is no guaranty that these arrangements will be sufficient to avoid write-offs in excess of our reserves in all circumstances.\nOur operating results are affected by copper prices.\nOur operating results have been affected by changes in prices of copper, which is a major component in a portion of the electrical wire and cable products we sell. As our purchase costs with suppliers change to reflect the changing copper prices, our percent mark-up to customers remains relatively constant, resulting in higher or lower sales revenue and gross profit depending upon whether copper prices are increasing or decreasing.\nWe have risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses.\nIn connection with recent and future acquisitions, it is necessary for us to continue to create an integrated business from the various acquired entities. This requires the establishment of a common management team to guide the acquired businesses, the conversion of numerous information systems to a common operating system, the establishment of a brand identity for the acquired businesses, the streamlining of the operating structure to optimize efficiency and customer service and a reassessment of the inventory and supplier base to ensure the availability of products at competitive prices. No assurance can be given that these various actions can be completed without disruption to the business, in a short period of time or that anticipated improvements in operating performance can be achieved. Any inability on our part to successfully implement strategic transactions could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. There can be no assurance that any businesses acquired will meet performance expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. In addition, any acquisition that we make may not deliver the synergies and other benefits that were anticipated when entering into such acquisition.\nOur debt agreements could impose restrictions on our business.\nOur debt agreements contain certain financial and operating covenants that limit our discretion with respect to certain business matters. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022create liens on assets;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022transfer, lease or dispose of assets; and\n\u2022engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or other fundamental changes.\nThese covenants also limit the amount of dividends or share repurchases we may make. As a result of these restrictions, we are limited in how we may conduct business and may be unable to compete effectively or take advantage of new business opportunities. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions or regulatory changes beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our revolving lines of credit or the indentures governing our outstanding notes that would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders, as the case may be, to declare all outstanding amounts to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay indebtedness, lenders having secured obligations, such as the lenders under our revolving lines of credit, could proceed against the collateral securing these obligations. This could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have substantial debt which could adversely affect our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities.\nAs of January 3, 2020, we had an aggregate principal amount of $1.06 billion of outstanding debt. As a result, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes. This may also limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and general corporate purposes in the future. Our indebtedness also reduces our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions or may prevent us from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations and strategic growth.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face liquidity problems and may be required to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or refinance our debt. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our debt agreements and the indentures governing our outstanding notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to consummate those dispositions, or if we do, what the timing of the dispositions will be or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet our debt service obligations when due.\nWe have risks associated with accounts receivable.\nA significant portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable. Although no single customer accounts for more than 3% of our sales, a payment default by one of our larger customers could have a negative short-term impact on earnings or liquidity. A financial or industry downturn could have an adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults.\nA decline in project volume could adversely affect our sales and earnings.\nWhile much of our sales and earnings are generated by comparatively smaller and more frequent orders, the fulfillment of large orders for capital projects generates significant sales and earnings. Slow macro-economic growth rates, difficult credit market conditions for our customers, weak demand for our customers\u2019 products or other customer spending constraints can result in project delays or cancellations, potentially having a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe level of returns on pension plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in government regulations could also affect our pension plan expenses and funding requirements.\nThe funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. At January 3, 2020, our projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $71.0 million.\nAssumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plans are determined by us in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, or mortality rates, our future pension benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions, the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.\nAny significant disruption, interruption or failure of our information systems could disrupt our business, result in increased costs and decreased revenues, harm our reputation, and expose us to liability.\nWe rely on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems to successfully operate our business, including managing inventory, processing customer orders, shipping products and providing service to customers, and compiling financial results. Our information systems may be disrupted due to natural disasters, power or telecommunications outages, unauthorized access, or other causes. Any significant or prolonged unavailability or failure of our critical information systems could materially impair our ability to maintain proper levels of inventories, process orders, meet the demands of our customers in a timely manner, and other harmful effects. We seek to continually enhance our information systems, and such changes could potentially create a disruption or failure of our existing information technology. Additionally, efforts to align portions of our business on common platforms, systems and processes could result in unforeseen interruptions, increased costs or liability, and other negative effects.\nWe may experience a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks, mailicious intrusions or information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. If our information systems are compromised, we may face regulatory sanctions or penalties under applicable laws, experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, information technology outages or disruptions, or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation.\nDisruptions to our logistics capability or supply chain may have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur global logistics services are operated through distribution centers around the world. We also depend on transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers. Any significant interruption or disruption in service at one or more of our distribution centers due to severe weather, natural disasters, information technology upgrades, operating issues, disruptions to our transportation network, public heath crises (such as the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus) or other unanticipated events, could impair our ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner, cause cancellations or delays in shipments to customers or otherwise disrupt our normal business operations.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations globally and any failure to comply could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate globally, including, among others, those relating to data privacy and protection, cyber security, import and export requirements, anti-bribery and corruption, product compliance, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, environmental protection, health and safety requirements, intellectual property, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, labor and employment, e-commerce, advertising and marketing, anti-competition and tax. Compliance with these domestic and foreign laws, regulations and requirements may be burdensome, increasing our cost of compliance and doing business. In addition, as a supplier to federal, state, and local government agencies, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to our governmental contracts. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, we cannot assure you that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations, or our policies and procedures. Any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, damage to our reputation, and, in the case of laws and regulations relating to governmental contracts, the loss of those contracts.\nWe may be adversely affected by the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) and their future relationship with other countries.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). This started a transition period that will last until at least December 31, 2020 during which time the United Kingdom remains in the European Economic Area, single market and customs union, and European Union laws continues to apply in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and European Union have made a non-binding political declaration setting out a framework for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after the transition period. Negotiations on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union have been and will likely continue to be complex and protracted. The United Kingdom will also negotiate its future trading relationship with other countries.\nWe have significant operations in the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. The withdrawal by the United Kingdom and its future trading relationships could have an adverse effect on the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The end of the transition period and the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. The uncertainty concerning the timing could also have a negative impact on the business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and the other economies in which we operate, which could result in customers reducing or delaying spending decisions on our products. Our United Kingdom business has deferred tax assets totaling $6.8 million. A downturn in our United Kingdom business caused by a material adverse effect could require us to record a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by unanticipated changes in our tax provisions.\nWe are a U.S.-owned multinational company subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and jurisdictions abroad. Tax laws are subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of laws are issued or applied. Such changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, regulations, other administrative guidance and common law interpretation could affect our tax expense and profitability as evidenced by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. Further, the final determination of tax audits or litigation could ultimately be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in our tax provision and tax liabilities, whether due to changes in law, the interpretation, or a final determination of audits or litigation, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 46077, "SIC": 5065, "TIC": "AXE"}
