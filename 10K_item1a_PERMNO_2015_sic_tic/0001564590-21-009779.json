{"cik": "863436", "company": "BENCHMARK ELECTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully when reviewing the Company\u2019s business, the forward-looking statements contained in this Report, and the other statements the Company or its representatives make from time to time. Any of the following factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and the actual results of the matters addressed by the forward-looking statements.\nOperational Risks\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of which is uncertain and difficult to predict. The widespread outbreak of any other health epidemics could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments, particularly in countries where we operate, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In late 2019, there was an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which has since spread globally. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Further, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in government authorities around the world implementing numerous measures to try to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, \u201cshelter-in-place,\u201d \u201cstay-at-home,\u201d total lock-down orders, business limitations or shutdowns and similar orders. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nBenchmark provides critical infrastructure products and essential services in each of our locations. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the related responses from government authorities, the Company\u2019s operations were impacted worldwide starting in the first quarter of 2020. For example, several of the Company\u2019s facilities worldwide, including in Suzhou, China, Penang, Malaysia, California, U.S. and Tijuana and Guadalajara, Mexico, were affected in 2020 by government enacted plant shut-downs, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place or similar restrictions, which resulted in reduced productivity levels throughout our facilities. Additionally, the Company experienced a challenging supply chain environment and labor constraints, as well as increased direct costs and under absorption of fixed costs, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information see \u201c-COVID-19 Pandemic Update\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Report.\nAdditionally, our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may be further impacted in several ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfurther disruptions to our operations, including due to additional facility closures, restrictions on our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts and/or interruptions to our engineering and design processes and other important business activities;\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our products and services, particularly due to disruptions to the businesses and operations of our customers;\n\u2022\ninterruptions, availability or delays in global shipping to transport our products;\n\u2022\nfurther slowdown or stoppage in the supply chain for our products, in addition to higher costs;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources and availability, including due to sickness, government restrictions, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people or mass transit disruptions, or a shortage of available vaccinations;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting customer receivables;\n\u2022\na fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could result from market uncertainties;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities;\n\u2022\nany breach of financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\ncurrent or near future trends may cause certain inventory to be slow-moving and trigger the need to review for excess and obsolete inventory or the valuation of inventory;\n\u2022\nchanges to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nan increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities, as well as negatively impact our stock price.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be enough to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The potential effects of COVID-19 may also impact many of our other risk factors discussed in this Report. The exact extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the availability of vaccinations and the rate of inoculations, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume which may not return fully to pre-pandemic levels.\nShortages or price increases of components specified by our customers would delay shipments and adversely affect our profitability.\nSubstantially all of our sales are derived from manufacturing services in which we purchase components specified by our customers. In the past, supply shortages have substantially curtailed production of all assemblies using a particular component and industry-wide shortages of electronic components, particularly of memory and logic devices, have occurred. For example, in 2011, we experienced disruptions to our global supply chain due to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as well as floods in Thailand. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in supply chain constraints for the Company. In some instances, such component shortages have resulted in delayed shipments. Because of the continued increase in demand for surface mount components, we anticipate component shortages and longer lead times for certain components to occur from time to time. Also, we may bear the risk of\ncomponent price increases that occur between periodic re-pricings of products during the term of a customer contract. Accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins.\nWe are dependent on the success of our customers and the markets in which they operate. When our customers or the markets in which they operate experience declines or grow at a significantly slower pace than anticipated, we may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. Our customers are OEMs of:\n\u2022\nindustrial equipment,\n\u2022\nequipment for the A&D industries;\n\u2022\ntelecommunication equipment;\n\u2022\ncomputers and related products for business enterprises;\n\u2022\nmedical devices; and\n\u2022\nsemi-cap equipment.\nThese markets are subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and consequent product obsolescence. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected. For example, the declines in demand throughout the broader semiconductor capital equipment market in 2018 and 2019 had a significant impact on us for those fiscal years.\nThe loss of a major customer would adversely affect us.\nA substantial percentage of our sales are made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us. Further, developments adverse to our major customers or their products, or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services, could have an adverse effect on us. Sales to our ten largest customers represented 41%, 38% and 44% of our sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to depend on sales to our largest customers, and any material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from these customers or other significant customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing services to our customers. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for the services provided by us, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nMost of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity.\nThe volume and timing of sales to our customers vary due to:\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for their products;\n\u2022\ntheir attempts to manage their inventory;\n\u2022\ndesign changes;\n\u2022\nchanges in their manufacturing strategies; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions of, or consolidations among, customers.\nDue in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have, in the past, failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 business needs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. On other occasions, our customers have required rapid increases in production, which have placed an excessive burden on our resources. Such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past, and may again in the future. A business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating income.\nWinning business is subject to lengthy, competitive bid selection processes that often require us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\nOur business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.\nOur customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategies.\nEMS providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we continue to experience reduced lead-times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy for a number of reasons. Cancellations, reductions, delays or changes in the sourcing strategy by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating income.\nIn addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs, capital expenditures and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products impede our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers.\nThe degree of success or failure of our customers\u2019 products in the market also affects our business. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results.\nWe may encounter significant delays or defaults in payments owed to us by customers for products we have manufactured or components that are unique to particular customers.\nWe structure our agreements with customers to mitigate our risks related to obsolete or unsold inventory. However, enforcement of these contracts may result in material expense and delay in payment for inventory. If any of our significant customers become unable or unwilling to purchase such inventory, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur financial results depend, in part, on our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding, timing and termination.\nWe provide services both as a prime contractor and subcontractor for the U.S. government. Consequently, a portion of our financial results depends on our performance under these contracts. Delays, cost overruns or product failures in connection with one or more contracts, could lead to their termination and negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of such a termination.\nU.S. government programs require congressional appropriations, which are typically made for a single fiscal year even though a program may extend over several years. Programs often are only partially funded, and additional funding requires further congressional appropriations. The programs in which we participate compete with other programs for consideration and funding during the budget and appropriations process, which can be impacted by shifting and often competing political priorities.\nOur government contracts often involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. New technologies used for these contracts may be untested or unproven and product requirements and specifications may be modified. Consequently, technological and other performance difficulties may cause delays, cost overruns or product failures. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the amounts we spend to develop new products or solutions to compete for a government contract will be recovered since we may not be awarded the contract.\nOur international operations are subject to certain risks.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, 52%, 47% and 45%, respectively, of our sales were from our international operations. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\npublic health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can result in varying impacts to our business, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and partners internationally as discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones;\n\u2022\nless flexible employee relationships, which complicate meeting demand fluctuations and can be difficult and expensive to terminate;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war), which could impact our ability to ship and/or receive product;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign or domestic government policies, regulatory requirements and laws, which could impact our business;\n\u2022\nlonger customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nexport duties, import controls, tariffs, and trade barriers (including quotas and border taxes);\n\u2022\ngovernmental restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nrisk of governmental expropriation of our property;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices, including various and changing minimum wage regulations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could affect foreign taxes due, component costs, local payroll, utility and other expenses; and\n\u2022\ninability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations which would increase our overall effective tax rate.\nChanges made that impact the way we operate internally could have a negative impact on us and reduce the demand for our foreign manufacturing facilities. Moreover, any retaliatory actions by other countries where we operate could also negatively impact our financial performance. In addition, changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to trade wars, changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries. Also, our current facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican Maquiladora (IMMEX) program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations. We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements. Additionally, increasing tariffs and other trade protection measures between the U.S. and China may affect the cost of our products originating in China as well as the demand for our products manufactured in China in the event our customers reduce operations in China as a result of such tariffs or trade protection measures. These actions could also affect the cost and/or availability of components that we procure from suppliers in China.\nIn addition, several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. Certain events, including natural disasters, can impact the infrastructure of a developing country more severely than they would impact the infrastructure of a developed country. A developing country can also take longer to recover from such events, which could lead to delays in our ability to resume full operations. These factors may harm our results of operations, and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective. In our experience, entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market development, hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable.\nCertain foreign jurisdictions, as well as the U.S. government, restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the U.S. or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our operations in the United States, we may incur penalties and/or taxes to repatriate these funds.\nAnother significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may\nbe a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA, other U.S. laws and regulations, or similar laws of host countries and related anti-bribery conventions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the FCPA and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents, or those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nStart-up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results and such costs may not be recoverable if the new programs or transferred programs are cancelled.\nStart-up costs, the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with the establishment of new programs and new customer relationships, and the need to estimate required resources in advance can adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life cycle of new products and new programs or program transfers and in the opening of new facilities. These factors also affect our ability to efficiently use labor and equipment. We are currently managing a number of new programs. If any of these new programs or new customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could be harmed, particularly in the short-term. We may not be able to recoup these start-up costs or replace anticipated new program revenues.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by natural disasters.\nSome of our facilities, including our corporate headquarters, are located in areas that may be impacted by hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters. For example, our facilities in Thailand experienced extensive flooding in 2011. Our insurance coverage for natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. This coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. See \u201cWe bear the risk of uninsured losses.\u201d\nIn addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack. If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical, or we may be unable, to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays. Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility with specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.\nWe bear the risk of uninsured losses.\nAs a result of extensive 2011 flooding in Thailand, we have been unable to obtain cost-effective flood insurance to adequately cover assets at our facilities in Thailand. We continue to monitor the insurance market in Thailand; however, we have made physical alterations to help mitigate a similar natural disaster. We maintain insurance on all our properties and operations for risks and in amounts customary in the industry. While such insurance includes general liability, property & casualty, and directors & officers liability coverage, not all losses are insured, and we retain certain risks of loss through deductibles, limits and self-retentions. In the event we experience a significant uninsured loss, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnergy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.\nSome of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our transportation activities. While significant uncertainty exists about the future levels of energy prices, a significant increase is possible. Increased energy prices could cause an increase in our raw material and transportation costs. In addition, increased costs of our suppliers or customers could be passed along to us, and we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset them. Moreover, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.\nIntroducing programs requiring implementation of new competencies, including new process technology within our mechanical operations, could affect our operations and financial results.\nThe introduction of programs requiring implementation of new competencies, including new process technology within our mechanical operations, presents challenges in addition to opportunities. Deployment of such programs may require us to invest significant resources and capital in facilities, equipment and/or personnel. We may not meet\nour customers\u2019 expectations or otherwise execute properly or in a cost-efficient manner, which could damage our customer relationships and result in remedial costs or the loss of our invested capital and anticipated revenues and profits. In addition, there are risks of market acceptance and product performance that could result in less demand than anticipated and our having excess capacity. The failure or inability to reflect the anticipated costs, risks and rewards of such an opportunity in our customer contracts could adversely affect our profitability. If we do not meet one or more of these challenges, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nCustomer relationships with start-up or emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies.\nCustomer relationships with start-up or emerging companies present special risks because these companies do not have an extensive product history. As a result, there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products, making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers. In addition, funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we plan or previously experienced. This tightening of financing for start-up customers, together with many start-up customers\u2019 lack of prior operations and unproven product markets increase our credit risk, especially in trade accounts receivable and inventories. Although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for all customers, including start-up customers and emerging companies, based on the information available, these allowances may not be adequate. This risk may exist for any new start-up or emerging company customers in the future.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry; if we are not able to compete effectively in the EMS industry, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe compete against many providers of electronics manufacturing services. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources than we do and have more geographically diversified international operations than we do. Our competitors include Celestica Inc., Flex Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Plexus Corp and Sanmina Corporation. In addition, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, electronics manufacturing services.\nWe also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and future customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to EMS providers. In addition, in recent years, ODMs that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs, have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in several markets, such as notebook and desktop computers, personal computer motherboards, and consumer electronic products. Competition from ODMs may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into or beyond these markets.\nDuring periods of recession in the electronics industry, our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronics OEMs, who may become more price sensitive. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures, particularly those with more offshore facilities located where labor and other costs are lower.\nThe availability of excess manufacturing capacity at many of our competitors creates intense pricing and competitive pressure on the EMS industry as a whole. To compete effectively, we must continue to provide technologically advanced manufacturing services, maintain strict quality standards, respond flexibly and rapidly to customers\u2019 design and schedule changes, deliver products globally on a reliable basis at competitive prices and seek to create enhanced relationships with our customers with our advanced technology and engineering solutions. Our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe may be affected by consolidation in the electronics industry, which could create increased pricing and competitive pressures on our business.\nConsolidation in the electronics industry could result in a decrease in manufacturing capacity as companies seek to close plants or take other steps to increase efficiencies and realize synergies of mergers, creating increased pricing and competitive pressures for the EMS industry as a whole and our business in particular. In addition, consolidation\ncould also result in an increasing number of very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics industry. The growth of these large companies, with significant purchasing and marketing power, could also result in increased pricing and competitive pressures for us. Accordingly, industry consolidation could harm our business. We may need to increase our efficiencies to compete and may incur additional restructuring charges.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Litigation Risks\nGovernment contracts are subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing, kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or debarment.\nLike all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties if we were to fail to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules or cost accounting standards, employ improper billing practices, receive or pay kickbacks or file false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by U.S. and foreign government agencies and authorities. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could result in progress payments being withheld, our suspension or debarment from future government contracts or harm to our business reputation.\nRegulatory, legislative or self-regulatory/standard developments regarding privacy and data security matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nU.S. privacy and data security laws apply to our various businesses. We also do business globally in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States that may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires us to protect the privacy of certain personal data of European Union (EU) citizens. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect January 1, 2020, has similar protections. While we have implemented processes and controls to comply with GDPR and CCPA requirements, we could incur significant fines, individual damages and reputational risks if our controls and processes are ineffective and we fail to comply.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax position, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes.\nSeveral countries where we operate allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained holidays or other incentives where available. Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives were retracted, or if they were not renewed upon expiration, such as the nonrenewal of our tax holiday in Malaysia in 2021, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions were otherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase. Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, changes to the manner in which U.S. based multinational companies are taxed in the U.S. could have a material impact on our financial results and competitiveness.\nAs a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform) enacted in December 2017, we incurred a net estimated tax expense of $93.3 million due to the one-time mandatory transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements of this Report for additional information.\nBased on the new executive branch administration in Washington D.C. and the new Congress for the calendar year of 2021, our effective tax rates and overall cash taxes may change in the future and could have an impact on our financial results.\nAny litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nIn the past, we have been notified of claims relating to various matters including intellectual property rights, contractual matters, labor issues or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of any such claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money and resources, even where the claim is without merit. Accordingly, the resolution of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes. If we or companies we acquire have failed or fail in the future to comply with such laws and regulations, then we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended. Such laws and regulations could also restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities, could require us to acquire costly equipment, or could impose other significant expenditures. In addition, our operations may give rise to claims of property contamination or human exposure to hazardous chemicals or conditions.\nOur worldwide operations are subject to local laws and regulations. Some of our operations are subject to various environmental laws and related regulations, including: the \u201cRoHS\u201d (EU Directive 2011/65/EC on Restriction of certain Hazardous Substances); \u201cWEEE\u201d (EU Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment); \u201cREACH\u201d (EC Regulation No 1907/2006 on Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals); EU Member States\u2019 Implementation of the foregoing; \u201cConflict Minerals\u201d as defined in the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \u00a7 1502(b), implementing legislation and rules; and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Management Methods for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products; and other environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose administrative burdens on and restrict the sourcing and distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.\nThese directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole. If we or our customers fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended.\nIn addition, as climate change concerns become more prevalent, the U.S. and foreign governments have sought to limit the effects of any such changes. This increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs or obligations in complying with any new environmental regulations and reporting requirements, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nIf our manufacturing processes and services do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims.\nWe predominantly manufacture and design products to our customers\u2019 specifications; in some cases, our processes and facilities must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. For example, medical devices that we manufacture or design, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or non-U.S. counterparts of this agency. Similarly, items we manufacture for customers in the A&D industries, as well as the processes we use to produce them, are regulated by the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Authority, which have increased their focus and penalties related to counterfeit materials. In addition, our customers\u2019 products and the manufacturing processes or documentation that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or noncompliant with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation could also be damaged. The failure of our\nproducts, manufacturing processes or facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements could subject us to fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a product, process or facility. In addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us or expose us to liability to pay for the recall of a product. The magnitude of any such claim may increase as we expand our medical and aerospace and defense manufacturing services, as defects in medical, aerospace or defense devices or systems could seriously harm or kill users of these products and others. Even if our customers are responsible for the defects, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects, which could expose us to additional liability claims.\nTechnology Risks\nIf we are unable to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our manufacturing and engineering services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development. We are continually evaluating the advantages and feasibility of new manufacturing processes. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and provide manufacturing services that meet our customers\u2019 changing needs. This requires that we maintain technological leadership and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis. Our failure to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to cyberattacks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business. We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage, processing and transmissions, as well as in our interactions with customers and suppliers. Examples of these digital technologies include ERP, shop floor control, test equipment, and other similar business applications, our global infrastructure and networks as well as external systems, analytics, automation, and cloud services. Digital technologies and services are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite our efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. In particular, as discussed further below, our operations have been, and may in the future be, subject to ransomware or cyber-extortion attacks, which could significantly disrupt our operations. Generally, such attacks involve restricting access to computer systems or vital data.\nWe routinely monitor our systems for cyber threats and have processes in place to detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we have experienced cyberattacks and attempted breaches, including phishing emails and other targeted attacks. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, a ransomware incident encrypted information on our systems and disrupted customer and employee access to our systems and services, which resulted in the Company incurring costs relating to this event, including to retain third party consultants and forensic experts to assist with the restoration and remediation of systems and, with the assistance of law enforcement, to investigate the attack, as well as increased expenditures for our information technology (IT) infrastructure, systems and network. This ransomware incident also adversely affected our operations and the Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 revenue. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nFuture cybersecurity incidents could result in the misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, employees, business partners or others; litigation and potential liability; enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities; loss of customers and contracts; damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and/or otherwise harm its business. We also expect to incur substantial costs in the future to satisfy customer requirements (including costs arising from the U.S. government\u2019s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program) and to mitigate against cybersecurity attacks as threats are expected to continue to become more persistent and sophisticated. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things: loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; interruption of our business operations; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other third parties, and may result in claims against us. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nAny delay in the upgrade of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs.\nWe are currently upgrading our IT infrastructure and enterprise resource planning system, which we anticipate taking several years. Failure to complete the upgrade timely or at all could leave us with sites without the systems\ncapability to flexibly support future customer requirements for manufacturing capabilities and data driven analytics, as well as result in unanticipated increases in costs.\nFinancial Risks\nOur level of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in operating our business and reacting to changes in our business or industry, or prevent us from making payments on our debt or obtaining additional financing.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total outstanding debt (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and finance leases) was $136.9 million, all of which represented borrowings under our term loan facility (the Term Loan). Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates since the Term Loan has a variable rate;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations.\nAny of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk; our goodwill may become impaired.\nWe have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. We are required to assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. A significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization could result in material charges in future periods that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position. As of December 31, 2020, we had $192.1 million in goodwill and $70.0 million of identifiable intangible assets. See Note 1(i) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nWe may be exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk on our outstanding borrowings under our variable rate credit agreement. These borrowings\u2019 interest rates are based on the spread, at our option, over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), the bank\u2019s prime rate or the federal funds rate. We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our invested cash balances.\nThe elimination of LIBOR could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Borrowings under our credit facilities use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Specifically, the use of an alternative reference rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense on our borrowings, and increased borrowing costs in the future. Management continues to evaluate the LIBOR exposure risks.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Shares\nWe may experience fluctuations in quarterly results.\nOur quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe volume of customer orders relative to our capacity;\n\u2022\ncustomer introduction and market acceptance of new products;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for customer products;\n\u2022\nseasonality in demand for customer products;\n\u2022\npricing and other competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders;\n\u2022\nour effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nchanges in cost and availability of labor and components;\n\u2022\nchanges in our product mix;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, trade agreements and other trade protection measures;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndisruptions caused by computer malfunctions or cybersecurity incidents; and\n\u2022\nlocal factors and events that may affect our production volume, such as local holidays, pandemics or natural disasters.\nAdditionally, as is the case with many high technology companies, a significant portion of our shipments typically occur in the last few weeks of a given quarter. Accordingly, sales shifts from quarter to quarter may not be readily apparent until the end of a given quarter and may have a significant effect on projected and reported results. Further, the price of our common shares may experience volatility in response to fluctuating quarterly results.\nProvisions in our governing documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of the Company.\nCertain provisions of our governing documents and the Texas Business Organizations Code may delay, inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of the Company through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or some other method, even if shareholders might consider such a development beneficial. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na provision in our certificate of formation granting the Board of Directors authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the relative rights and preferences of such preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovisions in our bylaws restricting shareholders from acting by less than unanimous written consent and requiring advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022\na provision in our bylaws restricting anyone, other than the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Board of Directors or the holders of at least 10% of all outstanding shares entitled to vote, from calling a special meeting of the shareholders;\n\u2022\na statutory restriction on the ability of shareholders to take action by less than unanimous written consent; and\n\u2022\na statutory restriction on business combinations with some types of interested shareholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are exposed to general economic and market conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainty over the erosion of global consumer confidence, geopolitical events, global pandemics, such as COVID-19, the availability and cost of credit, concerns about volatile energy costs, declining asset values, inflation, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations can slow global economic growth and result in recessionary conditions. Any of these potential negative economic conditions may reduce demand for our customers\u2019 products and adversely affect our sales. Consequently, our past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings and cash flows.\nIn addition to our customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, a number of other negative effects on our business could materialize, including the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result in production delays, shorter payment terms from suppliers due to reduced availability of credit default insurance in the market, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, increase our need for cash, and decrease our net revenue and profitability.\nIn cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us, we establish reserves in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk. There can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional receivable and inventory reserves may be required and restructuring charges may be incurred.\nAcquisitions may pose difficulties for us.\nOur capabilities have historically grown through acquisitions, and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our projections of results and successful integration of acquired operations into our network involve risks, including:\n\u2022\nintegration and management of the operations;\n\u2022\nas noted above, demand can vary, and our projections of results may be wrong due to deferred or reduced demand;\n\u2022\nretention of key personnel;\n\u2022\nintegration of purchasing operations and information systems;\n\u2022\nretention of the customer base of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nmanagement of an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that past transactions or practices may lead to future commercial or regulatory risks;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other ongoing business concerns, and\n\u2022\ninadequate internal control over financial reporting and our ability to bring such controls into compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner.\nOur profitability will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate an acquisition, if the acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expected or if we do not achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses associated with these acquisitions. We may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on, our investments, which could adversely affect our operating results and potentially cause impairments to assets that we record as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our key personnel.\nWe depend significantly on our executive officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any one of these executive officers or other key personnel, or the failure to attract and retain new personnel, could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur business or stock price could be negatively affected by the actions of activist shareholders or others.\nResponding to actions by activist shareholders or others can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Our ability to execute our strategic plan could also be impaired. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors would require us to incur significant fees and expenses, as well as requiring significant time and attention by management and our Board of Directors. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our common shares, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers or others.", "PERMNO": 76224, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "BHE"}
