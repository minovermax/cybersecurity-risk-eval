{"cik": "1124524", "company": "Cryoport, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. Because our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Cryoport, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our actual future results, including, but not limited to, our potential product and service revenues, acceptance of our products and services, expenses, net income(loss) and earnings(loss) per common share.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant losses to date and may continue to incur losses.\nWe have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since we commenced operations. The following table represents net losses incurred for each of our last two fiscal years:\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $113.1 million. In order to achieve and sustain revenue growth in the future, we must significantly expand our market presence and revenues from existing and new customers. We may continue to incur losses in the future and may never generate revenues sufficient to become profitable or to sustain profitability. Continuing losses may impair our ability to raise the additional capital required to continue and expand our operations.\nOur auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our cash and cash equivalent balance at March 31, 2016 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funding, we may have to reduce or discontinue our business operations.\nAs of June 13, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 million. Therefore, our ability to continue and expand our operations is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to fund future operations.\nIn April 2016, we completed a tender offer. Pursuant to the offer, original warrants were amended and exercised in connection therewith, resulting in the issuance by the Company of an aggregate of 2,020,597 shares of its common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $2.5 million. In June 2016, we completed a rights offering for gross proceeds of $1.3 million in subscriptions for 841,873 shares of common stock.\nWe anticipate, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to our ability to market and sell our products, that our cash on hand and the proceeds from a recently completed tender offering and rights offering, together with projected cash flows, will satisfy our operational and capital requirements through the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. There are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections that could reduce or delay our future projected revenues and cash-inflows, including, but not limited to, our ability to increase our customer base and revenues. If our projected revenues and cash- inflows are reduced or delayed, we may not have sufficient capital to operate through the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 unless we raise more capital. Additionally, if we are unable to realize satisfactory revenue in the near future, we will be required to seek additional financing to continue our operations beyond that period. We will also require additional financing to expand into other markets and further develop and market our products. We have no current arrangements with respect to any additional financing. Consequently, there can be no assurance that any additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, will be available when needed. The inability to obtain additional capital may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders. The uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur agreements with global providers of shipping services may not result in a significant increase in our revenues or cash flow, soon or in the future.\nWe believe that establishing strategic alliances with global providers (integrators) of logistics and of shipping services, such as our agreements with FedEx, DHL, and UPS can drive growth in our revenues, but there is no certainty to this view. We are seeking to establish similar arrangements with other providers of international shipping services. We anticipate all such alliances will enable us to provide seamless, end-to-end shipping solutions to customers of our respective alliance partners and allow us to leverage the established relationships with those customers, but there is no guarantee this will happen.\nIn January 2013, we entered into an agreement with FedEx, renewing FedEx\u2019s right to, on a non-exclusive basis, promote, market and sell transportation of our shippers and our related value-added goods and services and providing FedEx with a non-exclusive license and right to use a customized version of our Cryoportal\u2122 software platform for the management of shipments made by FedEx customers. In June 2014, we added DHL as our second major distribution partner, whereby DHL can offer our validated and comprehensive cryogenic solutions to its life sciences and healthcare customers on a global basis. In October 2014, we entered into an agreement with UPS related to our participation in UPS\u2019s efforts to expand its provision of cryogenic shipping services to the life sciences industry.\nBecause our agreements with FedEx, DHL, and UPS do not contain any requirement that they use a minimum level of our services, there can be no assurance of any significant increase in our revenues or cash flows as a result of these strategic alliances.\nOur agreements with providers of vaccines may not result in a significant increase in our revenues or cash flow.\nWe believe that establishing strategic relationships with manufacturers and distributors of treatments for animals and humans, such as our agreements with Zoetis, Inc. can drive growth in our revenues.\nIn December 2012, we entered an agreement with what became Zoetis, Inc. (in January 2013, Pfizer spun off its animal health business into Zoetis, Inc., a public company) pursuant to which we were engaged to manage frozen shipments of a key poultry vaccine from Zoetis\u2019 production site in the United States. Over time, Zoetis has further expanded our role in providing them assistance in managing their cryogenic distribution of their vaccines and has become our largest customer.\nWhile we anticipate growth in shipments by Zoetis under our management, there can be no assurance of any significant increase in our revenues or cash flows as a result of these important alliances.\nWe will have difficulty increasing our revenues if we experience delays, difficulties or unanticipated costs in establishing the sales, distribution and marketing capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our solutions.\nWe plan to improve our sales, distribution, and marketing capabilities in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. It will be expensive and time-consuming for us to develop our global marketing and sales network and thus we intend to rely on our strategic alliances with FedEx, DHL, and UPS. We further intend to seek to enter into additional strategic alliances with international providers of shipping services to incorporate use of our solutions in their service offerings. We may not be able to provide adequate incentive to our sales force or to establish and maintain favorable distribution and marketing collaborations with others to promote our solutions. In addition, any third party with whom we have established a marketing and distribution relationship may not devote sufficient time to the marketing and sales of our solutions, thereby exposing us to potential expenses in exiting such distribution agreements. We, and any of our alliance partners, must also market our services in compliance with federal, state, local and international laws relating to the provision of incentives and inducements. Violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties. Therefore, if we are unable to successfully motivate and expand our marketing and sales force and further develop our sales and marketing capabilities, or if our alliance partners fail to promote our solutions, we will have difficulty increasing our revenues and the revenue may not off-set the additional expense of expansion.\nOur ability to grow and compete in our industry will be hampered if we are unable to retain the continued service of our key professionals or to identify, hire and retain additional qualified professionals.\nA critical factor to our business is our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals including key employees and consultants. We are continually at risk of losing current professionals or being unable to hire additional professionals as needed. If we are unable to attract new qualified employees, our ability to grow will be adversely affected. If we are unable to retain current employees or strategic consultants, our financial condition and ability to maintain operations may be adversely affected.\nSustainable future revenue growth is dependent on new solutions and services.\nOur future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new solutions and services to market on a timely basis. We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new solutions and services, enhance existing solutions and services, and achieve market acceptance of such solutions and services. We may incur problems in introducing new solutions and services.\nThe adoption cycle of our target customers tends to be very lengthy, which continues to adversely affect our ability to increase revenues quickly.\nWe offer our solutions primarily to companies in the life sciences industry. These companies operate within a heavily regulated environment and as such, changing vendors and distribution practices typically require a number of steps, which may include the audit of our facilities, review of our procedures, qualifying us as a vendor, and performing test shipments. This process can take several months or longer to complete, involving multiple levels of approval, prior to a company fully adopting our Cryoport Express\u00ae Solutions. The logistics management of many companies is decentralized adding to the time need to effect adaptation of our solutions. In addition, any such adoption may be on a gradual basis such that the customer progressively ramps up use of our Cryoport Express\u00ae Solutions following adoption. The slow adoption process continues to adversely affect our ability to increase revenues.\nThe loss of key members of our executive management team could adversely affect our business.\nOur success in implementing our business strategy depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. The collective efforts of each of these persons working as a team will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies, tests and research and development and sales programs. As a result of the difficulty in locating qualified new management, the loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could adversely affect our operations. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we could experience difficulties in finding qualified successors, competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategy. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees.\nOur solutions and services may contain errors or defects, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenues, diverted development resources and increased service costs and litigation.\nOur solutions and services must meet stringent requirements and we must develop our services and solutions quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market. Solutions as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new equipment or versions of our software are released. If our solutions are not free from errors or defects, we may incur an injury to our reputation, lost revenues, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, and litigation. The costs incurred in correcting any product errors or defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we were sued for product liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims were someone to allege that our products failed to perform as designed. A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nAlthough we believe that our existing insurance is adequate, our insurers may fail to defend us or our insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability claims. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation, or cause current clinical partners and collaborators to terminate existing agreements and potential clinical partners to seek other partners, cause customers to terminate their relationship with us and potential customers to seek alternative solutions, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nIf we experience manufacturing delays, interruptions in production, or delays in procurement of shippers manufactured by third parties, then we may experience customer dissatisfaction and our reputation could suffer.\nIf we fail to produce enough shippers at our own manufacturing facility or at a third party manufacturing facility, or if we fail to complete our shipper recycling processes as planned, we may be unable to deliver shippers to our customers on a timely basis, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and could harm our reputation and ability to compete. We currently acquire various component parts for our shippers from various independent manufacturers in the United States. We would likely experience significant delays or cessation in producing our shippers if a labor strike, natural disaster or other supply disruption were to occur at any of our main suppliers. If we are unable to procure a component from one of our manufacturers, we may be required to enter into arrangements with one or more alternative manufacturing companies, which may cause delays in producing our shippers. In addition, because we depend (in part) on third party manufacturers, our profit margins may be lower, which will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability. To date, we have not experienced any material delay that has adversely impacted our operations. As our business develops it becomes more likely that such problems could arise.\nWe expect to base our equipment and inventory purchasing decisions on our forecasts of customers\u2019 demand, and if our forecasts are inaccurate, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nAs our customer base increases, we expect to need to purchase additional equipment and inventory. Our forecasts will be based on multiple assumptions, each of which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate, affecting our ability to provide products to our customers. When demand for our products increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs in order to rush the manufacture and delivery of additional products. If we underestimate customers\u2019 demand, we may forego revenue opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase more equipment and inventory than we are able to use or sell at any given time or at all. As a result of our failure properly to estimate demand for our products, we could have excess or obsolete equipment and/or inventory, resulting in a decline in the value of our equipment and/or inventory, which would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our liquidity. Our failure to accurately manage our equipment purchases and inventory relative to demand would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we experience delays or interruption in shipping due to factors outside of our control, such disruption could lead to customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation.\nWe rely on third party shipment and carrier services to transport our shippers containing biological material. These third party operations could be subject to natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, other business disruptions, and carrier error, which could cause delays in the delivery of our shippers, which in turn could cause serious harm to the biological material being shipped. As a result, any prolonged delay in shipment, whether due to technical difficulties, power failures, break-ins, destruction or damage to carrier facilities as a result of a natural disaster, fire, or any other reason, could result in damage to the contents of the shipper. If we are unable to cause the delivery of our shippers in a timely matter and without damage, this could also harm our operating results and our reputation, even if we are not at fault.\nOur solutions and services may expose us to liability in excess of our current insurance coverage.\nOur solutions and services involve significant risks of liability, which may substantially exceed the revenues we derive from them. We cannot predict the magnitude of these potential liabilities. We currently maintain general liability insurance, with coverage in the amount of $1 million per occurrence, subject to a $2 million annual limitation, and product liability insurance with a $1 million annual coverage limitation. Claims may be made against us that exceed these limits.\nOur liability policy is an \u201coccurrence\u201d based policy. Thus, our policy is complete when we purchased it and following cancellation of the policy it continues to provide coverage for future claims based on conduct that took place during the policy term. Our insurance coverage, however, may not protect us against all liability because our policies typically have various exceptions to the claims covered and also require us to assume some costs of the claim even though a portion of the claim may be covered. In addition, if we expand into new markets, we may not be aware of the need for, or be able to obtain insurance coverage for such activities or, if insurance is obtained, the dollar amount of any liabilities incurred could exceed our insurance coverage. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur customers may ship potentially harmful biological materials in our dewars. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages.\nIf we cannot compete effectively, we will lose business.\nOur services and solutions are positioned to be competitive in the life sciences cold-chain logistics market. While there are technological and marketing barriers to entry, we cannot guarantee that the barriers we are capable of producing will be sufficient to defend the market share we wish to gain against current and future competitors. Our principal competitive considerations in our market include:\n\u00b7 financial resources to allocate to proper marketing and an appropriate sales effort\n\u00b7 acceptance of our solutions model\n\u00b7 acceptance of our solutions including per use fee structures and other charges for services\n\u00b7 keeping up technologically with ongoing development of enhanced features and benefits\n\u00b7 reductions in the delivery costs of competitors\u2019 solutions\n\u00b7 the ability to develop and maintain and expand strategic alliances\n\u00b7 establishing our brand name\n\u00b7 our ability to deliver our solutions to our customers when requested\n\u00b7 our timing of introductions of new solutions, and services\n\u00b7 financial resources to support working capital needs and required capital investments in infrastructure\nCurrent and prospective competitors have substantially greater resources, more customers, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry. As a result, these competitors may be able to develop and expand their networks and product offerings more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their solutions and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. In addition, these competitors have entered and will likely continue to enter into business relationships to provide additional solutions competitive to those we provide or plan to provide.\nWe may acquire other businesses, products or technologies in order to remain competitive in our market and our business could be adversely affected as a result of any of these future acquisitions.\nWe may make acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. If we identify any appropriate acquisition candidates, we may not be successful in negotiating acceptable terms of the acquisition, financing the acquisition, or integrating the acquired business, products or technologies into our existing business and operations. Further, completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business will significantly divert management time and resources. The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business. If we consummate any significant acquisitions using stock or other securities as consideration, our shareholders' equity could be significantly diluted. If we make any significant acquisitions using cash consideration, we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash. Acquisition financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we may be required to amortize significant amounts of other intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions, which would harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we successfully develop products and/or services, but those products and/or services do not achieve and maintain market acceptance, our business will not be profitable.\nThe degree of acceptance of our Cryoport Express\u00ae Solutions or any future products or services by our current target markets, and any other markets to which we attempt to sell our products and services, and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors including, among others:\n\u2022 our shippers\u2019 ability to perform and preserve the integrity of the materials shipped\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of use of our shipper and/or CryoportalTM\n\u2022 availability of alternative products\n\u2022 pricing and cost effectiveness\n\u2022 effectiveness of our or our collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategy\n\u2022 the adoption cycles of our targeted customers\nIf any products or services we may develop do not achieve market acceptance, then we may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIn addition, even if our products and services achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or services are introduced that are more favorably received than our products and services, are more cost effective, or render our products obsolete. Although we are not aware of any other treatments or methods currently being developed that would directly compete with the methods we employ, there can be no assurance that future developments in technology will not make our technology non-competitive or obsolete, or significantly reduce our operating margins or the demand for our offerings, or otherwise negatively impact our ability to be profitable.\nWe may not be able to compete with our competitors in the industry because many of them have greater resources than we do.\nWe expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. In addition, there may be other companies which are currently developing competitive products and services or which may in the future develop technologies and products that are comparable, superior or less costly than our own. For example, some cryogenic equipment manufacturers with greater resources currently have solutions for storing and transporting cryogenic liquid and gasses and may develop storage solutions that compete with our products. Additionally, some specialty couriers with greater resources currently provide dry ice transportation and may develop other products in the future, both of which compete with our products. A competitor that has greater resources than us may be able to bring its product to market faster than we can and offer its product at a lower price than us to establish market share. We may not be able to successfully compete with a competitor that has greater resources and such competition may adversely affect our business.\nIntellectual Property Risks Associated with Our Business\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our solutions and business model, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nOur policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States patent applications related to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We have three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and one recently filed U.S. provisional patent application, all relating to various aspects of our solutions and services. Our patents or patent application may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future or the rights granted may not provide a competitive advantage. We intend to vigorously protect and defend our intellectual property. Costly and time-consuming litigation brought by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. In the past our employees, consultants, advisors and suppliers have not always executed confidentiality agreements and inventions assignment and work for hire agreements in connection with their employment, consulting, or advisory relationships. Consequently, we may not have adequate remedies available to us to protect our intellectual property should one of these parties attempt to use our trade secrets or refuse to assign any rights he or she may have in any intellectual property he or she developed for us. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology, or we may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights in unpatented proprietary technology.\nWhile we are not aware of any third party that is infringing any of our patents or trademarks nor do we believe that we are infringing on the patents or trademarks of any other person or organization, we cannot guarantee that our current and potential competitors and other third parties have not filed (or in the future will not file) patent applications for (or have not received or in the future will not receive) patents or obtain additional proprietary rights that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our solutions either in the United States or internationally. Additionally, we may face assertions of claims by holders of patents alleging that we are infringing upon their patent rights, which claims may be without merit, but may nonetheless result in our incurring substantial costs of defense.\nWe are dependent on a third party for the continued development and maintenance of our Cryoportal\u2122 software.\nOur proprietary Cryoportal\u2122 is a logistics platform software used by our customers, business partners and client care team to automate the entry of orders, prepare customs documentation and facilitate status and location monitoring of shipped orders while in transit. The continued development of the Cryoportal\u2122 platform is contracted with an outside software development company. If this developer becomes unable or unwilling to continue work on scheduled projects, and an alternative software development company cannot be secured, we may not be able to implement needed enhancements to the system. Furthermore, if we terminate our agreement with our current software developer and cannot reach an agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement for the termination, it is possible we could lose our license to use this software. Failure to proceed with enhancements or the loss of our license for the system would adversely affect our ability to generate new business and serve existing customers, resulting in a reduction in revenue.\nOur customers could also become the target of litigation relating to the patent and other intellectual property rights of others.\nAny litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of others could trigger technical support and indemnification obligations in licenses or customer agreements that we may enter into. These obligations could result in substantial expenses, including the payment by us of costs and damages relating to claims of intellectual property infringement. In addition to the time and expense required for us to provide support or indemnification to our customers, any such litigation could disrupt the businesses of our customers, which in turn could hurt our relationships with such customers and cause the sale of our products to decrease. No assurance can be given that claims for indemnification will not be made, or that if made, such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial conditions.\nOur Cryoportal\u2122 software platform may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future revenues.\nWe have implemented our Cryoportal\u2122 software platform which is used by our customers and business partners to automate the entry of orders, prepare customs documentation and facilitate status and location monitoring of shipped orders while in transit. Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions, we could be a target of cyber-attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of the Cryoportal\u2122 software platform. Similarly, experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our Cryoportal\u2122 software platform in an effort to search for and misappropriate proprietary or confidential information or cause interruptions of our services. Because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. Our activities could be adversely affected and our reputation, brand and future sales could be harmed if such intentionally disruptive efforts were successful.\nRegulatory Risks Relating to Our Business\nComplying with certain regulations that apply to shipments using our solutions can limit our activities and increase our cost of operations.\nShipments using our solutions and services are subject to various regulations in the various countries in which we operate. For example, shipments using our solutions may be required to comply with the shipping requirements promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d), the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) as well as rules established by the IATA and the ICAO. Additionally, our data logger may be subject to regulation and certification by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), and the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d). We will need to ensure that our solutions and services comply with relevant rules and regulations to make our solutions and services marketable, and in some cases compliance is difficult to determine. Significant changes in such regulations could require costly changes to our solutions and services or prevent use of our shippers for an extended period of time while we seek to comply with changed regulations. If we are unable to comply with any of these rules or regulations or fail to obtain any required approvals, our ability to market our solutions and services may be adversely affected. In addition, even if we are able to comply with these rules and regulations, compliance can result in increased costs. In either event, our financial results and condition may be adversely affected. We depend on our business partners and unrelated and frequently unknown third party agents in foreign countries to act on our behalf to complete the importation process and to make delivery of our shippers to the final user. The failure of these third parties to perform their duties could result in damage to the contents of the shipper resulting in customer dissatisfaction or liability to us, even if we are not at fault.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Other Securities\nCertain of our existing stockholders own and have the right to acquire a substantial number of shares of common stock.\nAs of June 13, 2016, our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned 1,968,625 shares of common stock (without regard to beneficial ownership limitations contained in certain warrants) assuming their exercise of all outstanding warrants and options that are exercisable within 60 days of June 13, 2016 or approximately 12.7% of our outstanding common stock. As such, the concentration of beneficial ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Cryoport and may adversely affect the voting or other rights of other holders of our common stock.\nThe sale of substantial shares of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nAs of June 13, 2016, there were 14,271,910 shares of our common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares of common stock are eligible for trading in the public market. The market price of our common stock may decline if our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur. We could also issue up to 16,162,508 shares of our common stock including 9,133,064 shares to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 7,029,444 shares upon exercise of outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans as of June 13, 2016.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 technological innovations or new solutions and services by us or our competitors\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel\n\u2022 sales of our common stock\n\u2022 our ability to execute our business plan\n\u2022 our operating results being below expectations\n\u2022 loss of any strategic relationship\n\u2022 industry developments\n\u2022 economic and other external factors\n\u2022 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and warrants.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because our stock price and those of other biotechnology and life sciences companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business. We do maintain insurance, but the coverage may not be sufficient and may not be available in all instances.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock and warrants, the price of our common stock and warrants could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock and warrants relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock and warrants could decline if one or more equity analyst downgrades our stock or if analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the Board of Directors may consider the payment of any such dividends. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe need additional capital, and the sale of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOur current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to meet our cash needs. We require additional cash resources to fund our operations and may require additional funds in the future due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. The sale of additional equity securities, or debt securities convertible into equity securities, could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nWhile warrants to purchase our common stock are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital.\nAs of June 13, 2016, we have outstanding options and warrants for the purchase of up to 16,162,508 shares of our common stock, including 9,133,064 shares to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 7,029,444 shares upon exercise of outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans as of June 13, 2016. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while some or all of these warrants are outstanding. At any time during which these warrants are likely to be exercised, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and we could be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 2,500,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to 2,500,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, without action by our stockholders. We have designated 800,000 shares as Class A Preferred Stock and 585,000 shares as Class B Preferred Stock, none of which are currently issued and outstanding. Accordingly, our board of directors will have discretion to issue up to 1,115,000 shares on terms determined by them. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock and Preferred Stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and Preferred Stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock. In addition, the issuance of such shares of blank check preferred stock could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company.\nProvisions in our bylaws and Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our management and, as a result, may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our bylaws and Nevada law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. The relevant bylaw provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, and the ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nAbsent approval of our Board of Directors, our bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, Section 78.438 of the Nevada Revised Statutes prohibits a publicly-held Nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 10% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and other potential anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nEven though we are not incorporated in California, we may become subject to a number of provisions of the California General Corporation Law.\nSection 2115(b) of the California Corporations Code imposes certain requirements of California corporate law on corporations organized outside California that, in general, are doing more than 50% of their business in California and have more than 50% of their outstanding voting securities held of record by persons residing in California. While we are not currently subject to Section 2115(b), we may become subject to it in the future.\nThe following summarizes some of the principal differences which would apply if we become subject to Section 2115(b).\nUnder both Nevada and California law, cumulative voting for the election of directors is permitted. However, under Nevada law cumulative voting must be expressly authorized in the Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), we may be required to permit cumulative voting if any stockholder properly requests to cumulate his or her votes.\nUnder Nevada law, directors may be removed by the stockholders only by the vote of two-thirds of the voting power of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote. However, California law permits the removal of directors by the vote of only a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), the removal of a director may be accomplished by a majority vote, rather than a vote of two-thirds, of the stockholders entitled to vote.\nUnder California law, the corporation must take certain steps to be allowed to provide for greater indemnification of its officers and directors than is provided in the California Corporation Code. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), our ability to indemnify our officers and directors, to the extent permitted in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and under Nevada law, may be limited by California law.\nNevada law permits distributions to stockholders as long as, after the distribution, (i) the corporation would be able to pay its debts as they become due and (ii) the corporation\u2019s total assets are at least equal to its liabilities and preferential dissolution obligations. Under California law, distributions may be made to stockholders as long as the corporation would be able to pay its debts as they mature and either (i) the corporation\u2019s retained earnings equal or exceed the amount of the proposed distributions, or (ii) after the distributions, the corporation\u2019s tangible assets are at least 125% of its liabilities and the corporation\u2019s current assets are at least equal to its current liabilities (or, 125% of its current liabilities if the corporation\u2019s average operating income for the two most recently completed fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for those fiscal years). If we become subject to Section 2115(b), we will have to satisfy more stringent financial requirements to be able to pay dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, stockholders may be liable to the corporation if we pay dividends in violation of California law.\nCalifornia law permits a corporation to provide \u201csupermajority vote\u201d provisions in its Articles of Incorporation, which would require specific actions to obtain greater than a majority of the votes, but not more than 66 2/3 percent. Nevada law does not permit supermajority vote provisions. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), it is possible that our stockholders would vote to amend our Articles of Incorporation and require a supermajority vote for us to take specific actions.\nUnder California law, in a disposition of substantially of all the corporation\u2019s assets, if the acquiring party is in control of or under common control with the disposing corporation, the principal terms of the sale must be approved by 90 percent of the stockholders. Although Nevada law does contain certain rules governing interested stockholder business combinations, it does not require similar stockholder approval. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), we may have to obtain the vote of a greater percentage of the stockholders to approve a sale of our assets to a party that is in control of, or under common control with, us.\nCalifornia law places certain additional approval rights in connection with a merger if all of the shares of each class or series of a corporation are not treated equally or if the surviving or parent party to a merger represents more than 50 percent of the voting power of the other corporation prior to the merger. Nevada law does not require such approval. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), we may have to obtain the vote of a greater percentage of the stockholders to approve a merger that treats shares of a class or series differently or where a surviving or parent party to the merger represents more than 50% of the voting power of the other corporation prior to the merger.\nCalifornia law requires the vote of each class to approve a reorganization or a conversion of a corporation into another entity. Nevada law does not require a separate vote for each class. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), we may have to obtain the approval of each class if we desire to reorganize or convert into another type of entity.\nCalifornia law provides greater dissenters\u2019 rights to stockholders than Nevada law. If we become subject to Section 2115(b), more stockholders may be entitled to dissenters\u2019 rights, which may limit our ability to merge with another entity or reorganize.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls.\nAs described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, no material weaknesses were identified and we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2016.\nAny failure to maintain such internal controls in the future could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and NASDAQ, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nOur publicly-filed SEC reports are reviewed by the SEC from time to time and any significant changes required as a result of any such review may result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe reports of publicly-traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements and to enhance the overall effectiveness of companies\u2019 public filings, and reviews of such reports are now required at least every three years under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. SEC reviews may be initiated at any time, and we could be required to modify or reformulate information contained in prior filings as a result of an SEC review. Any modification or reformulation of information contained in such reports could be significant and could result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a U.S. public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a U.S. public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, certain listing requirements, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. As a result of disclosure of information in this prospectus and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.", "PERMNO": 15506, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "CYRX"}
