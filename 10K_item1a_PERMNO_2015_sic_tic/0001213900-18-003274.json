You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. Our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of the following risks. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the value and trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Business\nWe may never successfully develop any products or generate revenues.\nWe are a pre-revenue stage company with research, development, marketing and general and administrative expenses. We may be unable to successfully develop or market any of our current or proposed products or technologies, those products or technologies may not generate any revenues, and any revenues generated may not be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability. We have only generated very minimal revenues to date.\nWe have historically incurred significant losses and there can be no assurance when, or if, we will achieve or maintain profitability.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company realized a net loss of $5,404,000 compared with a net loss of $4,334,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of the Company\u2019s products and business, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Expected future operating losses will have an adverse effect on our cash resources, shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Our failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of our stock and impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, diversify our portfolio of staffing companies, or continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Company.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017 the Company received additional cash proceeds in an amount of approximately $8,900,000 from the exercise of outstanding securities and from the sale of equity securities. Based on the projected cash flows and the cash balances as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management\u2019s plans consider that the cash generated from the recent exercise of outstanding securities and sale of equity securities will be sufficient to meet its obligations for a period which is longer than 12 months from the date of this report.\nManagement\u2019s plans include the continued commercialization of our products, growth and securing sufficient financing through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for our future growth of operations. If we are unsuccessful in commercializing our products and securing sufficient financing, we may need to cease operations.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn order to meet our business objectives in the future, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Additional capital would be used to accomplish the following:\n\u25cf finance our current operating expenses;\n\u25cf pursue growth opportunities;\n\u25cf hire and retain qualified management and key employees;\n\u25cf respond to competitive pressures;\n\u25cf comply with regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf maintain compliance with applicable laws.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then-outstanding. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining personnel, option or warrant exercises, future acquisitions or future placements of our securities for capital-raising or other business purposes. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nFurthermore, any additional debt or equity financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business is highly dependent on being able to predict which applications and technologies will be successful, and on the market acceptance and timely release of those applications and technologies. If we do not accurately predict which applications and technologies will be successful, our financial performance will be materially adversely affected.\nWe expect to derive most of our revenue by charging fees in connection with the usage of our applications and technologies. We must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of new applications and technologies. The release of our applications and technologies may be delayed, may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If the applications are not released when anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue growth may never materialize, we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed, and our financial performance will be harmed.\nWe are substantially dependent on assets we purchased from an affiliated party, and if we lose the rights to such assets or the assets are repurchased for any reason, our ability to develop existing and new applications based upon these assets would be harmed, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn February 2014, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Shoshana Zigdon pursuant to which we acquired certain rights in a venture for the accumulation of physical data of human beings by portable electronic devices (including smart phones, tablets and other portable devices) for the purpose of locating, based on the accumulated data, articles of clothing in internet apparel stores, which will fit the person whose measurements were so accumulated. In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we acquired the right, title and interest to the method and the certain patent application that had been filed by Shoshana Zigdon (PCT/IL2013/050056). Our business is substantially dependent upon the assets we acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Therefore, our ability to develop and commercialize our applications depends upon the effectiveness and continuation of the Purchase Agreement. If we lose the right to the Method or Patent application described above, our ability to develop existing and new applications would be harmed.\nIn consideration for the sale of the Method and Patent application, we agreed to pay to Shoshana Zigdon, 18% of the Company\u2019s operating profit, directly or indirectly connected with the Venture and/or the Method and/or the commercialization of the Patent together with value-added tax in accordance with the law for a period of seven years from the end of the development period of the Venture. Shoshana Zigdon\u2019s right to receive such consideration will apply even in the event the Patent is revoked/rejected/expires and/or the non-receipt of the Patent for any reason.\nThe Purchase Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a breach of the obligations of the other party and the failure to cure the default within a specified period of time. Further, Shoshana Zigdon has the right to repurchase the Method and Patent application from us upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events: (a) if an application for liquidation of the Company and/or an application for appointment of a receiver for the Company and/or for a significant part of its assets has been filed, and/or an attachment has been imposed on a significant part of the Company\u2019s assets, and the application or attachment - as the case may be - has not been not canceled within 60 days from the date on which they are filed; or (b) if upon the date that is seven years from the date of execution of the Purchase Agreement, the amount of Company\u2019s income, directly and/or indirectly accumulated from the Venture and/or the method and/or the commercialization of the Patent is less than New Israeli Shekel (\u201cNIS\u201d) 3.6 million (approximately $1 million). If Shoshana Zigdon repurchases the Method and Patent application, our ability to develop our proposed products would be significantly harmed. Furthermore, we may lose the ability to commercialize any products that we have already developed.\nChanges in economic conditions could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our target customers are retailers, we, together with the rest of the retail industry, will depend upon consumer discretionary spending once we develop our proposed products. Increases in unemployment rates, reductions in home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies and reductions in access to credit and reduced consumer confidence, may impact consumers\u2019 ability and willingness to spend discretionary dollars. In addition, volatile economic conditions may repress consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation or lack of acceptance of our brand in existing and new markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to build a strong reputation for the quality of our technology, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand to be successful. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brand could significantly reduce our brand value and damage our business. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in quality, or in any way believe we fail to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer and our business may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully develop new retailers in new markets may be adversely affected by a lack of awareness or acceptance of our brand in these new markets. To the extent that we are unable to foster name recognition and affinity for our brand in new markets, our growth may be significantly delayed or impaired.\nAs a result, adverse economic conditions in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. In recent years, certain of these markets have been more negatively impacted by the housing decline, high unemployment rates and the overall economic crisis than other geographic areas. In addition, given our geographic concentration, negative publicity regarding any of our retailers in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, adverse weather conditions, hurricanes, droughts or other natural or man-made disasters.\nIn particular, adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our retailers, and, in more severe cases, cause temporary retail closures, sometimes for prolonged periods. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with retail sales typically higher during certain months, such as December. Adverse weather conditions during our most favorable months or periods may exacerbate the effect of adverse weather on consumer traffic and may cause fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter within a fiscal year.\nTechnology changes rapidly in our business, and if we fail to anticipate new technologies, the quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer.\nRapid technology changes require us to anticipate which technologies and/or distribution platforms our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products, then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses.\nWe rely upon third parties to provide distribution for our applications, and disruption in these services could harm our business.\nWe currently utilize, and plan on continuing to utilize over the current fiscal year, third-party networking providers and distribution through companies including, but not limited to, Apple and Google to distribute our technologies. If disruptions or capacity constraints occur, the Company may have no means of replacing these services, on a timely basis or at all. This could cause a material adverse condition for our operations and financial earnings.\nWe rely on third-party hosting and cloud computing providers to operate certain aspects of our business. any failure, disruption or significant interruption in our network or hosting and cloud services could adversely impact our operations and harm our business.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our mobile applications and customer satisfaction. Our mobile applications run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate and maintain elements of this system, but significant elements of this system are operated by third-parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace. We expect this dependence on third-parties to continue. In particular, a significant portion, if not almost all data storage, data processing and other computing services and systems is hosted by cloud computing providers. Any disruptions, outages and other performance problems relating to such services, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be harmed by improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential Company, employee, associate or customer data, including personal data.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we plan to store, process and transmit data, including personal and payment information, about our employees, customers, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs.\nSuch disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to government sanctions and liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as we introduce new services and offerings, such as mobile technology. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe might not be able to successfully market our products.\nWe expend significant resources in our marketing efforts, using a variety of media, including social media venues such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. In addition, we use targeted marketing on certain websites and have engaged two sales people in Europe and three sales people in the U.S. to market our products. We expect to continue to conduct brand awareness programs and guest initiatives to attract potential users. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of substantial revenues. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to purchase significantly more advertising than we are able to purchase. Should our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotions or our advertising funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising and promotions be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations and future development could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\nThe success of our business continues to depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. Our future performance will be substantially dependent in particular on our ability to retain and motivate Ronen Luzon, our Chief Executive Officer, and certain of our other senior executive officers. We currently do not have an employment agreement in place with these officers. The loss of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, senior officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans for future development. We have no reason to believe that we will lose the services of any of these individuals in the foreseeable future; however, we currently have no effective replacement for any of these individuals due to their experience, reputation in the industry and special role in our operations. We also do not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of our employees.\nOur growth may strain our infrastructure and resources, which could slow our development of new retailers and adversely affect our ability to manage our existing retailers.\nOur future growth may strain our retail management systems and resources, financial controls and information systems. Those demands on our infrastructure and resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our existing retailers. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure or to manage other factors necessary for us to meet our expansion objectives, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if sales decline, we may be unable to reduce our infrastructure quickly enough to prevent sales deleveraging, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business operations are conducted in multiple languages and could be disrupted due to miscommunications or translation errors.\nThe success of our business continues to depend on our marketing efforts in the United States, Europe and Israel, each of which is conducted in the local language. Miscommunications or inaccurate foreign language translations could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial conditions. Additionally, contracts, communications and complex technical information must be accurately translated into foreign languages.\nWe do not maintain theft or casualty insurance and only maintain modest liability and property insurance coverage and therefore could incur losses as a result of an uninsured loss.\nWe do not maintain theft or casualty insurance and only maintain modest liability and property insurance coverage. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur uninsured liabilities and losses as a result of the conduct of our business. Any such uninsured loss or liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our names and logos. We plan to register a number of our trademarks; however, no assurance can be given that our trademark applications will be approved. We have been issued three patents, one of each in of Russia, Japan and the U.S., have one patent-pending submission and an additional patent application which is in process. No assurance can be given that our patent-pending submission or the additional patent application which is in process will be approved. If our patent-pending submission or the additional patent application which is in process are not approved, our ability to expand or develop our business may be negatively affected.\nThird parties may also oppose our trademark or patent applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks or patents. In the event that our trademarks or patents are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our goods and services or redesign our technology, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands and products.\nIf our efforts to register, maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We may also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, our operating profits could be adversely affected. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, require us to rebrand our services, if feasible, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nAny royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products or services, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe will rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful.\nA material breach in security relating to our information systems and regulation related to such breaches could adversely affect us.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. For example, a cybercriminal could use cybersecurity threats to gain access to sensitive information about another company or to alter or disrupt news or information to be distributed by PR Newswire. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data, substantially damaging our reputation. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches, and may incur significant additional costs to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Our failure to prevent security breaches, or well-publicized security breaches affecting the Internet in general, could significantly harm our reputation and business and financial results.\nWe will continue to incur costs and be subject to various obligations as a result of being a public company, listed in the united states and in Israel.\nWe will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of being a public company, listed in the United States and in Israel. Although we will incur costs each year associated with being a publicly-traded company, it is possible that our actual costs of being a publicly-traded company will vary from year to year and may be different than our estimates. In estimating these costs, we take into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting and compliance activities.\nFurthermore, the need to maintain the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a U.S. publicly traded company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company.\nWe may require additional capital to finance our operations in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and could be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nWe may require additional capital for future operations. We plan to finance anticipated ongoing expenses and capital requirements with funds generated from the following sources:\n\u25cf cash provided by operating activities;\n\u25cf available cash and cash investments; and\n\u25cf capital raised through debt and equity offerings.\nCurrent conditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to us when needed or may be available only on unfavorable terms. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, if we raise capital by issuing stock, the holdings of our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nIf we raise capital by issuing debt securities, such debt securities would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, we may raise capital by issuing equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Finally, upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both.\nOur business is dependent upon continued market acceptance by consumers.\nWe are substantially dependent on continued market acceptance of our products by customers, and such customers are dependent upon regulatory and legislative forces. We cannot predict the future growth rate and size of this market. If we do not gain market acceptance of our applications, our business may be materially affected.\nIf we are able to expand our operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth.\nSince inception, we have been planning for the expansion of our brand. Any such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we will need to train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAny future or current litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFrom time to time we may be subject to litigation, including, among others, potential stockholder derivative actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. Subject to certain exceptions, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) require us to indemnify and advance expenses to our officers and directors involved in legal proceedings. To date we have obtained directors and officers liability (\u201cD&O\u201d) insurance to cover some of the risk exposure for our directors and officers. Such insurance generally pays the expenses (including amounts paid to plaintiffs, fines, and expenses including attorneys\u2019 fees) of officers and directors who are the subject of a lawsuit as a result of their service to the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain this insurance at reasonable rates or at all, or in amounts adequate to cover such expenses should such a lawsuit occur. Without D&O insurance, the amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and directors should they be subject to legal action based on their service to the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Such lawsuits, and any related publicity, may result in substantial costs and, among other things, divert the attention of management and our employees. An unfavorable outcome in any claim or proceeding against us could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods. Further, any settlement announced by us may expose us to further claims against us by third parties seeking monetary or other damages which, even if unsuccessful, would divert management attention from the business and cause us to incur costs, possibly material, to defend such matters, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d on page 24 for more information regarding the Company\u2019s involvement in ongoing litigation matters.\nOur prior operating results may not be indicative of our future results.\nYou should not consider prior operating results to be indicative of our future operating results. The timing and amount of future revenues will depend almost entirely on our ability to engage new retailers while maintaining a relationship with our existing retailers. Our future operating results will depend upon many other factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the level of product and price competition;\n\u25cf our success in expanding our business network and managing our growth;\n\u25cf the ability to hire qualified employees; and\n\u25cf the timing of such hiring and our ability to control costs.\nFederal, state and local or Israeli tax rules may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the U.S., as well as local taxes in Israel in respect to our operations in Israel. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, complying with new tax rules, laws or regulations could impact our financial condition, and increases to federal or state statutory tax rates and other changes in tax laws, rules or regulations may increase our effective tax rate. Any increase in our effective tax rate could have a material impact on our financial results.\nConcentration of ownership of our stock may enable one stockholder or a small number of stockholders to significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs March 19, 2018, members of our management team beneficially own approximately 8.23% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, one stockholder owns approximately 12% of our outstanding common stock. As such, management and the stockholder own approximately, in the aggregate, 20.23% of our voting power. As a result, management and the stockholder may have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including:\n\u25cf election of our Board of Directors;\n\u25cf removal of any of our directors;\n\u25cf amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; and\n\u25cf adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us.\nIn addition, management\u2019s and the stockholder\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. Any additional investors will own a minority percentage of our common stock and will have minority voting rights.\nTax reform may affect the Company and its stockholders.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and restricts the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising after December 31, 2017, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. We do not expect tax reform to have a material impact to our net operating losses. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our securities is uncertain. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not discuss any such tax legislation or the manner in which it might affect purchasers of our securities. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our securities.\nRisks Related To Our Operations In Israel\nThe Company has facilities located in Israel, and therefore, political conditions in Israel may affect the Company\u2019s operations and results.\nThe Company has facilities located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel will directly or indirectly affect the Company\u2019s operations and results. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. An ongoing state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic problems for Israel. For a number of years there have been continuing hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians. This includes hostilities with the Islamic movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which have adversely affected the peace process and at times resulted in armed conflicts. Such hostilities have negatively influenced Israel\u2019s economy as well as impaired Israel\u2019s relationships with several other countries. Israel also faces threats from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, from ISIS and rebel forces in Syria, from the government of Iran and other potential threats from additional countries in the region. Moreover, some of Israel\u2019s neighboring countries have recently undergone or are undergoing significant political changes. These political, economic and military conditions in Israel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth.\nIsrael\u2019s economy may become unstable.\nFrom time to time, Israel\u2019s economy may experience inflation or deflation, low foreign exchange reserves, fluctuations in world commodity prices, military conflicts and civil unrest. For these and other reasons, the government of Israel has intervened in the economy employing fiscal and monetary policies, import duties, foreign currency restrictions, controls of wages, prices and foreign currency exchange rates and regulations regarding the lending limits of Israeli banks to companies considered to be in an affiliated group. The Israeli government has periodically changed its policies in these areas. Reoccurrence of previous destabilizing factors could make it more difficult for the Company to operate its business and could adversely affect its business.\nSome of the Company\u2019s employees and officers are obligated to perform military reserve duty in Israel.\nGenerally, Israeli adult male citizens and permanent residents are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty up to a specified age. They also may be called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances, which could have a disruptive impact on the Company\u2019s workforce.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a non-Israeli judgment against the Company or its officers and directors.\nThe operating subsidiary of the Company is incorporated in Israel. All of the Company\u2019s executive officers and directors are not residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s assets and the assets of its executive officers and directors are located outside the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against the Company, or any of these persons, including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not necessarily be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult to affect service of process on these persons in the United States or to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to initiate an action with respect to U.S. securities laws in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws reasoning that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law often involves the testimony of expert witnesses, which can be a time consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against the Company in Israel, it may be impossible to collect any damages awarded by either a U.S. or foreign court.\nOur international operations could expose us to additional risks, including exchange rate fluctuations, legal regulations and political or economic instability that could harm our business and operating results.\nOur international operations expose us to the following risks which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:\n\u25cf devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates including fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the NIS;\n\u25cf costs of compliance with local laws, including labor laws and intellectual property laws;\n\u25cf compliance with domestic and foreign government policies, including compliance with Israeli securities laws and TASE;\n\u25cf changes in trade regulations and procedures affecting approval, production, pricing, marketing, reimbursement for and access to, our products;\n\u25cf compliance with applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, anti-trust/competition laws, anti-Boycott Israel law and anti-money laundering laws; and\n\u25cf economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including ongoing instability in global economies and financial markets, international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, and military and political alliances.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nA more active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, it has only been traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market since July 25, 2016. There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for our common stock may adversely affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell its shares of common stock at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If a more active, liquid public trading market does not develop, we may be limited in our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, if there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile and it would be harder for you to liquidate any investment in our common stock. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u25cf our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in our earnings estimates;\n\u25cf investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u25cf our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u25cf changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u25cf announcements of legislative or regulatory changes.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nSales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock may be sold into the market at any time. A substantial portion of these shares are held by two stockholders, one of which is also an executive officer of the Company. Although we believe that such executive officer has no current intention to sell a significant number of shares of our stock, we cannot provide any such assurance. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that the other large stockholder of the Company has no current intention to sell a significant number of shares of our stock. If any of the two stockholders which hold most of our shares were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time (presuming such sales were permitted) such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nFurther, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOur securities are traded on more than one market which may result in price variations.\nOur securities have been trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market since July 2016 and on TASE since September 2005. Trading in our securities on such exchanges occurs in different currencies (U.S. dollars on The Nasdaq Capital Market and NIS on the TASE), and at different times (due to different time zones, trading days and public holidays in the United States and Israel). The trading prices of our securities on the two exchanges may differ due to the foregoing and other factors. Any decrease in the price of our shares on the TASE could cause a decrease in the trading price of our shares on The Nasdaq Capital Market and vice versa.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to such companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, (i.e. a company with \u201cpublic float\u201d held by non-affiliates with a market value of less than $75 million) and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain our future earnings, if any, in order to reinvest in the development and growth of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. Investors should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Because we do not pay dividends, and there may be limited trading, investors may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on their investment. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause investors to not see any return on investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends we may have trouble raising additional funds, which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nWe can sell additional shares of common stock without consulting stockholders and without offering shares to existing stockholders, which would result in dilution of shareholders\u2019 interests in the company and could depress our stock price.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes 100,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 29,145,927 are currently outstanding, and our Board is authorized to issue additional shares of our common stock.\nAlthough our Board intends to utilize its reasonable business judgment to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to our then existing stockholders in connection with any future issuance of our capital stock, the future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock could cause immediate, and potentially substantial, dilution to our existing stockholders, which could also have a material effect on the market value of the shares.\nFurther, our shares do not have preemptive rights, which means we can sell shares of our capital stock to other persons without offering purchasers in this offering the right to purchase their proportionate share of such offered shares. Therefore, any additional sales of stock by us could dilute your ownership interest in our Company.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf variations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u25cf any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u25cf regulatory developments affecting our products; and\n\u25cf our execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments under these arrangements.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a stockholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law, as applicable, among other things:\n\u25cf provide the Board with the ability to alter the Bylaws without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf place limitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a publicly-held Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder. These provisions are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our Board. These provisions may delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our common stock and the value of our securities to decline. In addition, rules applicable to TASE listed companies also limit the terms permitted with respect to a new class of shares and prohibit any such new class of shares from having superior voting rights to the rights of the class of shares listed on TASE.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOn September 26, 2017, the Company was notified by The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that it was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notification provided that the Company had 180 calendar days, or until March 26, 2018, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nIn addition, on June 5, 2017, the Company received written notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notifying the Company that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, the Company\u2019s common stock did not maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities of $35 million per share as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). The notification provided that the Company had 180 calendar days, or until December 4, 2017, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). On December 5, 2017, the Company received a second written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that its failure to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) by December 4, 2017 would result in the Company\u2019s securities being delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market effective as of the open of business on December 14, 2017 unless the Company requested an appeal of such determination. The Company thereafter requested an appeal before the Hearings Panel, thereby staying the delisting of the Company\u2019s securities pending the Hearings Panel\u2019s decision.\nOn January 22, 2018, the Nasdaq Staff concluded that the Company had regained compliance with its Rule 5550(a)(2) based on the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock having been at $1.00 per share or greater for 10 consecutive business days from January 5, 2018 to January 19, 2018.\nIn addition, on January 26, 2018, the Nasdaq Hearings Advisor informed the Company that the Nasdaq Staff had informed them that the Company\u2019s Market Value of Listed Securities deficiency (as set forth in its Rule 5550(b)(2)) had been cured, and that the Company is in compliance with all applicable listing standards. As a result, the scheduled hearing before the Hearings Panel was cancelled.\nNo assurance can be given that we will continue to meet applicable Nasdaq continued listing standards. Failure to meet applicable Nasdaq continued listing standards could result in a delisting of our common stock. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options will have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our capital stock by existing stockholders.\nAs of March 19, 2018, we had outstanding warrants to acquire 2,826,961 shares of our common stock and stock options to purchase 3,341,996 shares of our common stock, which warrants and options are exercisable for prices ranging between $0.04 and $5.28. The expiration of the term of such options and warrants range from March 2018 to July 2022. If a significant number of such warrants and stock options are exercised by the holders, the percentage of our common stock owned by our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nOur common stock is subject to the penny stock rules which could result in U.S. broker-dealers becoming discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nSales of our currently issued and outstanding stock may become freely tradable pursuant to rule 144 and may dilute the market for your shares and have a depressive effect on the price of the shares of our common stock.\nA substantial majority of our outstanding shares of common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that an Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144(a)(1)) of an issuer who has held restricted securities for a period of at least six months (one year after filing Form 10 information with the SEC for shell companies and former shell companies) may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of a company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale (the four calendar week rule does not apply to companies quoted on the OTC Markets). Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitation, by a person who is not an Affiliate of the Company and who has satisfied a one-year holding period. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Securities Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares of common stock, may have a depressive effect upon the price of our shares of common stock in any active market that may develop.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interest because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 100,000,000 shares of common stock.\nWe may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are trading.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Any statements in Annual Report on Form 10-K about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements.
