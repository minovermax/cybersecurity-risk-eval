To the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon key customers.\nWe rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. Our top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, our top five customers accounted for 17% of our net sales. While we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. As a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. As a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products.\nOur business operates in a highly competitive industry.\nWe operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the United States and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.\nOne aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. These transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of Management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.\nAs we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business.\nWe have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. Decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. Moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. There can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. In addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers.\nA portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our U.S. railroad and transit customers meet the Positive Train Control (PTC) mandate from the U.S. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we had sales of about $290 million related to PTC. In recent years, the railroads and transit authorities have stated they cannot achieve full implementation of PTC by the deadline, and various bills have been introduced to extend it, but to date there has been no change in the deadline. Should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing, scope or requirements of the safety bill, there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods, and would cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering Positive Train Control services.\nOur revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending.\nThe railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. In economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. Reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products.\nThe passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. New passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. A substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and Amtrak. To the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us.\nOur backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues.\nOur backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods. Instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nA growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.\nIn fiscal year 2014, approximately 50% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the U.S. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. We currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. As a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including:\n\u2022\nlack of complete operating control;\n\u2022\nlack of local business experience;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u2022\nforeign trade restrictions and exchange controls;\n\u2022\ndifficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises; and\n\u2022\neconomic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows.\nWe may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. There can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. Any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us.\nWe may have liability arising from asbestos litigation.\nClaims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.\nMost of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.\nFuture climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs.\nThe Company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. The potential challenges for the Company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the Company. Any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the Company\u2019s operations. Further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products.\nOur manufacturer\u2019s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims.\nWe warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. Accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers\u2019 specifications. In addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. Although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation.\nLabor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 28% of our employees. Our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2015 through 2017. Agreements expiring at various times during 2015 cover approximately 21% of the Company\u2019s workforce. Failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. If we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. We cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. Such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business.\nFrom time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers.\nFrom time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. These disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had total debt of $521.8 million. If it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the $270.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $250.0 million 4.375% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nThe indenture for our $250 million 4.375% senior notes due in 2023 and our 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management\u2019s discretion in the operation of our businesses.\nThe indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management\u2019s discretion.\nThe 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company\u2019s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.\nThe indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.\nThe integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIn 2013 and 2014, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $522.2 million. Although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. The management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results;\n\u2022\nsignificant expenses to integrate;\n\u2022\ndiversion of Management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key personnel from the acquired business;\n\u2022\neffectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making;\n\u2022\nintegration of different information systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of assets.", "PERMNO": 81677, "SIC": 3743, "TIC": "WAB"}
