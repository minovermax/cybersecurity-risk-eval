Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as ours, a wide range of factors could affect our business and financial results. The factors described below are considered to be the most significant, but are not listed in any particular order. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Nature and Operations of Our Business\nThe state and condition of the global financial markets and fluctuations in the global and U.S. economies may have an unpredictable impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe global equity and credit markets continue to experience high levels of volatility and disruption. At various points in time, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and limited credit capacity for certain companies without regard to those companies\u2019 underlying financial strength. In addition, sluggishness in the global and U.S. economies has produced concern over public and private debt levels, high unemployment/underemployment, a drop in consumer confidence and spending, and continued slowness in the U.S. housing market. These factors have impacted corporate profits and resulted in cutbacks in advertising budgets. If the economic sluggishness and/or current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, we may experience further, potentially material, adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access capital. For example, any worsening of the economy, credit markets, continuing geopolitical uncertainty, a continuation of market volatility, or further weakness in employment or consumer spending could continue to adversely impact the overall demand for advertising. Such a result could have a negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nAny deterioration of the economy\u2019s ongoing gradual recovery could negatively impact our ability to meet our cash needs and our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in our Senior Credit Facility. If economic conditions do not continue to improve, deteriorate, or other adverse factors outside our control arise, our operations could be negatively impacted, which could prevent us from maintaining compliance with our debt covenants. If it appears that we could not meet our liquidity needs or that noncompliance with debt covenants is likely, we would implement remedial measures (as we have done in the past), which could include, but not be limited to, operating cost and capital expenditure reductions and deferrals, and seeking our share of distributions from TV One to the extent not already received (which cannot be assured). In addition, we could implement further de-leveraging actions, which may include, but not be limited to, other debt repayments, subject to our available liquidity and contractual ability to make such repayments and/or debt refinancings and amendments.\nWe have historically incurred net losses which could continue into the future.\nWe have historically reported net losses in our consolidated statements of operations, due mostly in part to recording non-cash impairment charges for write-downs to radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill, interest expenses (both cash and non-cash), net losses incurred for discontinued operations, and revenue declines caused by weakened advertising demand resulting from the current economic environment. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we experienced net losses of approximately $62.7 million, $62.0 million and $66.9 million, respectively. These results have had a negative impact on our financial condition and could be exacerbated given the current economic climate. If these trends continue in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur revenue is substantially dependent on spending and allocation decisions by advertisers, and seasonality and/or weakening economic conditions may have an impact upon our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from sales of advertisements and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers. Any reduction in advertising expenditures or changes in advertisers\u2019 spending priorities and/or allocations across different types of media or programming could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and results of operations. We do not obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers and advertisers may cancel, reduce, or postpone advertisements without penalty, which could adversely affect our revenue. Seasonal net revenue fluctuations are common in the media industries and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. In addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years tend to benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality (including the weather), combined with the severe structural changes that have occurred in the U.S. economy, make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results.\nAdvertising expenditures also tend to be cyclical and reflect general economic conditions, both nationally and locally. Because we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of advertising, a decline or delay in advertising expenditures could reduce our revenues or hinder our ability to increase these revenues. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive, financial, entertainment, and retail industries, represent a significant portion of our advertising revenues. Structural changes (such as the decreased number of automotive dealers and brands and consolidation or reduced footprints in retail) and business failures in these industries have affected our revenues and continued structural changes or business failures in any of these industries could have significant further impact on our revenues. Any political, economic, social, or technological change resulting in a significant reduction in the advertising spending of these sectors could adversely affect our advertising revenues or its ability to increase such revenues. In addition, because many of the products and services offered by our advertisers are largely discretionary items, weakening economic conditions could reduce the consumption of such products and services and, thus, reduce advertising for such products and services. Changes in advertisers\u2019 spending priorities during economic cycles (such as the current cycle) may also affect our results. Disasters (domestic or external to the United States), acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could also lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of supply or demand issues, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty.\nPricing for advertising may continue to face downward pressure.\nIn response to weakness and fluctuations in the economy, advertisers increasingly purchased lower-priced inventory rather than higher-priced inventory and demanded lower pricing, in addition to increasingly purchasing later and through advertising inventory from third-party advertising networks. If advertisers continue to demand lower-priced inventory and/or otherwise continue to put downward pressure on pricing, our operating margins and ability to generate revenue could be further adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent upon audience acceptance of our content, particularly our radio programs, which is difficult to predict.\nMedia and radio content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of media content or a radio program, and the licensing of rights to the intellectual property associated with the content or program, depend primarily upon their acceptance and perceptions by the public, which are difficult to predict. The commercial success of content or a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict.\nRatings for broadcast stations and traffic on a particular website are also factors that are weighed when advertisers determine which outlets to use and in determining the advertising rates that the outlet receives. Poor ratings or traffic levels can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenues. For example, if there is an event causing a change of programming at one of our stations, there could be no assurance that any replacement programming would generate the same level of ratings, revenues, or profitability as the previous programming. In addition, changes in ratings methodology and technology could adversely impact our ratings and negatively affect our advertising revenues.\nFinally, the costs of developing and distributing content and programming most popular with the public may change significantly if new performance royalties (such as those that have been proposed by members of Congress from time to time) are imposed upon radio broadcasters or internet operators and such changes could have a material impact upon our business.\nA disproportionate share of our radio segment revenue comes from a small number of geographic markets and from Reach Media.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 48.8% of our net revenue was generated from the sale of advertising in our core radio business, excluding Reach Media. Within our core radio business, four of the 15 markets in which we operate radio stations accounted for approximately 53.6% of our radio station net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from both the Houston and Washington, DC markets accounted for approximately 26.0% of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from four of the 15 markets in which we operate radio stations, accounted for approximately 37.7% of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adverse events or conditions (economic (including government cutbacks) or otherwise) could lead to declines in the contribution of Reach Media or declines in one or more of the significant contributing markets (Houston, Washington, DC, Atlanta and Baltimore), which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial performance and results of operations. Further, our station in the Houston and Atlanta markets have recently taken on direct competitors, which could adversely impact our results in those markets.\nWe may lose audience share and advertising revenue to our competitors.\nOur radio stations and other media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and station groups and other media such as broadcast television, newspapers, magazines, cable television, satellite television, satellite radio, outdoor advertising, the internet and direct mail. Adverse changes in audience ratings, internet traffic, and market shares could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. Larger media companies, with more financial resources than we have may enter the markets in which we operate, causing competitive pressure. Further, other media and broadcast companies may change their programming format or engage in aggressive promotional campaigns to compete directly with our media properties for audiences and advertisers. Indeed, our Houston and Atlanta markets have recently taken on direct competitors, which could adversely impact our results in those markets. Competition in any of our markets could result in lower ratings or traffic and, hence, lower advertising revenue for us, or cause us to increase promotion and other expenses and, consequently, lower our earnings and cash flow. Changes in population, demographics, audience tastes and other factors beyond our control, could also cause changes in audience ratings or market share. Failure by us to respond successfully to these changes could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue.\nWe recently changed the programming format of certain of our stations in response to demographic changes and/or significant shifts in ratings due to changes in ratings technology or new competitors. There is no assurance that these changes in programming will generate the same or better levels of ratings, revenues, or profitability as the previous programming.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate businesses pursuant to our diversification strategy, our business and prospects may be adversely impacted.\nWe are pursuing a strategy of acquiring and investing in other forms of media that complement our core radio business in an effort to grow and diversify our business and revenue streams. This strategy depends on our ability to find suitable opportunities and obtain acceptable financing. Negotiating transactions and integrating an acquired business could result in significant costs, including significant use of management\u2019s time and resources. Further, such acquisitions or investments, such as any potential buyout of our partner in TV One, could involve the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness.\nOur diversification strategy partially depends on our ability to identify attractive media properties at reasonable prices and to divest properties that are no longer strategic to our business. Further, entering new businesses may subject us to additional risk factors. Some of the material risks that could hinder our ability to implement this strategy include:\n\u00b7 continued economic sluggishness and fluctuations;\n\u00b7 limitations under the terms of our credit facilities and/or bond indentures;\n\u00b7 inability to find buyers for media properties we target for sale at attractive prices due to decreasing market prices for radio stations or the inability of a potential buyer to obtain credit in the current economic environment;\n\u00b7 failure or delays in completing acquisitions or divestitures due to difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approval, including possible difficulties by the seller or buyer in obtaining antitrust approval for acquisitions in markets where we already own multiple stations or establishing compliance with broadcast ownership rules;\n\u00b7 reduction in the number of suitable acquisition targets due to increased competition for acquisitions;\n\u00b7 we may lose key employees of acquired companies or stations;\n\u00b7 difficulty in integrating operations and systems and managing a diverse media business;\n\u00b7 failure of some acquisitions to prove profitable (or as profitable as anticipated) or generate sufficient cash flow;\n\u00b7 changes in distribution arrangements or methods for our content and across our media properties; and\n\u00b7 inability to finance acquisitions on acceptable terms, through incurring debt or issuing stock.\nWe can provide no assurance that our diversification strategy will be successful.\nWe must respond to the rapid changes in technology, services, and standards across our entire platform in order to remain competitive.\nTechnological standards across our media properties are evolving and new distribution technologies/platforms are emerging at a rapid pace. We cannot assure that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new features or services to compete with these new technologies. Several new media technologies, products and/or features are being, or have been, developed, including the following:\n\u00b7 satellite delivered digital audio radio service, which has resulted in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs;\n\u00b7 audio programming by cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite systems, internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats;\n\u00b7 digital audio and video content available for listening and/or viewing on the internet and/or off traditional delivery platforms (including via Wi-Fi, mobile phones, smart phones, netbooks, tablets and off of traditional broadcast/cable providers); and\n\u00b7 audio, video and search capabilities embedded within social media platforms.\nNew media has resulted in fragmentation in the advertising market, and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that additional competition arising from new technologies may have across any of our business segments or our financial condition and results of operations, which may be adversely affected if we are not able to adapt successfully to these new media technologies or distribution platforms. The continuing growth and evolution of channels and platforms has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other media platforms. We continually seek to develop and enhance our content offerings and distribution platforms/methodologies. Failure to effectively execute in these efforts, actions by our competitors, or other failures to deliver content effectively could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and, as a result, have adverse effects across our business.\nThe loss of key personnel, including certain on-air talent, could disrupt the management and operations of our business.\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including certain on-air personalities. We believe that the combination of skills and experience possessed by our executive officers and other key employees could be difficult to replace, and that the loss of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us, including the impairment of our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, several of our on-air personalities and syndicated radio programs hosts have large loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas and may be significantly responsible for the ratings of a station. The loss of such on-air personalities or any change in their popularity could impact the ability of the station to sell advertising and our ability to derive revenue from syndicating programs hosted by them. We cannot be assured that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current audiences or ratings.\nAs a part of our diversification strategy, we continue to develop our internet businesses. Failure to effectuate this strategy may adversely affect our brands and business prospects.\nOur diversification strategy is in part dependent upon the development of our internet businesses. In order for our internet businesses to grow and succeed over the long-term, we must, among other things:\n\u00b7 significantly increase our online traffic and revenue;\n\u00b7 attract and retain a base of frequent visitors to our websites;\n\u00b7 expand the content, products, and tools we offer on our websites;\n\u00b7 respond to competitive developments while maintaining a distinct identity across each of our online brands;\n\u00b7 attract and retain talent for critical positions;\n\u00b7 maintain and form relationships with strategic partners to attract more consumers;\n\u00b7 continue to develop and upgrade our technologies; and\n\u00b7 bring new product features to market in a timely manner.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in achieving these and other necessary objectives. If we are not successful in achieving these objectives, our business, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf our internet segment does not continue to develop and offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services, our advertising revenues could be adversely affected.\nIn order to attract internet consumers and generate increased activity on our internet properties, we believe that we must offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services. However, acquiring, developing, and offering such content, products and services may require significant costs and time to develop, while consumer tastes may be difficult to predict and are subject to rapid change. If we are unable to provide content, products and services that are sufficiently attractive to our internet users, we may not be able to generate the increases in activity necessary to generate increased advertising revenues. In addition, although we have access to certain content provided by our other businesses, we may be required to make substantial payments to license such content. Many of our content arrangements with third parties are non-exclusive, so competitors may be able to offer similar or identical content. If we are not able to acquire or develop compelling content and do so at reasonable prices, or if other companies offer content that is similar to that provided by our internet segment, we may not be able to attract and increase the engagement of internet consumers on our internet properties.\nContinued growth in our internet advertising business also depends on our ability to continue offering a competitive and distinctive range of advertising products and services for advertisers and publishers and our ability to maintain or increase prices for our advertising products and services. Continuing to develop and improve these products and services may require significant time and costs. If we cannot continue to develop and improve its advertising products and services or if prices for its advertising products and services decrease, our internet advertising revenues could be adversely affected.\nMore individuals are using devices other than personal and laptop computers to access and use the internet, and, if we cannot make our products and services available and attractive to consumers via these alternative devices, our internet advertising revenues could be adversely affected.\nInternet users are increasingly accessing and using the internet through devices other than a personal or laptop computer, such as mobile tablets and smartphones, which differ from computers with respect to memory, functionality, resolution and screen size. In order for consumers to access and use our products and services via these alternative devices, we must ensure that our products and services are technologically compatible with such devices. If we cannot effectively make our products and services available on alternative devices, fewer internet consumers may access and use our products and services and our advertising revenue may be negatively affected.\nUnrelated third parties may claim that we infringe on their rights based on the nature and content of information posted on websites we maintain.\nWe host internet services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on our content, and engage in various online activities. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally. While we monitor postings to such websites, claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that may be posted online or generated by our users. Our defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nIf we are unable to protect our domain names, our reputation and brands could be adversely affected.\nWe currently hold various domain name registrations relating to our brands, including radio-one.com and interactiveone.com. The registration and maintenance of domain names are generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to register or maintain relevant domain names. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from registering domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brands, and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and our services.\nFuture asset impairment to the carrying values of our FCC licenses and goodwill could adversely impact our results of operations and net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $666.8 million in broadcast licenses and $275.4 million in goodwill, which totaled $942.2 million, and represented approximately 67.4% of our total assets. Therefore, we believe estimating the fair value of goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses is a critical accounting estimate because of the significance of their carrying values in relation to our total assets. We did not record any impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe are required to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which we have traditionally done in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis when events or changes in circumstances suggest impairment may have occurred. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value. Impairment may result from deterioration in our performance, changes in anticipated future cash flows, changes in business plans, adverse economic or market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, or other factors beyond our control. The amount of any impairment must be expensed as a charge to operations. Fair values of FCC licenses and goodwill have been estimated using the income approach, which involves a 10-year model that incorporates several judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. We also utilize a market-based approach to evaluate our fair value estimates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analysis.\nFor the first, second and third quarters in 2014 and 2013, the total market revenue growth for certain markets in which we operate was below that used in our prior year annual impairment testing. In each quarter, we deemed that to be an impairment indicator that warranted interim impairment testing of certain markets\u2019 radio broadcasting licenses, which we performed as of each quarter-end date. There was no impairment identified as part of this testing in 2014. We recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.4 million related to our Cincinnati FCC radio broadcasting licenses during the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $9.8 million related to our Philadelphia, Cincinnati and Cleveland radio broadcasting licenses during the second quarter of 2013. Finally, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $3.7 million related to our Boston and Cleveland radio broadcasting licenses during the third quarter of 2013. The remaining radio broadcasting licenses that were tested during 2013 were not impaired. There were no impairment indicators present for any of our other radio broadcasting licenses. The results of our annual impairment testing as of October 1, 2014, indicated that the carrying value for our radio broadcasting licenses, as well as goodwill associated with all reporting units had not been impaired. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded impairment charges against radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill of approximately $0, $14.9 million and $313,000, respectively.\nChanges in certain events or circumstances could result in changes to our estimated fair values, and may result in further write-downs to the carrying values of these assets. Additional impairment charges could adversely affect our financial results, financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nIf material weaknesses or significant control deficiencies occur in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We did not maintain adequate internal controls with regard to the review of the preparation of the condensed consolidating financial statements of guarantors in the footnotes to our previously filed financial statements in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the \u201c2012 10-K\u201d). As a result, we restated our condensed consolidating footnote in our 2012 10-K and in our Forms 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, and March 31, 2013, respectively. In response to this material weakness, we have restructured our Finance and Accounting functions and engaged additional resources with the appropriate depth of experience for our Finance and Accounting departments, updated our accounting policies and procedures to ensure that accounting personnel have sufficient guidance to remediate the previously communicated weakness and to appropriately evaluate all disclosure requirements, and implemented a required senior management, legal and accounting review to specifically address all disclosures and related financial information. We cannot assure you that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses. If other material weaknesses or other significant control deficiencies occur, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDisruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise customer information, and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer.\nAny internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted externally at third party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs or reduced revenues. Our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.\nIn addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we may collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our customers and employees. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed, and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Any compromise of our technology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to customers\u2019, employees\u2019, or business partners\u2019 information. Any such loss, disclosure, misappropriation, or access could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupting operations and damaging our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure (including our billing systems) are important to the operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures or cyber-attacks. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service offerings and the diversion of development resources. We rely on third parties for developing key components of these systems and ongoing service after their implementation. Third parties may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruption and/or failure of any of these new systems could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our services, retain our current subscribers and attract new subscribers. In addition, although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks including, among other things, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, computer denial of service attacks, and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our customer and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses.\nWe seek to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult, and the steps we take may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. We have taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. However, protection of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our products, services, and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nOur business depends on maintaining our licenses with the FCC. We could be prevented from operating a radio station if we fail to maintain its license.\nWithin our primary business, we are required to maintain radio broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC. These licenses are ordinarily issued for a maximum term of eight years and are renewable. Currently, subject to renewal, our radio broadcasting licenses expire beginning in October 2019, and others expire at various times through August 1, 2022. While we anticipate receiving all renewals, interested third parties may challenge our renewal applications. In addition, we are subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC with respect to such matters as programming, indecency standards, technical operations, employment and business practices. If we or any of our significant stockholders, officers, or directors violate the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations or the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d), or is convicted of a felony, the FCC may commence a proceeding to impose fines or other sanctions upon us. Examples of possible sanctions include the imposition of fines, the renewal of one or more of our broadcasting licenses for a term of fewer than eight years or the revocation of our broadcast licenses. If the FCC were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license, we would be required to cease operating the radio station covered by the license only after we had exhausted administrative and judicial review without success.\nThe FCC\u2019s media ownership rules could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations.\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own (directly or by attribution) in any market and require FCC approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses. The FCC\u2019s media ownership rules remain subject to further agency and court proceedings. In March 2014, the FCC commenced its most recent quadrennial review of its media ownership rules to seek public comment on and evaluate such rules to determine whether any changes are warranted. See the information contained in \u201cBusiness-Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting.\u201d\nAs a result of the FCC media ownership rules, the outside media interests of our officers and directors could limit our ability to acquire stations. The filing of petitions or complaints against Radio One or any FCC licensee from which we are acquiring a station could result in the FCC delaying the grant of, refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses. The Communications Act and FCC rules and policies also impose limitations on non-U.S. ownership and voting of our capital stock.\nIncreased enforcement by the FCC of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry could adversely affect our business operations.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television broadcast stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC\u2019s indecency and profanity definitions, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC has in the past vigorously enforced its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against broadcast licensees for \u201cserious\u201d indecency violations. In 2004 the FCC indicated that it was enhancing its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency. The FCC has found on a number of occasions that the content of broadcasts has contained indecent material. In such instances, the FCC has issued fines or advisory warnings to the offending broadcast licensees. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines against broadcasters for each allegedly indecent \u201cutterance,\u201d in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which, while setting aside certain FCC indecency enforcement actions on narrow due process grounds, declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCC\u2019s indecency policies. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the FCC requested public comment on the appropriate substance and scope of its indecency enforcement policy. It is not possible to predict whether and, if so, how the FCC will revise its indecency enforcement policies or the effect of any such changes on us. The fines for broadcasting indecent material are a maximum of $325,000 per utterance. The determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. The difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the FCC\u2019s indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to our ability to comply with the rules. Violation of the indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, third parties could oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations on the grounds that we broadcast allegedly indecent programming on our stations.\nChanges in current federal regulations could adversely affect our business operations.\nCongress and the FCC have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies that could, directly or indirectly, affect the profitability of our broadcast stations. In particular, Congress may consider and adopt a revocation of terrestrial radio\u2019s exemption from paying royalties to performing artists and record companies for use of their recordings (radio already pays a royalty to songwriters, composers and publishers). In addition, commercial radio broadcasters and entities representing artists are negotiating agreements that could result in broadcast stations paying royalties to artists. A requirement to pay additional royalties could have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. Moreover, it is possible that our license fees and negotiating costs associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming could sharply increase as a result of private negotiations, one or more regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. We cannot predict whether such increases will occur.\nNew or changing federal, state or international privacy legislation or regulation could hinder the growth of our internet business.\nA variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our internet business uses to operate its services and to deliver certain advertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially disparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are now pending at both the federal and state level in the U.S. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements could hinder the growth of our internet business. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or requirements or with our own policies and procedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers.\nOur operation of various real properties and facilities could lead to environmental liability.\nAs the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Governance Structure\nTwo common stockholders have a majority voting interest in Radio One and have the power to control matters on which our common stockholders may vote, and their interests may conflict with yours.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our Chairperson and her son, our President and CEO, collectively held approximately 95% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. As a result, our Chairperson and our CEO control our management and policies and decisions involving or impacting upon Radio One, including transactions involving a change of control, such as a sale or merger. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders and our debtholders. In addition, certain covenants in our debt instruments require that our Chairperson and the CEO maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in Radio One, and prohibit other parties\u2019 voting interests from exceeding specified amounts. In addition, the TV One operating agreement provides for adverse consequences to Radio One in the event our Chairperson and CEO fail to maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in us. Our Chairperson and the CEO have agreed to vote their shares together in elections of members to the Board of Directors of Radio One.\nFurther, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under rules governing the listing of our securities on the NASDAQ Stock Market because more than 50% of our voting power is held by our Chairperson and the CEO. Therefore, we are not subject to NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors on the board; (ii) a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board\u2019s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. While a majority of our board members are currently independent directors, we do not make any assurances that a majority of our board members will be independent directors at any given time.\nRisks Related to Our Investment in TV One\nTV One has substantial indebtedness that we are required to reflect in our total consolidated indebtedness. Certain restrictions in the indenture governing the TV One indebtedness could impact upon TV One\u2019s ability to make distributions to us.\nOn February 25, 2011, TV One incurred $119.0 million of indebtedness in connection with the redemption of certain of its financial investor and management members. The debt was issued in a private offering in the form of the TV One Notes. Until the issuance of the TV One Notes, TV One operated without any long-term indebtedness. With our majority interest in TV One, we are required to reflect TV One\u2019s indebtedness in our total consolidated indebtedness. Further, the indenture governing the TV One Notes contains certain covenants that could impact upon TV One\u2019s operations, including its ability to make distributions. Under the terms of such indenture, TV One is permitted to make distributions to us so long as, at the time of and after giving effect to such distribution to us: (i) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such distribution; (ii) the consolidated EBITDA of TV One for the most recent four-quarter period for which internal financial statements are available, was greater than $25 million; and (iii) TV One would have at least $5.0 million of liquidity on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such distribution to us. While we currently do not foresee these restrictions prohibiting TV One from making distributions to us, to the extent the restrictions do prohibit TV One from making distributions to us, it could impact our overall liquidity and our ability to maintain compliance under the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, including our revolving credit facility and the notes following the completion of this offering.\nWe may not realize all of the expected benefits from our investment in TV One.\nWe believe that the TV One investment will provide us with a number of benefits, including helping us realize our operating strategy of becoming a multi-media entertainment and information content provider to African-American consumers. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the TV One investment will depend on TV One\u2019s success. Our management is and continues to be required to devote significant attention and resources to these efforts, which may disrupt our other businesses. If our investment in TV One is not executed effectively, it could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of this investment may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the efforts required to realize the benefits of our investment in TV One may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention, and a material negative impact on our consolidated results of operations. Beginning at the end of 2014, we or Comcast, our partner in TV One, can demand an appraisal of TV One. Such a demand could trigger an event whereby we buy out Comcast from the partnership or they buy out our remaining interest in the partnership. We cannot assure you of the outcome of this event and whether we will retain our interest in TV One or obtain a greater interest in TV One.\nOur ability to control the operations of TV One is limited by the rights of our partners.\nOur ability to operate and otherwise fully integrate the operations of TV One with our operations is limited by the terms of our agreements with our partner, Comcast. We own approximately 52.1% of TV One and hold two of its three board seats. However, the operations of TV One could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected to the extent we become involved in disputes with our partner regarding the strategic direction or operations of TV One. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any new commercial arrangements with TV One in the future. The Board of Directors of TV One, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties to all of the equity holders of TV One, may take actions that may not always be in our best interests and such actions could lead to outcomes that have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe consolidate the financial results of TV One into our own in accordance with GAAP as a result of our approximately 52.1% controlling ownership interest in TV One. This causes the total assets and liabilities on our balance sheet to appear larger than they would otherwise and our statement of operations to reflect larger revenues and expenses than would be the case absent such consolidation. In that regard, we note that we will include our proportionate share of TV One\u2019s earnings in calculating and reporting our net income and Adjusted EBITDA, although we will only be entitled to include its earnings in calculating our net income for purposes of the indenture governing the notes to the extent such earnings have been distributed to us for so long as TV One is not considered a \u201cRestricted Subsidiary\u201d under such indenture. In addition, the operating agreement (and related agreements) that created and governs TV One contains certain limited conditions under which such distributions may be made, and certain restrictions in the indenture governing the TV One Notes could also impact upon TV One\u2019s ability to make distributions to us.\nA decline in advertising expenditures could cause TV One\u2019s revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period.\nTV One derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. Disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of economic uncertainty. Advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences, particularly with increased competition and fragmentation due to new content distribution platforms. In addition, advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive and financial segments, represent a significant portion of TV One\u2019s advertising revenues. Any political, economic, social, or technological change resulting in a reduction in these sectors\u2019 advertising expenditures may adversely affect TV One\u2019s revenue. Advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising may also be affected by a decline in audience ratings for TV One\u2019s programming, the inability of TV One to retain the rights to popular programming, increasing audience fragmentation caused by the proliferation of new media formats, including other cable networks, the internet and video-on-demand, and the deployment of portable digital devices and new technologies, which allow consumers to time shift programming, make and store digital copies and skip or fast-forward through advertisements. Any reduction in advertising expenditures could have an adverse effect on TV One\u2019s revenues and results of operations.\nTV One\u2019s success is dependent upon audience acceptance of its content, which is difficult to predict.\nTelevision content production is inherently a risky business because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a television program and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property depend primarily upon the public\u2019s level of acceptance, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a television program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs in the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the advertising rates that TV One receives. Poor ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenues. Consequently, low public acceptance of TV One\u2019s content may have an adverse effect on TV One\u2019s results of operations. Further, recent competitive network launches, such as the networks launched by Oprah Winfrey (OWNTM), Sean Combs (REVOLT TVTM), and Magic Johnson (ASPIRETM), could take away from our audience share and ratings and thus have an adverse effect on TV One\u2019s results of operations.\nThe loss of affiliation agreements could materially adversely affect TV One\u2019s results of operations.\nTV One is dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with cable and direct broadcast distributors for its revenues, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such distributors. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could reduce the distribution of TV One\u2019s programming services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. Further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscribers and associated subscriber fees. In addition, consolidation among cable distributors and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect TV One\u2019s ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Since its inception, TV One has not gone through a renewal process with respect to its affiliation agreements. Some of its major affiliation agreements will soon be up for renewal, and the results of TV One\u2019s renewal process could have a material adverse effect on TV One\u2019s revenues and results and operations. We cannot assure you that TV One will be able to renew its affiliation agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of a significant number of these arrangements or the loss of carriage on basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of our content, which may adversely affect our revenues from subscriber fees and our ability to sell national and local advertising time.\nChanges in consumer behavior resulting from new technologies and distribution platforms may impact the performance of our businesses.\nTV One faces emerging competition from other providers of digital media, some of which have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In particular, content offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved. Providers such as HuluTM, NetflixTM, AppleTM, AmazonTM and GoogleTM, as well as gaming and other consoles such as Microsoft\u2019s XboxTM, Sony\u2019s PS4TM, Nintendo\u2019s WiiTM, and RokuTM, are aggressively establishing themselves as alternative providers of video services, including online TV services. Most recently, Dish NetworksTM has released a new online distribution service called Sling TVTM offering live sports and other content without paying for a tradition cable bundle of channels. These services and the growing availability of online content, coupled with an expanding market for mobile devices and tablets that allow users to view content on an on-demand basis and internet-connected televisions, may impact TV One\u2019s distribution for its services and content. Additionally, devices or services that allow users to view television programs away from traditional cable providers or on a time-shifted basis and technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, such as DVRs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content, have caused changes in consumer behavior that may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues. If we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to TV One\u2019s target audiences, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities that TV One depends upon to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect TV One\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nTV One uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to affiliates. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites, and downlinks. Transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather, that impair on-ground uplinks or downlinks, or as a result of an impairment of a satellite. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If a disruption occurs, TV One may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. Failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on TV One\u2019s businesses and results of operations. In addition, TV One uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction. Failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on TV One\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nTV One\u2019s operating results are subject to seasonal variations and other factors.\nTV One\u2019s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences on people\u2019s viewing habits. Typically, TV One revenue from advertising increases in the fourth quarter. In addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect TV One\u2019s businesses and customers.\nThe United States continues to experience sluggishness and volatility in its economy. These factors could lead to lower consumer and business spending for TV One\u2019s products and services, particularly if customers, including advertisers, subscribers, licensees, retailers, and other consumers of TV One\u2019s offerings and services, reduce demands for TV One\u2019s products and services. In addition, in unfavorable economic environments, TV One\u2019s customers may have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations and may face insolvency, all of which could impair their ability to make timely payments and continue operations. TV One is unable to predict the duration and severity of weakened economic conditions, and such conditions and resultant effects could adversely impact TV One\u2019s businesses, operating results, and financial condition.\nIncreased programming and content costs may adversely affect TV One\u2019s profits.\nTV One produces and acquires programming (including motion pictures) and content and incurs costs for all types of creative talent, including actors, authors, writers and producers as well as marketing and distribution. An increase in any of these costs may lead to decreased profitability.\nPiracy of TV One\u2019s programming and other content, including digital and internet piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of TV One\u2019s programming and other content and adversely affect its businesses and profitability.\nPiracy of programming is prevalent in many parts of the world and is made easier by the availability of digital copies of content and technological advances allowing conversion of such programming and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of TV One\u2019s content. The proliferation of unauthorized copies and piracy of these products has an adverse effect on TV One\u2019s businesses and profitability because these products reduce the revenue that TV One potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services. In addition, if piracy were to increase, it would have an adverse effect on TV One\u2019s businesses and profitability.\nChanges in U.S. communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on TV One\u2019s business.\nThe television and distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation of TV One. For example, the FCC has initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising such as product placement and product integration. Enhanced restrictions affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect TV One\u2019s advertising revenues. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by TV One. Proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned by cable distribution systems) to all cable program services. TV One\u2019s ability to obtain the most favorable terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law. TV One is unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on its operations.\nVigorous enforcement or enhancement of FCC indecency and other program content rules against the broadcast and cable industries could have an adverse effect on TV One\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nThe FCC has in the past vigorously enforced its indecency rules against the broadcast industry. See \u201cRisks Related to Regulation-Increased enforcement by the FCC of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry could adversely affect our business operations.\u201d Some policymakers support the extension of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or otherwise expand existing laws and rules. If such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement, or other expansion took place and was found to be constitutional, some of TV One\u2019s content could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels.\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer has an interest in TV One that may conflict with your interests.\nWe have an employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alfred C. Liggins, III. The employment agreement provides, among other things, that in recognition of Mr. Liggins\u2019 contributions in founding TV One on our behalf, he is eligible to receive an award amount equal to 8% of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of our aggregate investment in TV One. Our obligation to pay the award will be triggered only after our recovery of the aggregate amount of its capital contribution in TV One and only upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable securities or proceeds from a liquidity event with respect to our membership interest in TV One. Mr. Liggins\u2019 rights to the TV One Award (i) cease if he is terminated for cause or he resigns without good reason and (ii) expire at the termination of his employment agreement (but similar rights could be included in the terms of a new employment agreement). As a result of this arrangement, the interest of Mr. Liggins\u2019 with respect to TV One may conflict with your interests as holders of our debt or equity securities. For example, Mr. Liggins may seek to have Radio One acquire additional equity interests in TV One using cash generated from operations or additional borrowings under its credit facilities or have TV One itself pursue acquisitions, joint ventures, financings or other transactions that, in his judgment, could increase the amount of the TV One Award by increasing the amount of our investment in TV One or enhancing the equity value of TV One, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our equity or debt securities.", "PERMNO": 88372, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "UONEK"}
