{"cik": "927653", "company": "MCKESSON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-05-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe discussion below identifies certain representative risks that might cause our actual business results to materially differ from our estimates. It is not practical to identify or describe all risks and uncertainties that might materially impact our business operations, reputation, financial position or results of operations. Our business could be materially affected by risks that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider to be immaterial. This is not a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks\nWe experience costly and disruptive legal disputes.\nWe are routinely named as a defendant in litigation or regulatory proceedings and other legal disputes, which may include asserted class action litigation, such as those described in Financial Note 19, \u201cCommitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Regulatory proceedings might involve allegations such as false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, and antitrust violations. Civil litigation proceedings might involve commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, tort and other claims. Despite valid defenses that we assert, legal disputes are often costly, time-consuming, distracting to management and disruptive to normal business operations. The outcome of legal disputes is difficult to predict. Outcomes can occur that are not justified by the evidence or existing law. The uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal disputes might harm our business and reputation even if the matter is favorably resolved. Accordingly, any legal dispute might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might experience losses not covered by insurance.\nOur business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. For example, pharmacy operations are exposed to risks such as improper filling of prescriptions, mislabeling of prescriptions, inadequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. Although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage, such as property insurance for inventory and professional and general liability insurance, coverages on acceptable terms might be unavailable, or coverages might not cover our losses. We generally seek to limit our contractual exposure, but limitations of liability or indemnity provisions in our contracts may not be enforceable or adequately protect us from liability. Uninsured losses might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe experience costly legal disputes, government actions and adverse publicity regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids.\nThe Company is a defendant in approximately 3,200 cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids), as described in Financial Note 19, \u201cCommitments and Contingent Liabilities,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this report. We regularly are named as a defendant in similar, new cases. The plaintiffs in those cases include governmental entities (such as states, provinces, counties and municipalities) as well as businesses, groups and individuals. The cases allege violations of controlled substance laws and other laws, and they make common law claims such as negligence and public nuisance. Many of these cases raise novel theories of liability. Any proceedings can have unexpected outcomes that are not justified by evidence or existing law. All proceedings involve significant expense, management time and distraction, and risk of loss that can be difficult to predict or quantify. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. Proceedings can result in monetary damages, penalties and fines, and injunctive or other relief. Although the Company has valid defenses and is vigorously defending itself, some proceedings have been and others may be resolved by negotiated outcome. Our reputation has been and may continue to be impacted by publicity regarding the litigation and related allegations. The adverse outcome of legal proceedings might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nWe might experience increased costs to distribute controlled substances such as opioids.\nLegislative, regulatory or industry measures related to the distribution of controlled substances such as prescription opioids could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. For example, some states have passed legislation that could require us to pay taxes or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states and other states have considered similar legislation. Liabilities for taxes or assessments or other costs of compliance under any such laws might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive, complex and challenging healthcare and other laws.\nOur industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the Company to litigation and regulatory investigations. For example, we are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations, including those relating to radiation-emitting equipment operated at U.S. Oncology Network practices. Additionally, we are subject to various routine agency (e.g., Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d)) inspections to determine compliance with various federal regulations. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse.\nLocal, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving or allegedly involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose many restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many of these laws, regulations, and government guidance, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. The laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. Failures to comply with applicable laws subject us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions, and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. These sanctions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might lose our ability to purchase, compound, store or distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.\nWe are subject to the operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) and other comparable agencies. Certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, FDA, HHS, CMS, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. For example, we are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. Noncompliance with these requirements has resulted in monetary penalties and/or licensing sanctions. For example, under a January 2017 agreement with the DEA and Department of Justice we paid $150 million to settle potential administrative and civil claims about our practices for reporting suspicious orders of controlled substances and the DEA suspended, on a staggered basis for limited periods of time, our registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four distribution centers. As of March 31, 2021, suspensions at the four distribution centers had all expired by their own terms. If we are not able to obtain, maintain or renew permits, licenses or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses, it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nPedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs.\nThere have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. For example, the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (\u201cDQSA\u201d) requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies, such as track and trace or authentication technologies, to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. We also have record-keeping and other obligations under the E.U. Falsified Medicines Directive. Pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs, and they might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nPrivacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden.\nWe are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) we must maintain administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information (\u201cprotected health information\u201d) and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union (\u201cGDPR\u201d), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d) in Canada, and the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions. We are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various government agencies. Failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, and other costs. We also have contractual obligations to customers that might be breached if we fail to comply with privacy laws. Our efforts to comply with privacy laws complicates our operations and adds to our compliance costs. A significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy laws might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nAnti-bribery and anti-corruption laws increase our compliance burden.\nWe are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. The U.K. Bribery Act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. Our failure to comply with these laws might subject us to civil and criminal penalties that might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nCompany and Operational Risks\nWe might record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, intangibles and other assets or investments.\nWe are required under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. In addition, we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture, indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, burdensome new laws or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. There are inherent uncertainties in management\u2019s estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, a deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and exacerbated uncertainties inherent in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in our forecasts and impairment assessments. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible and other long-lived assets is determined, which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe experience cybersecurity incidents that might significantly compromise our technology systems or might result in material data breaches.\nWe and our external service providers use technology and systems to perform our business operations, such as the secure electronic transmission, processing, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information and other types of personal information, confidential financial information, proprietary information, and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. Despite physical, technical, and administrative security measures, our technology systems and operations have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to cyberattacks from sources beyond our control. Cybersecurity incidents include actual or attempted unauthorized access, tampering, malware insertion, ransomware attacks or other system integrity events. The risk of cyberattacks may be increased due to a variety of factors, both internal and external. A cybersecurity incident might involve a material data breach or other material impact to the integrity and operations of our technology systems, which might result in litigation or regulatory action, loss of customers or revenue, and increased expense, any of which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, reputation, and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might experience significant problems with information systems or networks.\nWe rely on sophisticated information systems and networks to perform our business operations, such as to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data that facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from distribution centers. If those information systems suffer errors, interruptions, or become unavailable, there might be a materially adverse impact on our business operations, reputation, and our financial position or results of operations.\nOur products or services might not conform to specifications or perform as we intend.\nWe sell and provide services involving complex software and technology that may contain errors, especially when first introduced to market. Healthcare professionals delivering patient care tend to have heightened sensitivity to system and software errors. If our software and technology services are alleged to have contributed to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we might be subject to claims or litigation by users of our software or services or their patients. Errors or failures might damage our reputation and negatively affect future sales. A failure of a system or software to conform to specifications might constitute a breach of warranty that could result in repair costs, contract termination, refunds of amounts previously paid or claims for damages. Any of these types of errors or failures might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nWe might be impeded in providing customers online services and data access.\nWe provide remote services that involve hosting customer data and operating software on our own or third party systems. Our customers rely on their ability to access the systems and their data as needed. The networks and hosting systems are vulnerable to interruption or damage from sources beyond our control, such as power loss, telecommunications failures, fire, natural disasters, software and hardware failures and cyberattacks. If the timely delivery of medical care or other customer business requirements are impaired by data access, network or systems problems, we could be exposed to significant claims and reputational harm. Any such problems might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might not realize expected benefits from business process initiatives.\nWe may implement restructuring, cost reduction or other business process initiatives that might result in extraordinary charges and expenses, failures to achieve our desired objectives, or unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be unable to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions or other business combinations.\nOur growth strategy includes consummating acquisitions or other business combinations that either expand or complement our business. To fund acquisitions, we may require financing that may not be available on acceptable terms. We may not receive regulatory approvals needed to complete proposed transactions, or such approvals may be subject to delays or conditions that reduce transaction benefits. Achieving the desired outcomes of business combinations involves significant risks including: diverting management\u2019s attention from other business operations; challenges with assimilating the acquired businesses, such as integration of operations and systems; failure or delay in realizing operating synergies; difficulty retaining key acquired company personnel; unanticipated accounting or financial systems issues with the acquired business, which might affect our internal controls over financial reporting; unanticipated compliance issues in the acquired business; challenges retaining customers of the acquired business; unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings, including depreciation and amortization or potential impairment charges; and risks of known and unknown assumed liabilities in the acquired business. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nExclusive forum provisions in our Bylaws could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for specified legal actions is the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware if the Court of Chancery does not have or declines to accept jurisdiction (collectively, \u201cDelaware Courts\u201d). Current and former stockholders are deemed to have consented to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in connection with any action to enforce that exclusive forum provision and to service of process in any such action. These provisions of the bylaws are not a waiver of, and do not relieve anyone of duties to comply with, federal securities laws including those specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts under the Exchange Act and concurrent jurisdiction of federal and state courts under the Securities Act. To the extent that these provisions of the bylaws limit a current or former stockholder\u2019s ability to select a judicial forum other than the Delaware Courts, they might discourage the specified legal actions, might cause current or former stockholders to incur additional litigation-related expenses and might result in outcomes unfavorable to current or former stockholders. A court might determine that these provisions of the bylaws are inapplicable or unenforceable in any particular action, in which case we may incur additional litigation related expenses in such action, and the action may result in outcomes unfavorable to us, which could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nWe might be adversely impacted by delays or other difficulties with divestitures.\nWhen we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. After the disposition, we might experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue or profit might be larger than we expected. We might have difficulties with pre-closing conditions such as regulatory and governmental approvals, which could delay or prevent the divestiture. We might have financial exposure in a divested business, such as through minority equity ownership, financial or performance guarantees, indemnities or other obligations, such that conditions outside of our control might negate the expected benefits of the disposition. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of a divestiture and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might not realize the expected tax treatment from our split-off of Change Healthcare.\nOn March 10, 2020, the Company completed a separation of its interest in Change Healthcare LLC (\u201cChange Healthcare JV\u201d). The divestiture was effected through the split-off of PF2 SpinCo, Inc. (\u201cSpinCo\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that held all of the Company\u2019s interest in the Change Healthcare JV, to certain of the Company\u2019s stockholders through an exchange offer (the \u201cExchange Offer\u201d), followed by a merger of SpinCo with and into Change Healthcare Inc. (\u201cChange\u201d), with Change surviving the merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d and, together with the Exchange Offer, the \u201cTransactions\u201d). The Company received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that the Transactions qualified as generally tax-free transactions to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An opinion of legal counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the intended tax-free treatment of the Transactions. In addition, the opinion could not be relied upon if certain assumptions, representations and undertakings upon which the opinion was based are materially inaccurate or incomplete, or are violated in any material respect. If the intended tax-free treatment of the Transactions is not sustained, the Company and its stockholders who participated in the Transactions may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes. In connection with the Transactions, the Company, SpinCo, Change and the Change Healthcare JV entered into the Tax Matters Agreement, which governs their respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, Change is required to indemnify the Company if the Transactions become taxable as a result of certain actions by Change or SpinCo, or as a result of certain changes in ownership of the stock of Change after the Merger. If Change does not honor its obligations to indemnify the Company, or if the Transactions fail to qualify for the intended tax-free treatment for reasons not related to a disqualifying action by Change or SpinCo, the resulting tax to the Company could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by outsourcing or similar third-party relationships.\nWe rely on third parties to perform certain business and administrative functions for us. We might not adequately develop, implement and monitor these outsourced service providers, and we might not realize expected cost savings or other benefits. Third-party services providers might fail to perform as anticipated, or we might experience unanticipated operational difficulties, compliance requirements or increased costs related to outsourced services. For example, our ability to use outsourcing resources in certain jurisdictions might be limited by legislative action or customer contracts, with the result that the work must be performed at greater expense or we may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy operations or maintaining profitability.\nOur business strategy included expanding our retail pharmacy operations. Our retail pharmacy operations involve numerous risks, such as the following ones. We might encounter difficulties attracting and retaining customers to our retail locations due to their unfamiliarity with our brands or our inexperience with local market preferences. Competition from our retail pharmacy operations might strain relationships with our retail pharmacy customers. Consolidation of retail pharmacies with third party payers, expansion of large retail pharmacy networks, reductions in reimbursement rates, shifts in the mix of branded and generic pharmaceutical sales, and exclusion from preferred pharmacy networks can impair our retail pharmacy sales and profitability. Failure to maintain profitable retail pharmacy operations may result in significant costs, including those associated with site closures and reductions in workforce. If our retail pharmacy operations fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nWe might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from, and have a significant portion of our accounts receivable with, a small number of customers. At March 31, 2021, sales to our largest customer represented approximately 21% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 19% of our trade receivables, and those of our ten largest customers combined accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 32% of our trade receivables. A material default in payment, reduction in purchases, or the loss of business from a large customer might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nOur contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks.\nOur contracts with government entities are subject to risks such as lack of funding and compliance with unique requirements. For example, government contract purchase obligations are typically subject to the availability of funding, which may be eliminated or reduced. In addition, the future volume of products or services purchased by a government customer is uncertain. Our government contracts might not be renewed or might be terminated for convenience with little or no prior notice. Government contracts typically expose us to higher potential liability than do other types of contracts. In addition, government contracts typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting and other requirements. For example, our contracts with the U.S. government generally require us to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Procurement Integrity Act, Buy American Act, Trade Agreements Act, and other laws and regulations. We are subject to government audits, investigations and oversight proceedings. Government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or we fail an audit, we are subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages, criminal and civil penalties, termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work. These requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our reputation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nOur participation in vaccination distribution programs may materially affect our operating results, reputation, and business.\nWe participate as a distributor in government-sponsored vaccination programs, such as the U.S. government\u2019s COVID-19 distribution program (\u201cFederal COVID-19 Response\u201d). We also provide supplies used for vaccine administration in the Federal COVID-19 Response. Our participation in such programs exposes us to various uncertainties. For example, the novel nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the broad scope of the ongoing COVID-19 vaccine distribution program introduce uncertainty about what volumes of products may become available for distribution by us, the effectiveness of vaccines, and the cost of distribution. Because of such uncertainties, our operating results may be subject to variability. Our participation in such programs also exposes us to various risks, including regulatory compliance, government oversight, dependence on government funding, contractual performance, litigation, security risks, and supply chain challenges. Any significant problems with our participation in such programs might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and our business. Because of these risks and uncertainties our operating results may be materially higher or lower than our projections.\nWe might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers.\nWe attempt to structure our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. Certain distribution agreements with manufacturers include pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation, and we cannot control the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price changes. We might be unable to renew pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers in a timely and favorable manner. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nWe might infringe intellectual property rights or our intellectual property protections might be inadequate.\nWe believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and may do so in the future. If a court were to hold that we infringed other\u2019s rights, we might be required to pay substantial damages, develop non-infringing products or services, obtain a license, stop selling or using the infringing products or services, or incur other sanctions. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure obligations and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. We might initiate costly and time-consuming litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property protection efforts might be inadequate to protect our rights. Our competitors might develop non-infringing products or services equivalent or superior to ours. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to attract, engage, develop and retain qualified and experienced employees, including key executives and other talent, is essential for us to meet our objectives. We compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees. Competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries, benefits or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain employees. We may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes, such as illness, and must adequately plan for succession of key management roles. Employees might not successfully transition into new roles. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nWe might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models.\nMany of our products and services are designed and intended to function within the structure of current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. The healthcare industry and related government programs are changing. Some of these changes increase our risks and create uncertainties for our business.\nFor example, some changes in reimbursement methodologies (including government rates) for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services reduce profit margins for us and our customers and impose new legal requirements on healthcare providers. Those changes have included cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the basis for payments, shifting away from fee-for-service and towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and increases in the use of managed care.\nIn the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. There are continued efforts to challenge the ACA. There are also efforts to broaden healthcare coverage. U.S. lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices, including requiring price transparency and drug importation measures. These proposals might result in significant changes in the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers, PBM, managed care organizations and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models.\nProvincial governments in Canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. For example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers.\nMany European governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs. Some European governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending. These measures exert pressure on the pricing and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nAlthough there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood, timing and results of these health reform efforts, their implementation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by competition and industry consolidation.\nOur businesses face a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. In addition, our businesses face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. Due to consolidation, a few large suppliers control a significant share of the pharmaceuticals market. This concentration reduces our ability to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and causes us to depend on a smaller number of suppliers. Many of our customers, including healthcare organizations, have consolidated and have greater power to negotiate favorable prices. Consolidation by our customers, suppliers and competitors might reduce the number of market participants and give the remaining enterprises greater bargaining power, which might lead to erosion in our profit margin. Consolidation might increase counter-party credit risk because credit purchases increase for fewer market participants. These competitive pressures and industry consolidation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply.\nOur supply arrangements might be interrupted or adversely affected by a variety of causes over which we have no control, such as export controls or trade sanctions, labor disputes, unavailability of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure raw materials, quality control concerns, ethical sourcing issues, supplier\u2019s financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war. Our inventory might be requisitioned, diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations. For example, government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affect our supply allocation, and those and our own allocation decisions can impact our customer relationships. Changes in the healthcare industry\u2019s or our suppliers\u2019 pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. We might experience disruptions in our supply of higher margin pharmaceuticals, including generic pharmaceuticals. Any of these changes or disruptions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals.\nOur generic pharmaceuticals distribution business is subject to pricing risks. We might be adversely impacted if our ClarusONE generic pharmaceutical sourcing joint venture with Walmart, Inc. is unsuccessful or experiences margins declines. Generic drug manufacturers often offer a generic version of branded pharmaceuticals while they challenge the validity or enforceability branded pharmaceutical patents. The patent holder might assert infringement claims against us for distributing those generic versions and the generic drug manufactures may not fully indemnify us against such claims. These risks, as well as changes in the availability, pricing volatility, reimbursement rates for generic drugs, or significant changes in the nature, frequency or magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches, might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by an economic slowdown or recession.\nAn economic slowdown or recession affecting our businesses in one or more regions could reduce the prices our customers are able or willing to pay for our products and services and the volume of their purchases. This risk is increased by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any economic slowdown or recession might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nDisruption or other changes in capital and credit markets might impede access to credit and increase borrowing costs for us and our customers and suppliers and might impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers.\nVolatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by financial institutions, or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market, might adversely affect our borrowing ability and cost of borrowing. We generally sell our products and services under short-term unsecured credit arrangements. An adverse change in general economic conditions or access to capital might cause our customers to reduce their purchases from us, or delay or fail paying amounts owed to us. Suppliers might increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale due to limited availability of credit. Suppliers might be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. These risks are increased by the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest rate increases or changes in capital market conditions might impede our or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 ability or cost to obtain credit. Any of these risks might have a material adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may have difficulties in sourcing or selling products due to a variety of causes.\nWe might experience difficulties and delays in sourcing and selling products due to a variety of causes, such as: difficulties in complying with the legal requirements for export or import of pharmaceuticals or components; suppliers\u2019 failure to satisfy production demand; manufacturing or supply problems such as inadequate resources; and real or perceived quality issues. Difficulties in product manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in supplier production shutdowns, product shortages and other supply disruptions. The FDA banned certain manufacturers from selling raw materials and drug ingredients in the U.S. due to quality issues. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the availability of some products, resulting in product allocation and delivery delays. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to the tax laws in the U.S. at the federal, state and local government levels and to the tax laws of many other jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services. Tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate and cash flow. The tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us. Our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities, we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges, and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts. Developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by the Brexit withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.\nWe have operations in the U.K. and the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) and face risks associated with the uncertainty and potential disruptions that might follow the U.K. withdrawing from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). Brexit could adversely affect political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. For example, we might experience volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and changes in laws regulating our U.K. operations. Customers might reduce purchases due to the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe conduct our business in various currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollars. For example, we are exposed to transactional currency exchange risk due to our import and export of products that are purchased or sold in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We also have currency exchange risk due to intercompany loans denominated in various currencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and might increase currency exchange rate volatility. We may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts, foreign currency borrowings or other techniques intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. These hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nMcKESSON CORPORATION\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe might be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues, natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events.\nWe might be adversely affected by events outside of our control, including: widespread public health issues, such as epidemic or pandemic infectious diseases; natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or severe weather; political events such as terrorism, military conflicts and trade wars; and other catastrophic events. These events can disrupt operations for us, our suppliers, our vendors, and our customers. For example, in February 2021, a severe winter storm affecting the United States temporarily impacted our distribution business operations, primarily in Texas. They might affect consumer confidence levels and spending. In response to these events, we might suspend operations, implement extraordinary procedures, seek alternate sources for product supply, or suffer consequences that are unexpected and difficult to mitigate. In particular, the rapid and widespread transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus beginning in late 2019 impacts us in significant ways. For example, to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, we implemented travel restrictions and remote working arrangements for most of our employees in order to minimize physical contact, and we implemented additional sanitation and personal protection measures in our warehouse, retail pharmacy and delivery operations. These measures might not fully mitigate COVID-19 risks to our workforce and we could experience unusual levels of absenteeism that might impair operations and delay delivery of products. The COVID-19 pandemic affects product manufacturing, supply and transport availability and cost. The pandemic reduces demand for some products due to delays or cancellations of elective medical procedures, consumer self-isolation and business closures, among other reasons. The COVID-19 pandemic influences shortages of some products, with product allocation resulting in delivery delays for customers. The ongoing impacts of the pandemic might cause a general economic slowdown or recession in one or more markets, disruptions and volatility in global capital markets and other broad and adverse effects on the economy, business conditions, commercial activity and the healthcare industry. The pandemic might impact our business operation, financial position and results of operation in unpredictable ways that depend on highly uncertain future developments, such as determining the effectiveness of current or future government actions to address the public health or economic impacts of the pandemic. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.\nThe long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) and other adverse effects. The effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. We bear losses incurred as a result of, for example, physical damage to or destruction of our facilities (such as distribution or fulfillment centers), loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change. These events and impacts could materially adversely affect our business operations, financial position or results of operation.\nWe might be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards.\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which periodically is revised or reinterpreted. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC. It is possible that future accounting standards may require changes to the accounting treatment in our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our financial systems. Such changes might have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 81061, "SIC": 5122, "TIC": "MCK"}
