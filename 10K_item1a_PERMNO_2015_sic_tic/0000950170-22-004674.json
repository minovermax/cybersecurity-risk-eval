{"cik": "895447", "company": "SHOE CARNIVAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nCarefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks actually occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. See PART I \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our risk factors are categorized as follows: Operational and Strategic Risks, Compliance and Litigation Risks, Human Capital Risks, Financial and Liquidity Risks and Risks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock.\nOperational and Strategic Risks\nAdverse impacts on consumer spending may significantly harm our business. The success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the level of consumer spending. A number of factors may affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer, including, among other things:\n\u2022war, terrorism, civil unrest, other hostilities and security concerns;\n\u2022inflation;\n\u2022the timing and level of government stimulus payments;\n\u2022energy costs, which affect gasoline and home heating prices;\n\u2022general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022unemployment trends and salaries and wage rates;\n\u2022the level of consumer debt;\n\u2022consumer credit availability;\n\u2022real estate values and foreclosure rates;\n\u2022consumer confidence in future economic conditions;\n\u2022interest rates;\n\u2022health care costs;\n\u2022tax rates, policies and timing and amounts of tax refunds; and\n\u2022natural disasters, changing weather patterns and catastrophic events.\nThe merchandise we sell generally consists of discretionary items. Adverse economic conditions and macroeconomic uncertainty, and any related decrease in consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced consumer demand for discretionary items. Federal stimulus payments made directly to consumers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic likely had a positive impact on our net sales, including in fiscal 2021. The amount of any future stimulus payments and duration of the impact of such payments is uncertain, and our sales and profitability may decline in future periods. Furthermore, the increasing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and/or rising inflation could also erode consumer confidence and lead to lower levels of discretionary income for our customers and reduce the demand for our merchandise. Reduced consumer demand could result in reduced traffic in our physical stores and to our e-commerce platform; limit the prices we can charge for our merchandise; result in inventory markdowns and increased selling and promotional expenses; and cause us to close underperforming stores, which could result in higher than anticipated closing costs. Any of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business and our results of operations.\nOur operations and the markets in which we operate, procure merchandise and raise capital are continuing to experience significant disruption and financial market volatility associated with the outbreak of a novel strain of\ncoronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The U.S. Government, as well as state and local governments, have taken unprecedented measures to control the spread of COVID-19 and to provide stimulus as a mitigating measure to deteriorating economic conditions and increasing unemployment. Many businesses, schools, and other institutions closed, or adjusted operations, to further the practice of \u201csocial distancing\u201d as a method to slow the outbreak. Our business and results of operations were significantly impacted by the temporary closure of our physical stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As guidance and mandates from governments and public health officials continue to evolve, closures to some, or all, of our store and other operations may reoccur. In addition, our stock price and the stock prices of our peer companies have been volatile.\nThe extent of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the duration and spread of the outbreak in the areas in which we operate and whether there are additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of such cases in future periods;\n\u2022mitigating efforts deployed by government agencies and the public at large, including vaccine or testing mandates;\n\u2022the development, pace of distribution, and effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic treatments; and\n\u2022the general perception of those mitigating efforts where we operate, procure merchandise and raise capital.\nShould the COVID-19 pandemic lead to further temporary closures of our physical stores; financial market volatility; adverse changes in economic conditions; adverse changes in consumer spending; increased operational risks; and/or further disruptions to our supply chain and distribution processes, our costs may increase, our sales and gross profit may decline and our stock price may decrease, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur customers and store employees are exposed to certain COVID-19-related safety risks at our physical stores. While we have taken measures to control these risks, the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 may result in unexpected outcomes. For example, if the established protocols cease to be effective, or are not followed, the health and safety of our employees and customers could be at risk. A future outbreak in our stores, distribution center, or corporate headquarters could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or store or facility closures. Inadequate response by us, perceived or otherwise, could impact our costs, our reputation, and/or our ability to recruit a qualified workforce.\nAn increase in the cost, or a disruption in the flow, of imported goods may decrease our sales and profits. We rely on imported goods to sell in our stores. Substantially all of our footwear product is manufactured overseas, including the merchandise we import directly from overseas manufacturers and the merchandise we purchase from domestic vendors. Our primary footwear manufacturers are located in China. Currently, most retailers, including us, are experiencing some form of disruption in their supply chains involving goods imported from Asian countries. To date, such disruption has increased our costs but has not materially impacted our access to merchandise; however, should the disruption continue or worsen, it may further increase the cost of the goods we purchase, limit our ability to acquire merchandise, and decrease our sales and profits.\nIf imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable, the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands. Products from alternative sources may be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import. Other risks associated with our use of imported goods include:\n\u2022disruptions in the flow of imported goods because of factors such as electricity or raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes, political unrest, war, pandemics and natural disasters;\n\u2022tariffs, import duties, import quotas, anti-dumping duties, and other trade sanctions;\n\u2022modifications to international trade policy and/or existing trade agreements and other changes affecting United States trade relations with other countries;\n\u2022problems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages and piracy;\n\u2022port congestion at arrival ports causing delays;\n\u2022additional oceanic shipping costs to reach non-congested ports;\n\u2022inland transit costs and delays resulting from port congestion;\n\u2022economic crises and international disputes;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from the failure to maintain normal trade relations with source countries;\n\u2022increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans-Pacific shipping cartel; and\n\u2022compliance with the laws and regulations, and changes to such laws and regulations, in the United States and the countries where our manufacturers are located, including but not limited to requirements relating to shipping security, product safety testing, environmental requirements and anti-corruption laws.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the Shoe Station business and realizing the expected operating results, growth opportunities and other benefits of the acquisition. The success of the Shoe Station acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the expected operating results, growth opportunities and other benefits from acquiring the Shoe Station assets. We may not realize these operating results, growth opportunities or other benefits within the expected time frames, or at all. The acquisition may disrupt our current plans and operations and may negatively impact our relationship with our vendors and other key suppliers. The attention of our management may be diverted from our current operations while trying to integrate the Shoe Station business. We may not be able to successfully integrate Shoe Station\u2019s operations, logistics, information technologies, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems, establish internal controls into Shoe Station\u2019s operations or retain key Shoe Station employees. The acquired Shoe Station business may underperform relative to our expectations. Any of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our growth opportunities, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition in our markets, and we may be unable to compete favorably. The retail footwear industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete primarily with department stores, shoe stores, sporting goods stores, e-commerce retailers and mass merchandisers. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. Economic pressures or bankruptcies of our competition could result in increased pricing pressures. This competition could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nOur failure to identify fashion trends could result in lower sales, higher markdowns and lower gross profits. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and react to the fashion tastes of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer fashion preferences may result in lower sales, higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories and lower gross profits. Conversely, if we fail to anticipate or react to consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages, which would result in lost sales and could negatively affect our customer goodwill, our brand image and our profitability. Moreover, our business relies on continuous changes in fashion preferences. Stagnating consumer preferences could also result in lower sales and would require us to take higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories.\nFailure to successfully manage and execute our marketing initiatives could have a negative impact on our business. Our success and growth are partially dependent on generating customer traffic in order to gain sales momentum in our physical stores and drive traffic to our e-commerce platform. Successful marketing efforts require the ability to reach customers through their desired mode of communication, utilizing various media outlets. Media placement decisions are generally made months in advance of the scheduled release date. Our inability to accurately predict our customers\u2019 preferences, to utilize their desired mode of communication, or to ensure availability of advertised products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our competitors may spend more on marketing or use different marketing approaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage.\nOur failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our results of operations. Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy. All of our stores are subject to leases and are primarily located in open-air shopping centers. If we fail to effectively implement our real estate strategies or negotiate appropriate lease terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could have an adverse effect on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. The financial impact of exiting a leased location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property and our relationship with the landlord, and influencing these factors is difficult. In addition to rent, we could still be responsible for the maintenance, taxes, insurance and common area maintenance (\u201cCAM\u201d) charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated.\nWe locate our stores primarily in open-air shopping centers where we believe our customers and potential customers shop. The success of an individual store can depend on favorable placement within a given open-air shopping center and the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in the open-air shopping centers where our stores are located. We cannot control the development of alternative shopping destinations near our existing stores or the availability or cost of real estate within existing or new shopping destinations. If one or more of the destination retailers or anchor stores located in the open-air shopping centers where our stores are located close or leave, or if there is significant deterioration of the surrounding areas in which our stores are located, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, if our store locations fail to attract sufficient customer traffic or we are unable to locate replacement locations on terms acceptable to us, our business could suffer.\nVarious risks associated with our e-commerce platform may adversely affect our business and results of operations. E-commerce has been a rapidly growing sales channel and an increasing source of competition in the retail industry. We sell shoes and related accessories through our website at www.shoecarnival.com and our related mobile app. We fulfill substantially all e-commerce orders from our store locations and from our distribution center. If we are unable to maintain recent market share gains in our e-commerce sales or continue to grow our e-commerce sales, our sales, comparable store sales and gross profit may decline, and our stock price may decrease, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur e-commerce operations are subject to numerous other risks that could have an impact on our results of operations, including:\n\u2022unanticipated operating problems;\n\u2022reliance on third-party computer hardware, software and service providers;\n\u2022the need to continually invest in technology and security;\n\u2022our ability to hire, retain and train personnel to conduct our e-commerce operations;\n\u2022diversion of sales from our physical stores;\n\u2022our ability to manage any upgrades or other technological changes;\n\u2022our ability to provide customer-facing technology systems, including mobile technology solutions, that function reliably and provide a convenient and consistent experience for our customers;\n\u2022exposure to potential liability for online content;\n\u2022risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our e-commerce platform and the related support systems, including computer viruses, telecommunication failures and cyberattacks and break-ins and similar disruptions; and\n\u2022security risks related to our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information.\nAny significant interruptions in the operations of our third-party providers, over which we have no control, could have an adverse effect on our e-commerce business. Any breach involving our customer information could harm our reputation or result in liability including, but not limited to, fines, penalties and costs of litigation, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nA failure to increase sales at our existing stores may adversely affect our stock price and affect our results of operations. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable store sales results, including:\n\u2022competition;\n\u2022timing of holidays, including sales tax holidays;\n\u2022general regional and national economic conditions, including inflation;\n\u2022inclement weather and/or unseasonable weather patterns;\n\u2022consumer trends, such as less disposable income due to the impact of higher prices on consumer goods;\n\u2022fashion trends;\n\u2022changes in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022our ability to efficiently distribute merchandise;\n\u2022timing and type of, and customer response to, sales events, promotional activities or other advertising;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our inventory management;\n\u2022new merchandise introductions; and\n\u2022our ability to execute our business strategy effectively.\nOur comparable store sales results have fluctuated in the past, and we believe such fluctuations may continue. The unpredictability of our comparable store sales may cause our revenue and results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in revenues or operating income may cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.\nMembers in our Shoe Perks customer loyalty program account for a significant portion of our sales, and any material decline in sales from our Shoe Perks members could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We believe our Shoe Perks rewards program provides our customers with a heightened shopping experience, which includes exclusive offers and personalized messaging. Rewards are earned by making purchases and participating in other point earning opportunities that facilitate engagement with our brand. We remain focused on expanding our Shoe Perks enrollment. If our Shoe Perks members do not continue to shop with us, our sales may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We intend to continue to invest in our omnichannel initiatives, which requires substantial investment in technology.\nOur growth strategy requires that we continue to expand and improve our operating and financial systems and expand, train and manage our employee base. In addition, as we create more opportunities to connect with our customers through our omnichannel initiatives and as we adjust the number of our physical stores, we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified personnel or successfully integrate the omnichannel initiatives or new or acquired stores into our business.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely effected. The success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of other factors, many of which are out of our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022the acceptance of our banners and concepts in new markets;\n\u2022our ability to provide adequate distribution to support growth;\n\u2022our ability to source sufficient levels of inventory;\n\u2022our ability to resolve downtime or technical issues related to our e-commerce platform, our order management and fulfillment systems, and all other related systems that support our omnichannel strategy;\n\u2022our ability to execute omnichannel advertising and marketing campaigns to effectively communicate our message to our customers and our employees;\n\u2022our ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate store leases (for new stores and renewals) on favorable terms;\n\u2022particularly if we expand into new markets, our ability to open a sufficient number of new stores to provide the critical mass needed for efficient advertising and effective brand recognition;\n\u2022the availability of financing for capital expenditures and working capital requirements;\n\u2022our ability to improve costs and timing associated with opening new stores; and\n\u2022the impact of new stores on sales or profitability of existing stores in the same market.\nWe depend on our key suppliers for merchandise and advertising support and the loss of key suppliers could adversely affect our business. Our business depends upon our ability to purchase fashionable, name brand and other merchandise at competitive prices from our suppliers. Two branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively accounted for approximately 39% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and approximately 43% in fiscal 2020 (Nike, Inc. approximately 28% in fiscal 2021 and 33% in fiscal 2020 and Skechers USA, Inc. approximately 11% in fiscal 2021 and 10% in fiscal 2020). Name brand suppliers also provide us with cooperative advertising and visual merchandising funds. Certain key suppliers\u2019 business models are changing and such changes include, but are not limited to, increased direct-to-consumer initiatives, changes in planned product allocations, and reductions in the number of retailers with which they are choosing to do business. A loss of any of our key suppliers in certain product categories or our inability to obtain name brand or other merchandise from suppliers at competitive prices could have an adverse effect on our business. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers.\nWe may not be able to identify or consummate future acquisitions or achieve expected benefits from or effectively integrate future acquisitions. From time to time, we expect to evaluate selective acquisitions and strategic investments. Future acquisitions involve many risks that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:\n\u2022our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, prevail against competing potential acquirers and negotiate and consummate acquisitions on terms attractive to us;\n\u2022any acquired business not achieving anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flow or market share;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, vendors or suppliers of the acquired company or adverse effects on our existing relationships with our vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022the failure of our due diligence procedures to detect material issues related to the acquired business, including exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition;\n\u2022unexpected liabilities resulting from the acquisition for which we may not be adequately indemnified;\n\u2022the integration of the personnel, operations, logistics, information technologies, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems and the establishment of internal controls into the acquired company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022the diversion of management attention and financial resources from our current operations;\n\u2022the potential incurrence of debt to fund an acquisition;\n\u2022any unforeseen management and operational difficulties; and\n\u2022incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-offs of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets that could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur inability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions and other investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNatural disasters, other public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend and could impact our supply chain and access to customers. Our facilities, including our distribution center, our corporate headquarters and our retail stores, and the facilities of our third-party vendors and service providers could suffer if affected by:\n\u2022natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, power shortages or outages, floods, monsoons, ice storms or tornadoes;\n\u2022other public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics;\n\u2022political crises such as terrorism, war, political instability, civil unrest or other conflict; or\n\u2022other events outside of our control.\nDisasters occurring at our distribution center, our corporate headquarters, our retail stores, or the infrastructure of a key third-party vendor or service provider also could result in us being unable to deliver merchandise to our stores or directly to customers for a prolonged period and could impact our reputation and our customers\u2019 perception of our brand. In the event of a severe disruption resulting from such events, we have contingency plans and employ crisis management to respond and recover operations. Despite these measures, if such an occurrence were to occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected if our information technology systems fail to operate effectively, are disrupted or are compromised. We rely on our existing information technology systems in operating and monitoring major aspects of our business, including sales, warehousing, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment, point-of-sale support and financial systems. We regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace our systems as well as leverage new technologies to support our operational strategies. Any delays or difficulties with such projects could have an adverse effect on our operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nThe reliability and capacity of our information technology systems, and in particular our distribution technology operations, are critical to our continued operations. We currently operate a single distribution center in Evansville, Indiana. Virtually all merchandise received by our physical stores is, and will be, shipped through our distribution center. We fulfill substantially all of our e-commerce orders from our store locations and our distribution center. Our corporate computer network is essential to our distribution process.\nDespite our precautionary efforts, our information technology systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, natural or man-made disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, power outages, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and security breaches, which may require significant investment to fix or replace.\nIf our distribution center is shut down for any reason, if our information technology systems do not operate effectively, or if we are the target of attacks or security breaches, we may suffer the loss of critical data, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores, our ability to operate our e-commerce platform may be impacted, and we could experience other interruptions or delays to our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial performance.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors and have certain business relationships that subject us to risks, including disruptions to our business and increased costs. We rely on third-party suppliers for our merchandise and outsource some of our business processes to third-party vendors. Our relationships with these business partners expose us to risks, including disruptions in our business and increased costs. In addition, other matters involving our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022changes in the public\u2019s perception of the reputation and brand of the business partner as a result of matters such as its labor and wage standards, business practices or marketing campaigns;\n\u2022our inability to properly manage a business partner;\n\u2022any data losses or information security lapses by a business partner that results in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive information; and\n\u2022any misconduct by a business partner involving matters such as fraud or other improper or unethical activities conducted by the business partner or its non-compliance with our policies and procedures or with laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of information, labor practices, environmental, health or safety matters and lobbying or similar activities.\nFailure of our business partners to provide adequate services or our inability to arrange for alternative providers on favorable terms in a timely manner could disrupt our business, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nFailure to maintain positive brand perception and recognition could have a negative impact on our business. Maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications that provide access to a broad audience of consumers and other persons. The rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to the dissemination of negative information about us via social media or any other incidents negatively impacting our reputation and brand, we may suffer declines in customer loyalty and traffic and we may experience vendor relationship issues and other issues, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy, all of which could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with customers and the public in general. Failure to use social media effectively could negatively impact our brand value and revenues.\nEmerging technologies may create disruption to the retail industry. New and emerging technology may enable new approaches or choices for how our customers procure goods and services and pay for those goods and services. We may be unable to quickly adapt to rapid change resulting from artificial intelligence, blockchain, Internet of Things, including voice and smart home devices, and other advanced technologies that may result in changes to our supply chain, distribution channels, and point-of-sale capabilities.\nOur quarterly operating results can fluctuate due to seasonality, weather conditions and other factors. Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily as a result of seasonal variances, weather conditions and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores and closing existing stores.\nWe have three distinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school and Christmas. To prepare for our peak shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other periods of the year. Reductions in demand for our merchandise during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and margins and negatively affect our profitability. Our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods, and our quarterly results may be impacted by calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods.\nWe also increase our inventory levels to offer styles particularly suited for the relevant season, such as sandals in the early summer season and boots during the winter season. If the weather conditions for a particular season vary significantly from those typical for such season, such as an unusually cold early summer or an unusually warm winter, consumer demand for the seasonally appropriate merchandise that we have available in our stores could be adversely affected and negatively impact net sales and margins. Lower demand for seasonally appropriate merchandise may leave us with an excess inventory of our seasonally appropriate products, forcing us to sell these products at significantly discounted prices and adversely affecting our net sales margins and operating cash flow.\nConversely, if weather conditions permit us to sell our seasonal product early in the season, this may reduce inventory levels needed to meet our customers\u2019 needs later in that same season. Consequently, our results of operations are highly dependent on somewhat predictable weather conditions and our ability to react to changes in weather conditions.\nOther factors that may affect our quarterly results of operations include:\n\u2022fashion trends;\n\u2022the timing and amount of income tax refunds to customers;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our inventory management;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending patterns; and\n\u2022actions of competitors or co-tenants.\nIf our future quarterly results fail to meet the expectations of research analysts, then the market price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nWe are exposed to physical and financial risks related to the uncertainty of climate change. A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our retail, distribution, and corporate locations. These impacts could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022population shifts;\n\u2022changes in the level of annual rainfall;\n\u2022changes in the overall average temperature; and\n\u2022changes to the frequency and severity of weather events such as hurricanes and other wind related events, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and ice storms that can damage our facilities and impact our supply chain and distribution channels.\nSuch changes could impact us in a number of ways including limiting available real estate; changing the demographics of our customer base and employees; increasing the likelihood of capital expenditures to replace damaged infrastructure; and increasing the cost of insurance.\nCompliance and Litigation Risks\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers and employees could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation. We receive and maintain certain personal, sensitive and confidential information about our customers, vendors and employees. The collection and use of this information are regulated and are subject to certain contractual restrictions in third-party contracts. Non-compliance with these regulations and contractual restrictions may subject us to fines, penalties, restrictions and expulsion from credit card acceptance programs and civil liability. Although we have implemented processes to collect and protect the integrity and security of this personal information, there can be no assurance that this information will not be obtained by unauthorized persons, or collected or used inappropriately, including as a result of cybersecurity breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, credit card fraud or phishing. Advanced cybersecurity threats are persistent and continue to evolve, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. If our security and information systems or the systems of our employees or external business partners are compromised or our employees or external business partners fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons, or collected or used inappropriately, our reputation, as well as our operations and financial results, could be negatively affected and litigation or regulatory action against us or the imposition of costs, fines or other penalties could also occur. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to remain in compliance.\nWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for all potential liabilities. Natural risks, as well as other hazards associated with our operations, can result in personal injury, severe damage or destruction to our owned assets, leasehold improvements and inventory, suspension of our operations, and cybersecurity breaches. Our insurance covers costs relating to specified, limited matters, such as events involving casualty losses and property losses due to fire and windstorms, as well as securities litigation and certain cybersecurity incidents, but does not cover other events such as acts of war or terrorist attacks. We maintain an amount of insurance protection we believe is appropriate, but there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not adequately insured could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Further, due to the cyclical nature and current hardening of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently in place.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources. We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require us to devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nHuman Capital Risks\nOur failure to manage key executive succession and retention could adversely affect our business. We recently completed transitions of key members of our executive management team. Our business would be adversely affected if we fail to retain key executives, or to adequately plan for the succession of the other members of our executive management team. While we have succession plans in place for members of our executive management team, and continue to review and update those plans, and we have employment agreements with certain key executive officers, these plans and agreements do not guarantee that the services of our executive officers will continue to be available to us or that we will be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business. Our business model requires us to train, motivate and manage our employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified managerial and merchandising personnel. Our ability to control costs and meet our labor needs in a rising wage and inflationary environment is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates paid by those with whom we compete for talent, health care and minimum wage legislation, and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain quality sales associates and management or market conditions or changes to minimum wage laws result in the need for higher wages paid to employees, our ability to meet growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be compromised and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nWe will require significant funds to implement our business strategy and meet our other liquidity needs. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient borrowings under our credit facility to finance our business strategy and meet our other liquidity needs. Failure to generate or raise sufficient funds may require us to modify, delay or abandon some of our future growth or expenditure plans. We utilize our credit facility to fund working capital, including inventory purchases, and special purpose standby letters of credit, as needed. Significant decreases in cash flow from operations could result in our borrowing under the credit facility to fund operational needs. If we borrow funds under our credit facility and interest rates materially increase from present levels, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nContinued financial market volatility could have an adverse effect on the sources and costs of financing available to us. The capital and credit markets have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and disruption, which could have the following impacts, among other things:\n\u2022make obtaining other sources of debt more difficult; and\n\u2022increasing our borrowing costs or limiting other potential sources of financing available to us.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges. Periodically, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, and certain intangible assets, such as goodwill, are evaluated annually regardless of triggering events. Significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets (such as store relocations or closures) have resulted, and in the future may result, in impairment charges. Any such impairment charges, if significant, would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. We must continue to document, test and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual reports by management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and expect that we will continue to expend, significant management time and resources documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. If we conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it could result in lost investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability and completeness of our financial reports. Any such events could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nPerception of the overall retail industry and other macroeconomic conditions may impact our stock price and operations. The retail industry continues to evolve and undergo structural change. This evolution and structural change has resulted in the bankruptcy and/or reorganization of various footwear specific and other publicly traded retailers. Despite our best efforts to differentiate our business model and processes, our stock price has fluctuated as a result of perceptions of the overall retail environment and investor confidence in the retail sector. The volatility in our stock price could be exacerbated by macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally or our industry in particular and could have the effect of diverting management\u2019s attention and could harm our business. We cannot provide any assurance that perception of the retail industry overall and other macroeconomic conditions will not continue to impact our stock price or our ability to engage business partners on terms acceptable to us.\nOur stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially. The stock market has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline, including:\n\u2022operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter;\n\u2022downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u2022material announcements by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022the other risk factors cited in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe price of our common stock may decline and the value of any investment in our common stock may be reduced regardless of our performance. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we become involved in securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, thus harming our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to make dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Our Board of Directors determines if it is in our best interest to pay a dividend to our shareholders and the amount of any dividend and declares all dividend payments. In the future, our results of operations and financial condition may not allow for a dividend to be declared or the Board of Directors may decide not to continue to declare dividends. In addition, our current share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $50 million of our common stock through December 31, 2022. However, we are not obligated to make any purchases under the share repurchase program and the program may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nWe are controlled by our principal shareholders. J. Wayne Weaver, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, and his spouse together beneficially own approximately 30.2% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Weaver\u2019s adult daughter is the sole trustee of the J. Wayne Weaver 2018 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust for Leigh Anne Weaver, the sole trustee of the J. Wayne Weaver 2019 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust for Leigh Anne Weaver and the sole trustee of the J. Wayne Weaver 2020 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust for Leigh Anne Weaver, and, as a result, beneficially owns approximately 5.3% of our outstanding common stock held by such trusts. Accordingly, the Weaver family is able to exert substantial influence over our management and operations. In addition, their interests may differ from, or be opposed to, the interests of our other shareholders, and their ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that may be favored by other shareholders.\nProvisions of our organizational documents and Indiana law might deter acquisition bids for us. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, our By-Laws and Indiana corporate laws contain provisions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us, including, without limitation, a Board of Directors that has staggered terms for its members, supermajority voting provisions, restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders and procedural requirements in connection with shareholder proposals or director nominations. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series without the approval of the holders of our common stock. Further, Indiana corporate law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder\u2019s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors. Indiana corporate law also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition is approved. In certain circumstances, the fact that corporate devices are in place that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 79007, "SIC": 5661, "TIC": "SCVL"}
