You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our common stock and growth prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Veltassa\u00ae (patiromer) for oral suspension and Our Business, Limited Operating History, Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our first and only drug, Veltassa\u00ae (patiromer) for oral suspension, or Veltassa.\nWe are dependent on the successful commercialization of our first and only drug, Veltassa, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on October 21, 2015 for the treatment of hyperkalemia, a life-threatening condition defined as abnormally elevated levels of potassium in the blood. Veltassa became available for prescription on December 21, 2015. The commercial success of Veltassa will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour ability to effectively execute our plans for commercialization of Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe extent of market acceptance of Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe commercial impact of the prescribing information for Veltassa, including the boxed warning and limitation of use;\n\u00b7\nthe commercial impact of the dosing separation of Veltassa from other oral medications;\n\u00b7\nthe commercial impact of the results of our human drug-drug interaction, or DDI, studies for Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nour ability to incentivize and retain commercial and medical affairs personnel, including sales representatives;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our own, and our vendors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019, marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u00b7\nthe commercial impact of our outpatient distribution model through our patient support center, Veltassa Konnect, and specialty pharmacies, and our hospital distribution model through specialty distributors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and sustain an adequate level of reimbursement coverage for Veltassa by government and commercial payers;\n\u00b7\nthe price of Veltassa and the ability of patients to afford out-of-pocket costs associated with the product;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u00b7\naccess to a sufficient number of target physicians to prescribe Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects of Veltassa;\n\u00b7\na continued acceptable safety profile of Veltassa and our ability to report and monitor the safety profile of the product;\n\u00b7\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manage costs to enable us to achieve profitability;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to continue to develop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture appropriate quantities of Veltassa using commercially validated processes and at a scale sufficient to meet demand and at a cost that enables us to achieve profitability;\n\u00b7\nour ability to ensure that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers Veltassa to meet anticipated demand in both inpatient and outpatient prescribing settings;\n\u00b7\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance for filing, and timely review, of a Marketing Authorization Application with the European Medicines Agency, which we and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd., or VFMCRP, plan to submit in the first half of 2016;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to Veltassa; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference or patent infringement claims.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will ever be able to generate meaningful revenue through the sale of Veltassa. If we are not successful in commercializing Veltassa, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nVeltassa, or any future product candidates, may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success, which will depend, in part, upon the degree of acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payers and the medical community.\nVeltassa, or any future product candidates, may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payers and the medical community, and may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of Veltassa, or any future product candidates for which we receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our products over current treatment options or alternative treatments, including future alternative treatments, such as, in the case of Veltassa, the impact on the product\u2019s potential and perceived advantages as a result of the prescribing information, including the boxed warning and limitation of use;\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials and, in the case of Veltassa, the efficacy of the product with a single starting dose for all patients;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects and overall safety profile of the product;\n\u00b7\nthe indications for which the product is approved;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe relative effectiveness, convenience and ease of our patient support services and processes for Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for our products, if approved, on the part of payers and patients;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of our products and their ability to meet market demand, including a reliable supply for long-term daily treatment with Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our marketing, sales and market access organizations; and\n\u00b7\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nAny failure by Veltassa, or any future product candidates that obtain regulatory approval, to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe prescribing information for Veltassa contains a boxed warning, which may adversely affect the commercial success of the product and our business and may materially harm our results of operations.\nThe prescribing information for Veltassa includes a boxed warning that Veltassa binds to many other orally administered medications. This binding could decrease the gastrointestinal absorption and reduce the efficacy of such other oral medications. The prescribing information for Veltassa instructs that it should be taken at least six hours before or six hours after other oral medications, and that Veltassa or the other oral medication should be chosen if adequate dosing separation is not possible.\nAs part of our development of Veltassa, we initially completed 18 rat studies and six in vitro tests (conducted in test tubes). The rat studies showed modest binding with two of 18 drugs, valsartan and rosiglitazone, and the initial in vitro tests showed no binding between Veltassa and the six drugs tested, which included valsartan. In preparation for our Phase 3 clinical studies and in parallel to our initial studies, we conducted additional in vitro DDI tests to evaluate 28 drugs for interactions with Veltassa, with such drugs being considered representative of many drug classes. The proposed list of 28 drugs was discussed with the FDA at various times during the clinical development process. In these additional in vitro tests, we tested the most extreme binding conditions, with the highest clinical dose of Veltassa tested against the lowest clinical dose of the drug being tested. In these additional in vitro tests, half of the drugs tested showed no binding and the other half showed moderate to strong binding. We did not observe any clinically meaningful DDIs in our clinical studies, although our clinical studies were not designed to examine the clinical impact of DDIs directly.\nIn September 2015, we initiated Phase 1 in vivo (conducted in humans) DDI studies to evaluate whether Veltassa binds to certain drugs in humans that showed moderate to strong binding in our in vitro tests. Such human DDI studies were conducted with the following drugs: amlodipine, clopidogrel, cinacalcet, ciprofloxacin, furosemide, levothyroxine, lithium, metformin, metroprolol, trimethoprim, verapamil and warfarin. In January 2016, we announced the results from these studies. When Veltassa was administered at the same time as the drugs being tested, there was no clinically meaningful reduction in absorption for nine of the 12 drugs. Three drugs showed reduced absorption when they were co-administered with Veltassa, however, when dosing of Veltassa and these drugs was separated by 3 hours, no reduction in absorption was observed.\nIn February 2016, we discussed the results of our Phase 1 DDI studies with the FDA. Based on the discussion, we plan to submit a sNDA by mid-2016 to the FDA requesting a change to the prescribing information for Veltassa. We cannot predict whether any such sNDA will result in a change to the prescribing information for Veltassa. We also cannot predict the commercial impact our Phase 1 DDI studies or a change in the prescribing information, if any, will have on Veltassa.\nThe prescribing information for Veltassa also includes a limitation of use that Veltassa should not be used as an emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia because of its delayed onset of action. The prescribing information also includes the following warnings and precautions: a section regarding worsening gastrointestinal motility with an instruction to avoid using Veltassa in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction or impaction, including abnormal post-operative bowel motility disorders, because Veltassa may be ineffective and may worsen gastrointestinal conditions, and a section regarding hypomagnesemia indicating Veltassa binds to magnesium in the colon, which can lead to hypomagnesemia, with an instruction to monitor serum magnesium, or magnesium in the blood.\nThe boxed warning, dosing separation, limitation of use and other warnings and precautions may adversely affect the commercial success of Veltassa and our business, and may materially harm our results of operations.\nWe have recently built our commercial capabilities. If we are unable to optimize these capabilities on our own, and through our collaborators, we will not be able to successfully commercialize Veltassa, or any future product candidates, or generate product revenue.\nWe have recently built our commercial capabilities, and we have only limited experience commercializing a pharmaceutical product. Our ability to optimize our commercial, medical affairs, marketing, sales, market access, managerial and other non-technical capabilities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincentivize and retain our commercial and medical affairs personnel, including our sales force;\n\u00b7\nensure our sales representatives, who have limited experience with our company or Veltassa, deliver clear and compelling messages regarding Veltassa, and are credible and persuasive in educating physicians on the appropriate situations to consider prescribing it;\n\u00b7\nensure our commercial customer-facing team, including sales, market access, and field logistics professionals, effectively build relationships with their respective customers;\n\u00b7\nensure our commercial customer-facing team complies with all laws and regulations, including laws regarding off-label promotion;\n\u00b7\nensure our patient support personnel comply with all laws and regulations, including laws regarding healthcare compliance;\n\u00b7\nmanage a geographically dispersed national commercial customer-facing team; and\n\u00b7\nmanage our significant growth and the integration of new personnel.\nOptimizing our commercial capabilities, including our sales capabilities, may be more expensive and time consuming than we anticipate, requiring us to divert resources from other intended purposes. Any failure or delay in optimizing these capabilities may adversely impact the successful commercialization of Veltassa or any future product candidate. In addition, our initial sales force may be materially less than the actual number of sales representatives required to successfully commercialize Veltassa. As such, we may be required to hire substantially more sales representatives than expected to adequately support the commercialization of Veltassa.\nWe also rely on the commercial capabilities of our collaborators, Sanofi Aventis U.S. LLC, or Sanofi, and VFMCRP. In August 2015, we entered into a Detailing Agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which Sanofi\u2019s nephrology sales force is complementing our commercialization efforts in the United States, and we entered into a License Agreement with VFMCRP pursuant to which VFMCRP will develop and commercialize Veltassa outside the United States and Japan.\nOur arrangements with Sanofi and VFMCRP, or any other third-party collaborators, may result in lower product revenue than if we directly sold and distributed Veltassa, and some or all of the product revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and these efforts may not be successful. In addition, our arrangement with VFMCRP may divert resources from our efforts to market Veltassa in the United States. We may also choose to collaborate with additional third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems to further augment our own, and our collaborators\u2019, sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Veltassa.\nIf we are unable to optimize our commercial capabilities, on our own and through our collaborators, we may be unable to successfully commercialize Veltassa or any future product candidate, and our revenue will suffer and we will incur significant additional losses.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of payer formulary access and/or reimbursement for Veltassa, or any future products, sales would be adversely affected.\nThere will be no commercially viable market for Veltassa without formulary access and reimbursement from third-party government and commercial payers. Formulary access is being placed on a payer\u2019s list of covered drugs for reimbursement. In addition, even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of access and/or reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nObtaining formulary approval can be an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval for Veltassa or any future products into our target markets. Even if we do obtain formulary approval, third-party payers, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. We may engage in contracting with some or all payers and certain contracts require us to provide discounts or rebates to achieve our contracting goals, including appropriate formulary placement, and such discounts or rebates may adversely impact our ability to achieve profitability.\nIn addition, a current trend in the U.S. health care industry is toward cost containment. Large government and commercial payers and pharmacy benefits managers are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of and access to particular treatments. Such third-party payers are questioning the coverage of, and challenging the prices charged for medical products, and many third-party payers limit coverage of, or reimbursement for, newly approved health care products. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for Veltassa or any future product, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated.\nIf the price for Veltassa, or any future products, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer. In addition, reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis.\nVeltassa may face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\nThe pharmaceutical market is highly competitive and dynamic, and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Veltassa has been approved for the treatment of hyperkalemia. While current options for the chronic management of hyperkalemia are limited, we compete against well-known treatment options, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate (e.g., Kayexalate\u00ae). In addition, there are potential new treatment options for hyperkalemia. In December 2015, AstraZeneca PLC completed its purchase of ZS Pharma, Inc., or ZS Pharma, and is developing a zirconium silicate particle to treat hyperkalemia referred to as sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, or ZS-9. The New Drug Application, or NDA, for ZS-9 was submitted to the FDA in May 2015, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for a decision by the FDA is May 26, 2016. The MAA for ZS-9 was submitted to the EMA in December 2015. Ardelyx, Inc. has announced that it is developing two treatments for hyperkalemia: a potassium-binding polymer based on polystyrene sulfonate and a potential drug to enhance potassium secretion. In order to compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia with Veltassa is a worthwhile alternative to existing or new therapies for hyperkalemia.\nWe face significant competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address these markets. Many of our competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in nonclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.\nFailure to effectively compete against established treatment options for hyperkalemia or in the future with new products currently in development would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited operating history, have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have only one approved drug and limited commercial sales, which, together with our limited operating history, make it difficult to assess our future viability.\nPharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused principally on developing and commercializing Veltassa, which is our only approved drug. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in August 2007. We have only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. To date, we have generated only limited revenue from product sales. We continue to incur significant operating expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $178.7 million, $79.9 million and $73.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $484.4 million. We may continue to incur substantial operating losses even if we generate meaningful revenues from the sales of Veltassa. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to the nonclinical and clinical development of Veltassa. As of December 31, 2015, we had working capital of approximately $187.1 million and capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $240.7 million. Subsequently, we commenced an at-the market offering pursuant to which we have received additional net proceeds of $44.2 million in January and February 2016. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future as we continue development and commercialization of Veltassa and develop any other product candidates we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and supply and sales and marketing. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. As of December 31, 2015, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments plus at-the-market offering proceeds of $44.2 million and anticipated 2016 revenues will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully and timely commercialize Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost of post-marketing studies for Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for Veltassa outside the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of obtaining commercial supplies of Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing, selling and marketing costs associated with Veltassa, including the cost and timing of expanding our commercial capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of sales and other revenues from Veltassa, including the sales price and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement;\n\u00b7\nthe cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner for potential future clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate:\n\u00b7\ncommercialization activities for Veltassa or any future product candidate, such as building and optimizing our commercial capabilities;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials or other development activities for Veltassa or any future product candidate; or\n\u00b7\nour research and development activities.\nVeltassa has not yet been approved for marketing by any foreign regulatory authority and may never receive approval by foreign regulatory authorities, which would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.\nUnder our License Agreement with VFMCRP, we are relying on VFMCRP to develop and commercialize Veltassa outside of the United States and Japan, and we and VFMCRP plan to submit our MAA to the EMA in the first half of 2016. To gain approval to market Veltassa in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions, we and our collaborators must provide the foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that adequately demonstrates the safety and efficacy of Veltassa for the intended indication applied for in the respective regulatory filing. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in, or following, clinical trials even after promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical studies. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, and such regulations differ from country to country.\nForeign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval to market Veltassa for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable foreign regulatory authority that Veltassa is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u00b7\nthe applicable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s disagreement with the interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of Veltassa outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u00b7\nthe applicable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s requirement for additional nonclinical or clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nthe applicable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s non-approval of the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nthe applicable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s failure to approve our processes/systems at our corporate facility, or the manufacturing processes or third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or\n\u00b7\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the applicable foreign regulatory authorities to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nVeltassa may not receive foreign marketing approval despite having achieved its specified endpoints in clinical trials and having obtained FDA approval. Foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in evaluating the results of our trials, and may interpret the data from our trials differently than the FDA. Clinical data often is susceptible to varying interpretations and many companies that have believed that their products performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain foreign regulatory approval for their product. Foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials.\nBased on these factors, foreign regulatory authorities may request additional information from us and VFMCRP, including data from additional clinical and/or non-clinical trials, which could be time consuming and expensive and, ultimately, may not grant marketing approval for Veltassa. In addition, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials under our License Agreement with VFMCRP in order to obtain approval to market in foreign jurisdictions, and such clinical trials may not generate the data needed for approval, may be expensive to conduct, may cause delay, and may divert resources from our efforts to market Veltassa in the United States and otherwise operate our business.\nAny delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, foreign regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of Veltassa in foreign jurisdictions and would have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects.\nWe rely completely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our clinical drug supply of Veltassa, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supply of Veltassa and nonclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidate.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or internal capability to produce our commercial supply of Veltassa and we lack the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any product candidates on a nonclinical, clinical or commercial scale. The FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities must approve our contract manufacturers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product for Veltassa, or any future product candidates.\nWe do not directly control the manufacturing of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with the cGMP for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Furthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory clearance of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facility. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of Veltassa, or any future product candidates, or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market Veltassa, or any future product candidates, if approved.\nWe and our third-party suppliers continue to refine and improve the manufacturing process, certain aspects of which are complex and unique, and we may encounter difficulties with new or existing processes, particularly as we seek to significantly increase our capacity to commercialize Veltassa. For example, we have analyzed the impurities identified in the manufactured registration batches of Veltassa and we believe the levels of impurities, including the levels of genotoxic and special toxicological concern impurities, are below the suggested guidance recommendations; however, toxicological assessments might change based on our future findings. Our reliance on contract manufacturers also exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may appropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nOur current drug substance is acquired from only two suppliers and our finished drug product is acquired from a single-source supplier. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us with the drug substance or the finished drug product, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe currently operate under a multi-year Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Lanxess Corporation, or Lanxess, and a multi-year Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with DPx Fine Chemicals Austria GmbH & Co KG, or DPx Fine Chemicals, formerly DSM Fine Chemicals Austria NFG GMBH & Co. KG, for the manufacture and supply of drug substance. However, we do not currently have additional suppliers of drug substance under contract, and we submitted only Lanxess as a drug substance supplier for Veltassa. Lanxess is our only approved commercial manufacturer. We currently plan to submit a supplemental NDA, or sNDA, in the first half of 2016 for DPx Fine Chemicals to be approved as a supplier of drug substance. In addition, we currently operate under a multi-year Supply Agreement with Patheon Inc., or Patheon, for the manufacture and supply of finished drug product. However, we do not have an alternative supplier of finished drug product under contract, and only Patheon has been validated as a finished drug product supplier for Veltassa. Lanxess and Patheon are currently manufacturing our commercial supply of Veltassa.\nAlthough we have entered into long-term commercial supply agreements with Lanxess, DPx Fine Chemicals and Patheon, we may be unable do so with alternative suppliers and manufacturers or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse impact upon our business.\nIn addition, we currently rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce Veltassa, including all of the starting/raw materials and excipient, such as methyl-2-fluoro-acrylate monomer, or MFA. We do not have direct control over the acquisition of those materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, outside of our drug substance suppliers, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of those materials.\nWe are dependent on the approval of additional drug substance and drug product suppliers to ensure sufficient supply to meet our anticipated market demand and to reduce the manufacturing cost of Veltassa. Our inability to obtain approval for additional suppliers and/or the inability of our suppliers to achieve larger scale production, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nPolymeric-based drugs like Veltassa generally require large quantities of drug substance, as compared to small molecule drugs. Thus, we will require larger scale and/or multiple suppliers of drug substance and drug product in order to produce sufficient quantities of Veltassa to meet our anticipated market demand. Our current suppliers of drug substance, Lanxess and DPx Fine Chemicals, do not currently have the capacity to manufacture Veltassa in the quantities that we believe will be sufficient to meet anticipated market demand. Our business plan assumes that we are able to develop a supply chain with multiple suppliers and significantly decrease our cost of goods within the first several years of commercialization of Veltassa, enabling us to achieve gross margins similar to those achieved by other companies that produce non-absorbed polymeric drugs. If we are unable to reduce the manufacturing cost of Veltassa, our operating results will suffer and our ability to achieve profitability will be significantly jeopardized.\nBecause we submitted our NDA with single source suppliers for drug substance and drug product, we will need to obtain approval from the FDA for these additional suppliers, including approval for the testing necessary to prove equivalence of drug substance and product produced by the additional suppliers. Further, we are dependent on our drug substance and product suppliers to be able to fully scale up the production of Veltassa as well as validate certain process improvements in order to reach the quantities we anticipate needing.\nWe are also dependent upon the appropriate sourcing of starting/raw material, including large quantities, measured in metric tons, of MFA. While we believe there are multiple alternative suppliers of MFA, we will need our drug substance suppliers to qualify these alternate MFA suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the starting materials necessary to produce Veltassa. If our drug substance manufacturer is unable to source, or we are unable to purchase, MFA on acceptable terms, of sufficient quality, and in adequate quantities, if at all, the ability of Veltassa to reach its market potential, or any future product candidates to be launched, would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of Veltassa or any future product candidates.\nIf there is a disruption to our contract manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 relevant operations, we will have no other means of producing Veltassa until they restore the affected facilities or we or they procure alternative manufacturing facilities. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our contract manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture Veltassa on a timely basis.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective distribution process utilizing cold-chain logistics for Veltassa, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse Veltassa and distribute it to pharmacies and specialty distributors who will supply Veltassa to the market. We require that Veltassa be maintained at a controlled refrigerated temperature throughout the distribution chain. This distribution chain requires significant coordination among our manufacturing, supply-chain and finance teams, as well as commercial departments, including market access, sales, and marketing. In addition, failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, sales of Veltassa may be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, the use of cold-chain logistics and a distribution network for Veltassa involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that distributors or pharmacies may:\n\u00b7\nnot effectively manage inventory creating delays in product fulfillment to patients or hospitals and/or inventory loss;\n\u00b7\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using Veltassa, or any product related complaints;\n\u00b7\nnot effectively sell or support Veltassa with sufficient cold storage or accordance with class of trade rules;\n\u00b7\nreduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell Veltassa in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u00b7\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u00b7\ncease operations.\nVeltassa has a limited room temperature shelf life, and if we do not effectively maintain our cold-chain supply logistics, then we may experience an unusual number of product returns or out of date product. Any such failure may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our business.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of nonclinical and clinical studies of Veltassa, and any future product candidates, may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in clinical studies for Veltassa do not ensure that future clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. As part of our NDA for Veltassa, we requested deferral for submission of pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults. We expect to begin our first pediatric studies in late 2016.\nWe plan to conduct additional clinical trials of Veltassa, and plan to support investigator sponsored trials, or ISTs, and such trials may not meet their pre-specified endpoints, may generate data that are not consistent with the current label for Veltassa, may generate new or unexpected adverse events and may require us to submit amendments to our label to the FDA. We do not know whether future clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory approval to commence a trial, if applicable;\n\u00b7\nreach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u00b7\nrecruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\nhave patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nensure that clinical sites observe trial protocol or continue to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\naddress any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u00b7\naddress any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u00b7\ninitiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u00b7\nmanufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we have historically done, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of physicians or enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocols as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of Veltassa, or any future product candidates, the commercial prospects of Veltassa, or any future product candidates, may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from Veltassa, or any future product candidates, will be delayed. If any clinical trial of Veltassa generates data that are not consistent with the current prescribing information and medication guide for the product, or generates additional safety, efficacy, tolerability or convenience concerns for the product, our ability to generate product revenue from Veltassa may be harmed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some of our nonclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to successfully commercialize Veltassa and unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any future product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials and, in some cases, nonclinical studies. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, collaborative partners and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct our clinical trials. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct some of our nonclinical studies and all of our clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, including some regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or cGCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials.\nIn addition, the execution of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. Moreover, these third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. These third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon as little as 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. Some of these agreements may also be terminated by such third parties under certain other circumstances, including our insolvency. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Veltassa or to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nOur clinical drug development program may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take Veltassa may experience. The number of subjects exposed to Veltassa treatment and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events, or chance findings, that may only be detected after Veltassa is administered to more patients and for greater periods of time.\nClinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. However, with a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, we cannot be fully assured that other adverse events or reactions with Veltassa, such as rare and severe side effects, may not be uncovered after a significantly larger number of patients are exposed to the drug. Further, we have not designed our clinical trials to determine the effect and safety consequences on total body potassium levels of lowering serum potassium over a multi-year period.\nIn our clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 2% of patients treated) were constipation, hypomagnesemia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and flatulence. Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate. Constipation generally resolved during the course of treatment. Mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.3% of patients treated. Reactions have also included edema of the lips.\nAlthough we have monitored the subjects in our studies for certain safety concerns and we have not seen evidence of significant safety concerns in our clinical trials, it is possible that there may be unforeseen safety findings with increased patient exposure to Veltassa. While most adverse reactions were mild to moderate these may occur in a more severe form while taking Veltassa. For example, in our clinical trials, we have seen some reductions in blood pressure, which may lead to hypotension, and some reductions in serum magnesium, which in severe forms may lead to weakness, muscle cramps, cardiac arrhythmia, increased irritability of the nervous system with tremors and jerking, confusion or seizures. Further, a degradant of Veltassa is calcium fluoride, which may lead to increased levels of fluoride resulting in bone fragility, tooth decays or nephrotoxicity. Although none of the symptoms associated with severe hypomagnesemia or acute fluoride toxicity have been reported in our clinical studies, patients may experience these more severe side effects while taking Veltassa.\nIf safety problems occur or are identified after Veltassa reaches the market, the FDA may require that we amend the labeling of Veltassa, recall Veltassa, or even withdraw approval for Veltassa.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of Veltassa or any future product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk with the commercialization of Veltassa, or any future product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for Veltassa or any future product candidates;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\na diversion of management\u2019s time and resources;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigations, product recalls or withdrawals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize Veltassa or any future product candidates.\nOur inability to maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Veltassa or any future products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering use in our clinical trials in the amount of $10.0 million for each occurrence and $10.0 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nWe will need to manage the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing our recent growth.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 406 full-time employees, which includes 291 employees who joined in 2015. We will need to manage the significant and rapid growth of our organization, including a geographically dispersed national customer-facing team, and the integration and retention of new personnel. If we are unable to manage our significant growth and retain our new personnel, then our business may be materially harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management, we may be unable to successfully develop Veltassa or any future product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize Veltassa or any future product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent upon our experienced senior management. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of Veltassa or any future product candidates. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our senior management team, these agreements do not provide for a fixed term of service.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. In addition, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses. We have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach; however, such measures cannot provide absolute security, and we have taken, and will take, additional security measures to protect against any future intrusion. Any failure to protect against breakdowns, malicious intrusions and computer viruses may result in the impairment of production and key business processes. In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees or others, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. Such disruptions and breaches of security could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our business.\nOur loan and security agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur loan and security agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions without our lenders\u2019 prior consent. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nsell, transfer, lease or dispose of our assets;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur or assume additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nencumber or permit liens on certain of our assets;\n\u00b7\nmake restricted payments, including paying dividends on, repurchasing or making distributions with respect to our common stock;\n\u00b7\nmake specified investments (including loans and advances);\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nThe covenants in our loan and security agreements may limit our ability to take certain actions and, in the event that we breach one or more covenants, our lenders may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts outstanding, plus penalties and interest, terminate their commitments to extend further credit and foreclose on the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Such repayment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. We may fail to comply with the rules that apply to public companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could result in sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel must devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we maintain compliance with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. Any changes we have made, and may make in the future, to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, and the related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nDuring the course of our review and testing, we may identify deficiencies and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. Furthermore, if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, as a public company we are required to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The NASDAQ Global Select Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nIn addition, we implemented an enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system for our company. The ERP system is intended to combine and streamline the management of our financial, accounting, human resources, sales and marketing and other functions, enabling us to manage operations and track performance more effectively. However, the ERP system requires us to complete many processes and procedures for the effective use of the system or to run our business using the system, which may result in substantial costs. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using the ERP system could adversely affect our controls and harm our business, including our ability to accurately report financial results on a timely basis, forecast or make sales and collect our receivables. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring or commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing and commercialization of Veltassa, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize a portfolio of products utilizing proprietary discovery and development technology. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and/or by selectively pursuing commercially synergistic in-licensing or acquisition of additional compounds. All of our other potential product candidates remain in the discovery stage. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u00b7\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payers, if applicable.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing Veltassa.\nOur current collaboration arrangements, and any collaboration arrangement that we may enter into in the future, may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize Veltassa and potential future product candidates.\nOur collaboration arrangements with VFMCRP and Sanofi, and any collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future, may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. In addition, disagreements between us and our collaborators may lead to delays in the development process or commercialization and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve, particularly if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority. Our collaboration arrangements also may be terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business or reputation.\nIn addition, we may also seek additional collaboration arrangements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of Veltassa and for potential future product candidates. We may enter into these arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, both in the United States and internationally. We will face, to the extent that we decide to enter into additional collaboration arrangements, significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement any additional collaboration arrangements should we choose to do so, and the terms we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nIf we engage in acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nAlthough we currently have no intent to do so, we may attempt to acquire businesses, technologies, services, products or product candidates that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. If we do undertake any acquisitions, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, products or product candidates into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from our core business. In addition, we may fail to retain key executives and employees of the companies we may acquire, which may reduce the value of the acquisition or give rise to additional integration costs. Future acquisitions could result in additional issuances of equity securities that would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. Future acquisitions could also result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or the amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize Veltassa outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have entered into the License Agreement with VFMCRP to commercialize Veltassa outside of the United States and Japan if the product receives the applicable approvals for commercialization, and we may enter into additional agreements with third parties to commercialize Veltassa in Japan. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into these international business relationships, including:\n\u00b7\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifferent reimbursement systems, and different competitive drugs indicated to treat hyperkalemia;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u00b7\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product and product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters and other facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which in the past has experienced severe earthquakes. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations for Veltassa, and any future products, and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, Veltassa, and any future product, may be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal, and we may be required to manage additional time and resource-intensive operational challenges and be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems, including emerging safety issues, with our products.\nEven if a drug is FDA-approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. For example, as part of our FDA approval for Veltassa, we have a post-marketing commitment to conduct pediatric studies. Furthermore, the existing FDA regulations and any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays or increased costs to assure compliance. Veltassa will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have FDA approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u00b7\nissue warning letters;\n\u00b7\nimpose additional post-marketing safety requirements or restrictions;\n\u00b7\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspend regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u00b7\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u00b7\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our commercialization of, and revenues from, Veltassa. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate meaningful revenues from the sale of Veltassa our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nCurrently, Veltassa is approved solely for the treatment of hyperkalemia and, unless we seek regulatory approval for additional indications, we will be prohibited from marketing Veltassa for any other indication.\nCurrently, Veltassa is approved solely for the treatment of hyperkalemia. We do not have plans to seek approval of Veltassa for any other indication at this time. Even though we obtained regulatory approval to market Veltassa with an indication statement for the treatment of hyperkalemia, we are prohibited from marketing Veltassa using any promotional claims relating to maintaining more patients on, or enabling the increased or optimized usage of, RAAS inhibitors. The exploratory endpoints analyzing the modification of RAAS inhibitor medication due to recurrent hyperkalemia in our pivotal Phase 3 trial were not sufficient to support FDA approval of a RAAS inhibitor enabling indication. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. While Veltassa has been studied in the setting of hyperkalemia associated with the use of RAAS inhibitors, Veltassa may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in its approved labeling. Under applicable regulations, the ability of a company to make marketing statements about the effectiveness of its drug outside of the statements made in the label, referred to as \u201coff-label\u201d marketing, is prohibited. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability.\nIf we fail to comply, or are found to have failed to comply, with FDA and other regulations related to the promotion of Veltassa for unapproved uses, we could be subject to criminal penalties, substantial fines or other sanctions and damage awards.\nThe regulations relating to the promotion of products before approval or for unapproved uses are complex and subject to substantial interpretation by the FDA and other government agencies. We were not permitted to promote Veltassa before we received marketing approval from the FDA. And even though we have received marketing approval, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. We have implemented compliance and training programs designed to ensure that our sales and marketing practices comply with applicable regulations. Notwithstanding these programs, the FDA or other government agencies may allege or find that our practices constitute prohibited promotion of Veltassa for unapproved uses. We also cannot be sure that our employees complied with company policies and applicable regulations regarding the promotion of products before approval or will comply with such policies and regulations regarding unapproved uses. Over the past several years, a significant number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including the Department of Justice and various U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have alleged violations of various federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products before approval or for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. Many of these investigations originate as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions under the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, any individual can bring a claim on behalf of the government alleging that a person or entity has presented a false claim, or caused a false claim to be submitted, to the government for payment. The person bringing a qui tam suit is entitled to a share of any recovery or settlement. Qui tam suits, also commonly referred to as \u201cwhistleblower suits,\u201d are often brought by current or former employees. In a qui tam suit, the government must decide whether to intervene and prosecute the case. If it declines, the individual may pursue the case alone.\nIf the FDA or any other governmental agency initiates an enforcement action against us or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such fines, awards or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects and reputation.\nWe are required to report to regulatory authorities adverse events that may occur during the use of Veltassa or any future product, and if we fail to do so we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nFDA and foreign regulatory authority regulations require that we report certain information about adverse events whether or not Veltassa, or any future product, may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may receive adverse event reports in potentially large numbers from a variety of sources, including from physicians, other healthcare providers and patients as well as from clinical trials, patient support programs, scientific literature and media. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the required timeframe.\nWe may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of reportable safety information, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency could take action, including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nIf third-party manufacturers fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBefore they can begin commercial manufacture of Veltassa, contract manufacturers must obtain regulatory approval of their manufacturing facilities, processes and quality systems. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner.\nIf a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nIf we want to expand the geographies in which we may market Veltassa, we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals.\nWe are relying on VFMCRP to develop and commercialize Veltassa outside of the United States and Japan, and we and VFMCRP plan to submit our MAA in the first half of 2016. In order to obtain a MAA or other regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or studies to support our applications, which would be time consuming and expensive, and may produce results that do not result in regulatory approvals. Further, we will have to expend substantial time and resources in order to manage our collaboration with VFMCRP to promote and commercialize Veltassa outside of the United States and Japan. If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for Veltassa in foreign jurisdictions, our ability to expand our business outside the United States will be severely limited.\nOur failure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions for Veltassa would prevent us from marketing our products internationally.\nIn order to market any product in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, separate regulatory approvals are required. In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a MAA. Before granting the MAA, the EMA, or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nThe approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or to do so on a timely basis, and even if we do file we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe are subject to healthcare, statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate as a commercial organization include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; and\n\u00b7\nU.S. and European reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and adversely impact our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nThe PPACA also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on drug manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. In addition, drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers were required to begin data collection on August 1, 2013 and report such data to the government by March 31, 2014 and by the 90th calendar day of each year thereafter.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nWe may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of any future product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Although we have obtained approval to market Veltassa in the United States, neither we nor any future collaboration partner is permitted to market any future product candidate in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA. Obtaining regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable United States and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other actions, including:\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of regulatory approval of products;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizure or detention;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production; and\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a drug candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. The number of nonclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our drug candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of a drug candidate for any or all targeted indications.\nFDA approval of an NDA or NDA supplement is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process and we may encounter matters with the FDA that require us to expend additional time and resources and delay or prevent the approval of our product candidates. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\na drug candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may not find the data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA might not approve our third party manufacturers\u2019 processes or facilities; or\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf any future product candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely harmed.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any future product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u00b7\nadditional clinical trials to be conducted prior to obtaining approval;\n\u00b7\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u00b7\nrecall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u00b7\nadditional record keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may become subject to claims alleging infringement of third parties\u2019 patents or proprietary rights and/or claims seeking to invalidate our patents, which would be costly, time consuming and, if successfully asserted against us, delay, hinder, or prevent the development and commercialization of Veltassa or any future product candidates.\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings asserting patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We cannot be certain that Veltassa or any future product candidates will not infringe existing or future third-party patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that we may infringe by commercializing Veltassa or future product candidates. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. In addition, Veltassa has a complex structure that makes it difficult to conduct a thorough search and review of all potentially relevant third-party patents. We may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of Veltassa.\nWe may be subject to third-party claims in the future against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents. We may be required to indemnify our current or future collaborators against such claims. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to redesign it, or to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, such litigation can be expensive and time consuming to litigate and would divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology similar or identical to ours, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, to determine which party is entitled to a patent on the disputed invention. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. Since patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates.\nIf our intellectual property related to Veltassa or any future product candidates is not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to Veltassa and our development programs. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, patents granted by the European Patent Office may be opposed by any person within nine months from the publication of the grant. Similar proceedings are available in other jurisdictions, and in some jurisdictions third parties can raise questions of validity with a patent office even before a patent has granted. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. For example, a third party may develop a competitive product that provides therapeutic benefits similar to Veltassa but has a sufficiently different composition to fall outside the scope of our patent protection. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to Veltassa or any future product candidates is successfully challenged, then our ability to commercialize Veltassa or any future product candidates could be negatively affected, and we may face unexpected competition that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market Veltassa or any future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced.\nEven where laws provide protection, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. If we or one of our current or future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering Veltassa or one of our future products, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability against our intellectual property related to Veltassa, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on Veltassa. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. Moreover, our competitors could counterclaim that we infringe their intellectual property, and some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios than we do.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable, processes for which patents may be difficult to obtain and/or enforce and any other elements of our product development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and endeavor to execute confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, nor can we be certain that our agreements will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our IP License and Assignment Agreement, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to an IP License and Assignment Agreement with Ilypsa, Inc., or Ilypsa, which is a subsidiary of Amgen Inc., pursuant to which we license key intellectual property relating to our drug discovery and development technology. Although our obligations under the license are limited, the license agreement does impose certain diligence, notice and other obligations not currently applicable to us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, Ilypsa (Amgen) may have the right to terminate the license, other than in respect of Veltassa.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions to maintain patent applications and issued patents. Noncompliance with these requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe have not yet registered trademarks for Veltassa in many jurisdictions outside the United States and failure to secure such registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have an approved trademark application for Veltassa in the United States, and trademark applications in numerous foreign countries, many of which have been approved and many of which are under examination. Although we will have a registered trademark for Veltassa in the United States, our trademark applications for Veltassa outside the United States may be rejected during trademark registration proceedings. We are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, but we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties can oppose pending trademark applications and seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. And regardless of any application or registration, third parties may object to our use of Veltassa if they were to have legitimate prior conflicting rights. Moreover, any name we propose to use with any product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market Veltassa or any future products. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our technology.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u00b7\nthe successful commercialization of Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of therapeutic innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u00b7\nchanges or developments in laws or regulations applicable to Veltassa;\n\u00b7\nfuture financing transactions;\n\u00b7\nany changes to our relationship with any manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our testing and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our efforts to acquire or license or discover additional product candidates;\n\u00b7\nany intellectual property infringement or interference actions in which we may become involved;\n\u00b7\nannouncements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical industry in general;\n\u00b7\nachievement of expected product sales and profitability;\n\u00b7\nmanufacture, supply or distribution shortages;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nshort selling of our common stock or transacting in derivative securities;\n\u00b7\nsales or purchases of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the United States equity markets; and\n\u00b7\nthe loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business, which could seriously harm our financial position. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, including in future financings or similar arrangements. For example, we filed a shelf registration statement in November 2015 pursuant to which we recently issued shares of our common stock in an at-the-market offering, and we may issue additional shares in the at-the market offering or other registered offerings under the shelf registration statement. If we issue additional shares of our common stock, our stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nIf we do not achieve our publicly disclosed milestones or goals within the expected timing, our stockholders may lose confidence in our ability to achieve future success and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose information related to certain anticipated company milestones or goals and estimated timing for achieving them, including clinical, regulatory, commercial and collaboration milestones or goals. However, we may fail to achieve these milestones or goals, or fail to do so within the expected timing or as projected by the analysts who follow us, and our stockholders and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our ability to achieve future success. As a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 44% of our outstanding voting stock. These stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that certain stockholders may believe are in their best interest.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or short sales of our common stock, could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including after the lapse any legal restrictions on resale, the trading price of our common stock could decline. We have outstanding a total of approximately 42.0 million shares of common stock.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2015, approximately 8.3 million shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options, issuable upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans or subject to outstanding warrants are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock could also decline as result of short sales. Selling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. When an investor sells stock that such investor does not own, it is known as a short sale. The seller, anticipating that the price of the stock will go down, intends to buy stock to cover such seller\u2019s sale at a later date. If the price of the stock goes down, the seller will profit to the extent of the difference between the price at which he or she originally sold it less his or her later purchase price. Short sales enable the seller to profit in a down market. Short sales could place significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could significantly reduce the value of our shares to a potential acquirer or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. The provisions in our charter documents include the following:\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote to remove a director for cause, and the prohibition on removal of directors without cause;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u00b7\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, these provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction. For a description of our capital stock, see the section titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d\nIn addition, certain provisions in our IP License and Assignment Agreement may discourage certain takeover or acquisition attempts, including that in the event we undergo a change of control, we shall pay to Ilypsa (Amgen) an increasing amount of the purchase price, less certain expenses, of such transaction, ranging from approximately 6.7% to 10% of such amount, up to a cap of $30.0 million.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u00b7\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u00b7\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u00b7\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u00b7\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nWe may be required to pay severance benefits to our employees who are terminated in connection with a change in control, which could harm our financial condition or results.\nEach of our executive officers is party to an employment agreement, and each of our other employees is party to an agreement or participates in a plan, that provides change in control severance benefits including cash payments for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock units in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control of us. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial condition and results. The accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock units could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our common stock. In addition, these potential severance benefits may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Additionally, the terms of our loan and security agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, our stockholders are not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders\u2019 ability to receive a return on their investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $387.6 million and $252.4 million for both U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and 2017 for California income tax purposes. If a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the corporation may be subject to annual limits on its ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. An ownership change is, as a general matter, triggered by sales or acquisitions of the corporation\u2019s stock in excess of 50 percentage points on a cumulative basis during a three-year period by persons owning 5% or more of the corporation\u2019s total equity value. We have performed an initial analysis under Section 382 of the Code and believe that we have in the past experienced ownership changes that will result in a limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of this analysis, we have removed the deferred tax assets for net operating losses of $28.6 million generated through December 31, 2014 from our deferred tax asset schedule and have recorded a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance. Our net operating loss carryforwards may also be subject to further limitations in the future as a result of additional ownership changes.", "PERMNO": 14321, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "RLYP"}
