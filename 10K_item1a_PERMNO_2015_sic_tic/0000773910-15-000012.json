Risk Factors\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms \u201cAnadarko\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company has made in this report, and may from time to time make in other public filings, press releases, and management discussions, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, concerning the Company\u2019s operations, economic performance, and financial condition. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and gas properties, marketing and midstream activities, and also include those statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will be realized. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s assumptions about energy markets\n\u2022\nproduction and sales volume levels\n\u2022\nreserves levels\n\u2022\noperating results\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions\n\u2022\ntechnology\n\u2022\navailability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures, and other contractual obligations\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for, the price of, and the commercialization and transporting of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and other products or services\n\u2022\nvolatility in the commodity-futures market\n\u2022\nweather\n\u2022\ninflation\n\u2022\navailability of goods and services, including unexpected changes in costs\n\u2022\ndrilling risks\n\u2022\nprocessing volumes and pipeline throughput\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, either nationally, internationally, or in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its subsidiaries are doing business\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s inability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other governmental approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes, including changes relating to hydraulic fracturing; retroactive royalty or production tax regimes; deepwater drilling and permitting regulations; derivatives reform; changes in state, federal, and foreign income taxes; environmental regulation; environmental risks; and liability under federal, state, foreign, and local environmental laws and regulations\n\u2022\nthe ability of BP Exploration & Production Inc. (BP) to meet its indemnification obligations to the Company for Deepwater Horizon events, including, among other things, damage claims arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), claims for natural resource damages (NRD) and associated damage-assessment costs, and any claims arising under the Operating Agreement (OA) for the Macondo well, as well as the ability of BP Corporation North America Inc. (BPCNA) and BP p.l.c. to satisfy their guarantees of such indemnification obligations\n\u2022\nthe impact of remaining claims related to the Deepwater Horizon events, including, but not limited to, fines, penalties, and punitive damages against the Company, for which it is not indemnified by BP\n\u2022\ncivil or political unrest or acts of terrorism in a region or country\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness and performance of the Company\u2019s counterparties, including financial institutions, operating partners, and other parties\n\u2022\nvolatility in the securities, capital, or credit markets and related risks such as general credit, liquidity, and interest-rate risk\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to successfully monetize select assets, repay its debt, and the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s credit ratings\n\u2022\ndisruptions in international oil, NGLs, and condensate cargo shipping activities\n\u2022\nphysical, digital, internal, and external security breaches\n\u2022\nsupply and demand, technological, political, governmental, and commercial conditions associated with long-term development and production projects in domestic and international locations\n\u2022\nother factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and in the Company\u2019s other public filings, press releases, and discussions with Company management\nRISK FACTORS\nWe may be subject to claims and liabilities relating to the Deepwater Horizon events that are not covered by BP\u2019s indemnification obligations under our Settlement Agreement with BP, or that result in losses to the Company, notwithstanding BP\u2019s indemnification against such losses, as a result of BP\u2019s inability to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement and BPCNA\u2019s and BP p.l.c.\u2019s inability to satisfy their guarantees of BP\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nIn October 2011, the Company and BP entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under OPA, NRD claims and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the OA. This indemnification is guaranteed by BPCNA and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-on amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor.\nAny failure or inability on the part of BP to satisfy its indemnification obligations under the Settlement Agreement, or on the part of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. to satisfy their respective guarantee obligations, could subject us to significant monetary liability beyond the terms of the Settlement Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In November 2012, BP settled all criminal and securities claims brought by the United States against BP, with BP agreeing to pay $4.0 billion over five years to the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the criminal claims and further agreeing to pay another $525 million over three years to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with respect to the securities claims. In addition, in September 2014, the U.S. District Court in New Orleans, Louisiana (Louisiana District Court) issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in the first phase of the Deepwater Horizon trial. The Louisiana District Court found that BP is liable under general maritime law for the blowout, explosion, and oil spill and apportioned 67% of the fault to BP. BP is challenging certain of the Louisiana District Court\u2019s findings.\nFurthermore, in certain instances we may be required to recognize a liability for amounts for which we are indemnified in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. Any such liability recognition without collection of the offsetting receivable could adversely impact our results of operations, our financial condition, and our ability to make borrowings.\nUnder the Settlement Agreement, BP does not indemnify the Company against penalties and fines, punitive damages, shareholder derivative or securities laws claims, or certain other claims. The adverse resolution of any current or future proceeding related to the Deepwater Horizon events for which we are not indemnified by BP could subject us to significant monetary liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in the price of these commodities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. For example, daily settlement prices for New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate oil ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $53.27 per barrel during 2014. Daily settlement prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $6.15 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) to a low of $2.89 per MMBtu during 2014. Our revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital budget, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n\u2022\nvolatile trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets\n\u2022\ncost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural-gas inventories\n\u2022\nweather conditions\n\u2022\npotential U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, oil, condensate, or NGLs\n\u2022\nability of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels\n\u2022\nworldwide military and political environment, civil and political unrest in Africa and the Middle East, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere\n\u2022\neffect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative and competing fuels\n\u2022\nprice and level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxes\n\u2022\nproximity to, and capacity of, natural-gas pipelines and other transportation facilities\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions worldwide\nThe long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, and results of operations\n\u2022\nreducing the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically\n\u2022\ncausing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects\n\u2022\nreducing our revenues, operating income, or cash flows\n\u2022\nreducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves\n\u2022\nreducing the carrying value of our oil and natural-gas properties\n\u2022\nreducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves\n\u2022\nlimiting our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt\nOur domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.\nOur domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, hydraulic fracturing, and environmental protection regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from various federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. Our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including environmental and tax laws and regulations, are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. For example, from time to time, legislation has been proposed that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows related to the following:\n\u2022\nOzone Standards. In December 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published proposed regulations to revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone, recommending a standard between 65 to 70 parts per billion (ppb) for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards protective of public health and public welfare. The current primary and secondary ozone standards are set at 75 ppb. The EPA is also taking comments on whether a 60 ppb standard should be established for the primary standard or whether the existing 75 ppb standard should be retained. If adopted, compliance with such regulations may require the Company to install new equipment to further control emissions and may also cause permitting delays. The EPA currently expects to issue a final rule by October 1, 2015.\n\u2022\nReduction of Methane Emissions. In January 2015, the Obama Administration announced that the EPA is expected to propose in the summer of 2015 and finalize in 2016 new regulations that will regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The Obama Administration seeks to reduce methane emissions from new and modified infrastructure and equipment in the oil and gas sector, including the drilling of new wells, by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025.\n\u2022\nClimate Change. A number of state and regional efforts exist that are aimed at tracking or reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources. We may be required to install \u201cbest available control technology\u201d to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants.\n\u2022\nDeficit Reduction or Tax Reform. Congress may undertake significant deficit reduction or comprehensive tax reform in the coming year. Proposals include provisions that would, if enacted, (i) eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) eliminate the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas qualified production activities, and (iii) eliminate accelerated depreciation for tangible property.\nChanges in laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing or other oil and gas operations could increase our costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil from dense subsurface rock formations such as shales. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nHydraulic fracturing is regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has issued final Clean Air Act regulations governing performance standards for the oil and gas industry; announced its intent to propose in early 2015 effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, in May 2013, the Bureau of Land Management issued a revised proposed rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the agency is expected to promulgate a final rule in early 2015. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that a new, federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic-fracturing process is adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.\nCertain states in which we operate, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, or well-construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or prohibit these operations completely. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, in exchange for the withdrawal of several initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations proposed for inclusion on the Colorado state ballot in November 2014, the governor of Colorado created the Task Force on State and Local Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations (Task Force) in September 2014 to make recommendations to the state legislature regarding the responsible development of Colorado\u2019s oil and gas resources. Although it is early in the process, it is possible that, as a result of the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, Colorado could adopt new policies or legislation relating to oil and natural-gas operations, including measures that would give local governments in Colorado greater authority to limit hydraulic fracturing and other oil and natural-gas operations or require greater distances between well sites and occupied structures. In the event state or local restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, such as the Wattenberg field in Colorado, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or we may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Such costs, delays, restrictions, or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIn addition to asserting regulatory authority, a number of federal entities are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order that established a working group for the purpose of coordinating policy, information sharing, and planning among federal agencies and offices regarding \u201cunconventional natural-gas production,\u201d including hydraulic fracturing. In December 2012, the EPA issued an initial progress report on a study begun in 2011 of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with a draft final report expected to be issued for peer review and comment in early 2015. These studies and initiatives, or any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nOur debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nOur total debt was $15.1 billion at December 31, 2014. We also have various commitments for leases, drilling contracts, derivative contracts, firm transportation, and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments\nAdditionally, the credit agreements governing our $3.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility contain a number of customary covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%, and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to meet such covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our long-term debt was rated \u201cBBB\u201d with a stable outlook by Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P), \u201cBBB-\u201d with a positive outlook by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and \u201cBaa3\u201d with a positive outlook by Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody\u2019s). In February 2015, Moody\u2019s raised our long-term debt rating to \u201cBaa2\u201d and changed the outlook to stable. Although we are not aware of any current plans of S&P, Fitch, or Moody\u2019s to lower their respective ratings on our debt, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital or our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. If our credit ratings were downgraded, it could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of that new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. In addition, a downgrade could affect the Company\u2019s requirements to provide financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements and derivative agreements. See Note 11-Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. The reserves information included or incorporated by reference in this report represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no reserves audit was conducted by these consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural-gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause actual results to vary considerably from these estimates. These factors and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas\n\u2022\nassumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future oil and natural-gas prices, future operating costs, and capital expenditures\n\u2022\nestimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costs\nEstimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this report should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves.\nFailure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find, develop, or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nA portion of our leasehold acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in sufficient quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based on various factors: drilling results, oil and natural-gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.\nFuture economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nDuring the last few years, concerns over inflation, potential default on U.S. debt, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. Continued concerns could cause demand for petroleum products to diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs; affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers, and customers to continue operations; and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.\nAs a result of mergers and acquisitions, we had approximately $5.6 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014. Goodwill must be tested at least annually for impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could lead to an impairment of goodwill, such as the Company\u2019s inability to replace the value of its depleting asset base, difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits, or other adverse events, such as lower oil and natural-gas prices, which could reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. An impairment of goodwill could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, provincial, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations govern the following, among other things:\n\u2022\nissuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production, and midstream activities\n\u2022\nprotection of endangered species\n\u2022\namounts and types of emissions and discharges\n\u2022\ngeneration, management, and disposition of waste materials\n\u2022\noffshore oil and gas operations and decommissioning of abandoned facilities\n\u2022\nreclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites\n\u2022\nremediation of contaminated sites\nIn addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations, including the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the development of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Future environmental laws and regulations, such as the restriction against emission of pollutants from previously unregulated activities or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate, such as the sage grouse, may negatively impact our operations. The cost of satisfying these requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 and Note 17-Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe conduct offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Mozambique, Ghana, Brazil, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Liberia, New Zealand, and other countries. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas because we are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following:\n\u2022\nhurricanes and other adverse weather conditions\n\u2022\noilfield service costs and availability\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other laws and regulations\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, such as piracy\n\u2022\nremediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials\n\u2022\nfailure of equipment or facilities\nIn addition, we conduct some of our exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) where operations and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in its shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that we can market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.\nFurther, production of reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally declines more rapidly than from reservoirs in many other producing regions of the world. This results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the Gulf of Mexico during the initial few years of production and, as a result, our reserves replacement needs from new prospects may be greater there than for our operations elsewhere. Also, our revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods.\nAdditional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations, and other restrictions; delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill-response plans; and other related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, each agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these new and more stringent rules and regulations, in addition to uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, and oil spill-response plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Among other adverse impacts, these additional measures could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. If similar material spill events were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations.\nFurther, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lacks the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite the Company\u2019s oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to future events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident.\nThe matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe operate in foreign countries and are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties.\nOur operations outside the United States are based primarily in Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, and New Zealand. As a result, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include the following, among other things:\n\u2022\nloss of revenue, property, and equipment or delays in operations as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest, and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties\n\u2022\ntransparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues\n\u2022\nincreases in taxes and governmental royalties\n\u2022\nunilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities\n\u2022\nredefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies\n\u2022\nforeign-exchange restrictions\n\u2022\ninternational monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business\nFor example, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are engaged in a dispute regarding the international maritime and land boundaries between the two countries. As a result, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire claims to be entitled to the maritime area which covers a portion of the Deepwater Tano Block where we are developing the TEN complex. In the event C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is successful in its maritime border claims, this development could be materially impacted. Also, Venezuela and Guyana are in a dispute regarding their maritime and land borders in which the two countries have initiated a dialogue. We are unable to ascertain the full impact of this border dispute on future operations in Guyana.\nOutbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have occurred in countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including countries where we conduct operations. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations. In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired.\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies, and regulations of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions.\nRealization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk-management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:\n\u2022\nour production is less than the notional volumes\n\u2022\na widening of price basis differentials occurs between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements\n\u2022\na sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil, natural-gas, or NGLs prices\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate, and other risks associated with its business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the proposed margin rules, position limits, and commodity clearing requirements, remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time.\nNew or modified rules, regulations, or legal requirements may increase the cost and impact the availability to our counterparties of their hedging and swap positions that they can make available to us, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation or post margin collateral. Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivative activities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity-price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and (iv) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent the Company transacts with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, it may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nDeterioration in the credit or equity markets could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to different counterparties. For example, we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender\u2019s commitment under our credit facility. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of the Company\u2019s production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.\nWe are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nOur business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and gas, including blowouts; cratering and fire; environmental hazards, such as gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, and releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property; pollution or other environmental damage; and injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/loss of control of a well, comprehensive general liability, aviation liability, and worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMaterial differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects.\nWe are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include the following:\n\u2022\nproject approvals by joint-venture partners\n\u2022\ntimely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies or legislative and other governmental approvals\n\u2022\nweather conditions\n\u2022\navailability of qualified personnel\n\u2022\ncivil and political environment of, and existing infrastructure in, the country or region in which the project is located\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment\n\u2022\ncommercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons\nDelays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to large development projects and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nThe oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies, and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur drilling activities may not be productive.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering\n\u2022\nmarine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes\n\u2022\ndifficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel\n\u2022\ntitle problems\n\u2022\nother adverse weather conditions\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the delivery of equipment\nCertain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to high-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.\nWe have limited influence over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital, lead to unexpected future costs, or adversely affect the timing of activities.\nOur ability to sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation.\nThe marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities and tanker transportation. If any pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the oil and gas.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWhile we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent and regulation of stockholders\u2019 ability to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. The amount of cash dividends, if any, to be paid in the future will depend on actions taken by our Board of Directors, as well as, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, levels of capital and exploration expenditures, future business prospects, expected liquidity needs, and other related matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nThe loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.\nThe successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not carry key man insurance. Our exploratory drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.", "PERMNO": 70332, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "APC"}
