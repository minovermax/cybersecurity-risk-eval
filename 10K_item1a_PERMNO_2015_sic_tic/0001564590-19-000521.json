If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have incurred losses and anticipate continued losses and negative cash flow.\nWe have transitioned from a research and development company to a commercial products manufacturer, services provider and developer. We have not been profitable since our year ended October 31, 1997. We expect to continue to incur net losses and generate negative cash flows until we can produce sufficient revenues and margins to cover our costs. We may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future. For the reasons discussed in more detail below, there are uncertainties associated with our achieving and sustaining profitability. We have, from time to time, sought financing in the public markets in order to fund operations and will continue to do so. Our future ability to obtain such financing could be impaired by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the price of our common stock and general market conditions.\nOur cost reduction strategy may not succeed or may be significantly delayed, which may result in our inability to deliver improved margins.\nOur cost reduction strategy is based on the assumption that increases in production will result in economies of scale. In addition, our cost reduction strategy relies on advancements in our manufacturing process, global competitive sourcing, engineering design, reducing the cost of capital and technology improvements (including stack life and projected power output). Failure to achieve our cost reduction targets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have debt outstanding and may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nOur total consolidated indebtedness was $87.9 million as of October 31, 2018. This includes approximately $46.1 million of debt at our project finance subsidiaries and $41.8 million of debt at the corporate level. The majority of our debt is long-term with $17.6 million due within twelve months as of October 31, 2018. We also had, as of October 31, 2018, approximately $40 million of borrowing capacity under a revolving construction and term project financing facility under which we drew down approximately $5.75 million in December 2018, which must be repaid by the earlier of commercial operation of our 2.8 MW Tulare BioMAT project in California or March 31, 2019. No further draws on this facility are permitted and the facility expires on March 31, 2019. On December 21, 2018, we entered into a $100 million construction loan agreement with Generate Lending, LLC and made an initial draw of $10 million. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring operations, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or dilutive.\nIt is also possible that we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nOur debt agreements contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that entitle the lenders to cause our indebtedness under such debt agreements to become immediately due and payable. In addition, our Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., as amended (the \u201cLoan and Security Agreement\u201d), contains a financial covenant whereby we are required to maintain an unrestricted cash balance in accounts subject to an account control agreement in favor of Hercules Capital, Inc. of 75% of the outstanding loan balance plus the amount of accounts payable not paid within 90 days of the invoice date. In connection with the third amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement in March 2018, we drew a term loan advance of $13.1 million, which resulted in an aggregate amount of outstanding term loan advances of $25.0 million as of October 31, 2018. As of October 31, 2018, the outstanding loan balance under the Loan and Security Agreement was $25.3 million, including accretion of an end-of-term payment.\nOur products compete with products using other energy sources, and if the prices of the alternative sources are lower than energy sources used by our products, sales of our products will be adversely affected.\nOur power plants can operate on a variety of fuels including natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and propane. If these fuels are not readily available or if their prices increase such that electricity produced by our products costs more than electricity provided by other generation sources, our products would be less economically attractive to potential customers. In addition, we have no control over the prices of several types of competitive energy sources such as solar, wind, oil, gas or coal or local utility electricity costs. Significant decreases (or short term increases) in the price of these technologies or fuels or grid delivered prices for electricity could also have a material adverse effect on our business because other generation sources could be more economically attractive to consumers than our products.\nFinancial markets worldwide have experienced heightened volatility and instability, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company, our customers and our suppliers.\nFinancial market volatility can affect the debt, equity and project finance markets. This may impact the amount of financing available to all companies, including companies with substantially greater resources, better credit ratings and more successful operating histories than ours. It is impossible to predict future financial market volatility and instability and the impact on the Company, and it may have a materially adverse effect on us for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u2022\nThe long term nature of our sales cycle can require long lead times between application design, order booking and product fulfillment. For such sales, we often require substantial cash down payments in advance of delivery. Our growth strategy assumes that financing will be available for the Company to finance working capital or for our customers to provide down payments and to pay for our products. Financial market issues may delay, cancel or restrict the construction budgets and funds available to the Company or our customers for the deployment of our products and services.\n\u2022\nProjects using our products are, in part, financed by equity investors interested in tax benefits as well as by the commercial and governmental debt markets. The significant volatility in the U.S. and international stock markets causes significant uncertainty and may result in an increase in the return required by investors in relation to the risk of such projects.\n\u2022\nIf we, our customers or our suppliers cannot obtain financing under favorable terms, our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur contracted projects may not convert to revenue, and our project pipeline may not convert to contracts, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.\nSome of the orders we accept from customers require certain conditions or contingencies (such as permitting, interconnection or financing) to be satisfied, some of which are outside of our control. The time periods from receipt of a contract to installation may vary widely and are determined by a number of factors, including the terms of the customer contract and the customer\u2019s site requirements. These same or similar conditions and contingencies may be required by financiers in order to draw on financing to complete a project. This could have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow and our ability to complete construction of a project.\nWe have signed product sales contracts, engineering, procurement and construction contracts (\u201cEPC\u201d), power purchase agreements (\u201cPPAs\u201d) and long-term service agreements with customers subject to contractual, technology and operating risks as well as market conditions that may affect our operating results.\nWe apply the percentage of completion revenue recognition method to certain product sales contracts which are subject to estimates. On a quarterly basis, we perform a review process to help ensure that total estimated contract costs include estimates of costs to complete that are based on the most recent available information. The percentage of completion for the customer contracts based on this cost analysis is then applied to the total customer contract values to determine the total revenue to be recognized to date.\nIn certain instances, we have executed PPAs with the end-user of the power or site host of the fuel cell power plant. We may then sell the PPA to a project investor or retain the project and collect revenue from the sale of power over the term of the PPA, recognizing electricity revenue as power is generated and sold.\nWe have contracted under long-term service agreements with certain customers to provide service on our products over terms up to 20 years. Under the provisions of these contracts, we provide services to maintain, monitor, and repair customer power plants to meet minimum operating levels. Pricing for service contracts is based upon estimates of future costs including future module replacements. While we have conducted tests to determine the overall life of our products, we have not run certain of our products over their projected useful life prior to large-scale commercialization. As a result, we cannot be sure that our products will last to their expected useful life, which could result in warranty claims, performance penalties, maintenance and module replacement costs in excess of our estimates and losses on service contracts.\nOur ability to proceed with projects under development and complete construction of projects on schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials, tariffs, labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain necessary permits, interconnections or other approvals on acceptable terms or on schedule and by other factors. If any development project or construction is not completed, is delayed or is subject to cost overruns, we could become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become obligated for other damages under contracts, experience diminished returns or write off all or a portion of our investment in the project. Each of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur growing generation portfolio of operating assets exposes us to operational risks and commodity market volatility.\nWe have a growing portfolio of generation assets selling power under PPAs and utility tariff programs that exposes us to operational risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, replacement equipment costs, risks associated with facility start-up operations, failures in the availability or acquisition of fuel, the impact of severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, risks of property damage or injury from energized equipment, availability of adequate water resources and ability to intake and discharge water, use of new or unproven technology, fuel commodity price risk and fluctuating market prices, and lack of alternative available fuel sources.\nWe extend product warranties, which could affect our operating results.\nWe provide for a warranty of our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects. We accrue for warranty costs based on historical warranty claim experience, however, actual future warranty expenses may be greater than we have assumed in our estimates. As a result, operating results could be negatively impacted should there be product manufacturing or performance defects in excess of our estimates.\nOur products are complex and could contain defects and may not operate at expected performance levels which could impact sales and market adoption of our products or result in claims against us.\nWe develop complex and evolving products and we continue to advance the capabilities of our fuel cell stacks and are now producing stacks with a net rated power output of 350 kilowatts and an expected seven year life.\nWe are still gaining field operating experience with respect to our products, and despite experience gained from our growing installed base and testing performed by us, our customers and our suppliers, issues may be found in existing or new products. This could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share or failure to achieve broad market acceptance. The occurrence of defects could also cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs, could divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and could harm our relationships with our customers. The occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business. Defects or performance problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers. From time to time, we have been involved in disputes regarding product warranty issues. Although we seek to limit our liability, a product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming, could be costly to defend, and may hurt our\nreputation in the marketplace. Our customers could also seek and obtain damages from us for their losses. We have accrued liabilities for potential damages related to performance problems, however, actual results may be different than the assumptions used in our accrual calculations.\nWe currently face and will continue to face significant competition.\nWe compete on the basis of our products\u2019 reliability, efficiency, environmental considerations and cost. Technological advances in alternative energy products or improvements in the electric grid or other sources of power generation, or other fuel cell technologies may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products non-competitive or obsolete prior to or after commercialization. Other companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than ours, are currently engaged in the development of products and technologies that are similar to, or may be competitive with, our products and technologies.\nSeveral companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although we are the only domestic company engaged in manufacturing and deployment of stationary carbonate fuel cells. Other emerging fuel cell technologies (and the companies developing them) include small or portable proton-exchange membrane (\u201cPEM\u201d) fuel cells (Ballard Power Systems, Plug Power, and increasing activity by numerous automotive companies including Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and GM), stationary phosphoric acid fuel cells (Doosan), stationary solid oxide fuel cells (Bloom Energy), and small residential solid oxide fuel cells (Ceres Power Holdings and Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd.). Each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in our target markets. There are also other potential fuel cell competitors internationally that could capture market share.\nOther than fuel cell developers, we must also compete with companies that manufacture more mature combustion-based equipment, including various engines and turbines, and have well-established manufacturing, distribution, operating and cost features. Electrical efficiency of these products can be competitive with our SureSource power plants in certain applications. Significant competition may also come from gas turbine companies and large scale solar and wind technologies.\nWe derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes involving substantial costs and risks. Due to this competitive pressure, we may be unable to grow revenue and achieve profitability.\nWe expect a significant portion of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through competitive bidding against other fuel cell technologies and other forms of power generation. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including the significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us and our failure to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win. In addition, following a contract award, we may encounter significant expense, delay or contract modifications as a result of our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained post-award efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. We may not be able to obtain task orders or recognize revenue under these multi-award contracts. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment could adversely affect our revenue and/or profitability.\nUnanticipated increases or decreases in business growth may result in adverse financial consequences for us.\nIf our business grows more quickly than we anticipate, our existing and planned manufacturing facilities may become inadequate and we may need to seek out new or additional space, at considerable cost to us. If our business does not grow as quickly as we expect, our existing and planned manufacturing facilities would, in part, represent excess capacity for which we may not recover the cost. In that circumstance, our revenues may be inadequate to support our committed costs and our planned growth, and our gross margins and business strategy would be adversely affected.\nOur plans are dependent on market acceptance of our products.\nOur plans are dependent upon market acceptance of, as well as enhancements to, our products. Fuel cell systems represent an emerging market, and we cannot be sure that potential customers will accept fuel cells as a replacement for traditional power sources. As is typical in a rapidly evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. Since the distributed generation market is still evolving, it is difficult to predict with certainty the size of the market and its growth rate. The development of a market for our products may be affected by many factors that are out of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe cost competitiveness of our fuel cell products including availability and output expectations and total cost of ownership;\n\u2022\nthe future costs of natural gas and other fuels used by our fuel cell products;\n\u2022\ncustomer reluctance to try a new product;\n\u2022\nthe market for distributed generation and government policies that affect that market;\n\u2022\nlocal permitting and environmental requirements;\n\u2022\ncustomer preference for non-fuel based technologies; and\n\u2022\nthe emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products.\nIf a sufficient market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we will have incurred in the development of our products and may never achieve profitability.\nAs we continue to expand markets for our products, we intend to continue offering power production guarantees and other terms and conditions relating to our products that will be acceptable to the marketplace, and continue to develop a service organization that will aid in servicing our products and obtain self-regulatory certifications, if available, with respect to our products. Failure to achieve any of these objectives may also slow the development of a sufficient market for our products and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of products and for research and development contracts. There can be no assurance that we will continue to achieve the current level of sales of our products to our largest customers. Even though our customer base is expected to increase and our revenue streams to diversify, a substantial portion of net revenues could continue to depend on sales to a limited number of customers. Our agreements with these customers may be canceled if we fail to meet certain product specifications or materially breach the agreements, or if our customers materially breach the agreements, and our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. The loss of, or a reduction in sales to, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent developments with POSCO Energy may limit our efforts to access the South Korean and Asian markets and could expose us to costs of arbitration or litigation proceedings.\nWe have historically relied on POSCO Energy to develop and grow the South Korean and Asian markets for our products and services. We entered into manufacturing and technology transfer agreements with POSCO Energy in 2007, 2009 and 2012, each of which expires on October 31, 2027. The Cell Technology Transfer Agreement (\u201cCTTA\u201d) provides POSCO Energy with the technology rights to manufacture SureSource power plants in South Korea and the right to sell power plants throughout Asia. The CTTA requires POSCO Energy to pay to the Company a 3.0% royalty on POSCO Energy net product sales, as well as a royalty on scheduled fuel cell module replacements under service agreements for modules that were built by POSCO Energy and installed at plants in Asia under the terms of long term service agreements between POSCO Energy and its customers. In March 2017, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with POSCO Energy to permit us to directly develop the Asian fuel cell business, including the right for us to sell SureSource solutions in South Korea and the broader Asian market. In June 2018, POSCO\nEnergy advised us in writing that it was terminating the MOU effective July 15, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, notwithstanding its termination, we will continue to execute on sales commitments in Asia secured in writing prior to July 15, 2018. POSCO Energy has ceased communications with us.\nOn or about November 2, 2018, POSCO Energy served FuelCell Energy with an arbitration demand, initiating a proceeding to resolve various outstanding amounts between the companies. Although the Company has made counterclaims and believes it has valid defenses, we cannot predict the outcome of this or any other proceeding.\nIn light of recent developments with POSCO Energy, FuelCell Energy is evaluating all of its options with respect to its relationship and agreements with POSCO Energy. We cannot predict the outcome of any future discussions with POSCO Energy, if they occur, the future status or scope of our relationship with POSCO Energy, whether our relationship with POSCO Energy will continue in the future, or whether we will become involved in additional mediations, arbitrations, litigation or other proceedings with POSCO Energy, what the costs of any such proceedings will be or the effect of such proceedings on the market. Any such proceedings could result in significant expense to us and adversely affect our business and financial condition and reputation in the market, whether or not such proceedings are resolved in our favor. If our relationship with POSCO Energy ends, or continues on terms that are less favorable to us, or remains unresolved, our efforts to access the South Korean and Asian markets, which are complex markets, may not be successful or may be limited, hindered or delayed.\nIf our goodwill and other intangible assets, long-lived assets, inventory or project assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to operations in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill, in process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d), long-lived assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), inventory, or project assets are impaired. Such a charge might have a significant impact on our reported financial position and results of operations.\nAs required by accounting rules, we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of July 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry. We review IPR&D for impairment on an annual basis as of July 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the fair value is less than the carrying value. If the technology has been determined to be abandoned or not recoverable, we would be required to impair the asset. We review inventory, long-lived assets and project assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be sellable for a profit, or generates positive cash flows, once it is either fully developed or fully constructed. If our projects are not considered commercially viable, we would be required to impair the respective project assets.\nWe have risks associated with high levels of inventory.\nThe amount of total inventory as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 was $53.6 million and $74.5 million, respectively, which includes work in process inventory totaling $29.1 million and $54.4 million, respectively. We previously reduced our production rate and have been operating at a lower level for a period of time in order to deploy inventory to new projects and mitigate future increases in inventory. We recently announced that we are beginning to increase our production rate to prior levels. There is no guarantee, however, that we will be successful in deploying our existing inventory or the new inventory generated by increased production. In addition, there are risks that our inventory could lose some or all of its value due to technological obsolescence, shifts in market demand or other unexpected changes in industry conditions and circumstances. If we are unable to deploy our current inventory or new inventory consistent with our business plan, we may be required to sell it at a loss, abandon it or recycle it into different products. These actions would result in a significant charge to earnings. Such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur advanced technologies contracts are subject to the risk of termination by the contracting party and we may not realize the full amounts allocated under the contracts due to the lack of Congressional appropriations.\nA portion of our fuel cell revenues has been derived from long-term cooperative agreements and other contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy and other U.S. government agencies. These agreements are important to the continued development of our technology and our products. We also contract with private sector companies under certain advanced technologies contracts to develop strategically important and complementary offerings.\nGenerally, our government research and development contracts are subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contracting agency. Furthermore, these contracts, irrespective of the amounts allocated by the contracting agency, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the results of government or agency sponsored reviews and audits of our cost reduction projections and efforts. We can only receive funds under these contracts ultimately made available to us annually by Congress as a result of the appropriations process. Accordingly, we cannot be sure whether we will receive the full amounts awarded under our government research and development or other contracts. Failure to receive the full amounts under any of our government research and development contracts could materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nA negative government audit could result in an adverse adjustment of our revenue and costs and could result in civil and criminal penalties.\nGovernment agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If the agencies determine through these audits or reviews that we improperly allocated costs to specific contracts, they will not reimburse us for these costs. Therefore, an audit could result in adjustments to our revenue and costs.\nFurther, although we have internal controls in place to oversee our government contracts, no assurance can be given that these controls are sufficient to prevent isolated violations of applicable laws, regulations and standards. If the agencies determine that we or one of our subcontractors engaged in improper conduct, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government, any of which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has certain rights relating to our intellectual property, including the right to restrict or take title to certain patents.\nMultiple U.S. patents that we own have resulted from government-funded research and are subject to the risk of exercise of \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights by the government. March-in rights refer to the right of the U.S. government or a government agency to exercise its non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable worldwide license to any technology developed under contracts funded by the government if the contractor fails to continue to develop the technology. These \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights permit the U.S. government to take title to these patents and license the patented technology to third parties if the contractor fails to utilize the patents.\nOur future success and growth is dependent on our market strategy.\nWe cannot assure you that we will enter into business relationships that are consistent with, or sufficient to support, our commercialization plans and our growth strategy or that these relationships will be on terms favorable to us. Even if we enter into these types of relationships, we cannot assure you that the business associates with whom we form relationships will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them. Some of these arrangements have required or will require that we grant exclusive rights to certain companies in defined territories. These exclusive arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the business associate with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to marketing our products. In addition, future arrangements may also include the issuance of equity and/or warrants to purchase our equity, which may have an adverse effect on our stock price and would dilute our existing stockholders. To the extent we enter into partnerships or other business relationships, the failure of these partners or other business associates to assist us with the deployment of our products may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on third party suppliers for the development and supply of key raw materials and components for our products.\nWe use various raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel which are critical to our manufacturing process. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the balance-of-plant components in our products. Suppliers must undergo a qualification process, which takes four to twelve months. We continually evaluate new suppliers, and we are currently qualifying several new suppliers. There are a limited number of suppliers for some of the key components of our products. A supplier\u2019s failure to develop and supply components in a timely manner or to supply components that meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements or our technical specifications, or our inability to obtain alternative sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us could harm our ability to manufacture our SureSource products. In addition, to the extent the processes that our suppliers use to manufacture components are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers.\nWe do not know whether we will be able to maintain long-term supply relationships with our critical suppliers, or secure new long-term supply relationships, or whether such relationships will be on terms that will allow us to achieve our objectives. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we fail to secure long-term relationships with entities that will supply the required components for our SureSource products.\nWe depend on our intellectual property, and our failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success.\nFailure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of our exclusivity or the right to use our technologies. If we do not adequately ensure our freedom to use certain technology, we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement or misappropriation, or be enjoined from using such intellectual property. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we have licensed our carbonate fuel cell manufacturing intellectual property to POSCO Energy, and we depend on POSCO Energy to also protect our intellectual property rights as licensed. As of October 31, 2018, we, excluding our subsidiaries, had 93 U.S. patents and 137 patents in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our SureSource technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology and applications thereof. As of October 31, 2018, we also had 54 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 125 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. Our U.S. patents will expire between 2019 and 2036, and the current average remaining life of our U.S. patents is approximately 9.0 years. Our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Ltd., as of October 31, 2018, had 36 U.S. patents and 76 international patents covering the SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with an average remaining U.S. patent life of approximately 6.3 years. As of October 31, 2018, Versa Power Systems, Ltd. also had three pending U.S. patent applications and 14 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. In addition, as of October 31, 2018, our subsidiary, FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, had license rights to two U.S. patents and seven patents outside the U.S. for carbonate fuel cell technology licensed from Fraunhofer IKTS.\nSome of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application and includes trade secrets and other know-how that is not able to be patented, particularly as it relates to our manufacturing processes and engineering design. In addition, some of our intellectual property includes technologies and processes that may be similar to the patented technologies and processes of third parties. If we are found to be infringing third-party patents, we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use such patents on acceptable terms, if at all. Our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope, and enforceability of a particular patent.\nWe cannot assure you that any of the U.S. or international patents owned by us or other patents that third parties license to us will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, rendered unenforceable or licensed to others, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us, if issued at all. In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or able to be patented, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with our subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, consultants, strategic business associates and employees. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships. Certain of our intellectual property has been licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis from third parties that may also license such intellectual property to others, including our competitors. If our licensors are found to be infringing third-party patents, we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use the intellectual property licensed to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf necessary or desirable, we may seek extensions of existing licenses or further licenses under the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. However, we can give no assurances that we will obtain such extensions or further licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for intellectual property that we use at present could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the use of that intellectual property.\nWhile we are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation, we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing our rights or violating their agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense to us, adversely affecting the development of sales of the challenged product or intellectual property and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not that litigation is resolved in our favor.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, and other personnel.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our executive officers and other key management, engineering, scientific, manufacturing and operating personnel, particularly Arthur Bottone, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of any executive officer, including Mr. Bottone, or other key management, engineering, scientific, manufacturing and operating personnel, could materially adversely affect our business. Our ability to achieve our commercialization plans and to increase production at our manufacturing facility in the future will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, technical, manufacturing and operating personnel. Recruiting personnel for the fuel cell industry is competitive. We do not know whether we will be able to attract or retain additional qualified management, technical, manufacturing and operating personnel. Our inability to attract and retain additional qualified management, technical, manufacturing and operating personnel, or the departure of key employees, could materially and adversely affect our development, commercialization and manufacturing plans and, therefore, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our inability to attract and retain sufficient management, technical, manufacturing and operating personnel to quickly increase production at our manufacturing facility when and if needed to meet increased demand may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities.\nOur management may be unable to manage rapid growth effectively.\nOur fiscal year 2019 plan calls for an increase to our annual production rate. We may further rapidly expand our facilities and manufacturing capabilities, accelerate the commercialization of our products and enter a period of rapid growth, which will place a significant strain on our senior management team and our financial and other resources. Any expansion may expose us to increased competition, greater overhead, marketing and support costs and other risks associated with the commercialization of a new product. We would need to obtain sufficient backlog in order to maintain the use of the expanded capacity. Our ability to manage rapid growth effectively will require us to continue to secure adequate sources of capital and financing, improve our operations, improve our financial and management information systems and train, motivate and manage our employees. Difficulties in effectively managing issues presented by such a rapid expansion could harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be affected by environmental and other governmental regulation.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. In addition, it is possible that industry-specific laws and regulations will be adopted covering matters such as transmission scheduling, distribution, emissions, and the characteristics and quality of our products, including installation and servicing. These regulations could limit the growth in the use of carbonate fuel cell products, decrease the acceptance of fuel cells as a commercial product and increase our costs and, therefore, the price of our products. Accordingly, compliance with existing or future laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nUtility companies may resist the adoption of distributed generation and could impose customer fees or interconnection requirements on our customers that could make our products less desirable.\nInvestor-owned utilities may resist adoption of distributed generation fuel cell plants as such plants are disruptive to the utility business model that primarily utilizes large central generation power plants and associated transmission and distribution. On-site distributed generation that is on the customer-side of the electric meter competes with the utility. Distributed generation on the utility-side of the meter generally has power output that is significantly less than central generation power plants and may be perceived by the utility as too small to materially impact its business, limiting its interest. Additionally, perceived technology risk may limit utility interest in stationary fuel cell power plants.\nUtility companies commonly charge fees to larger, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back up purposes. These fees could increase the cost to our customers of using our SureSource products and could make our products less desirable, thereby harming our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be liable for environmental damages resulting from our research, development or manufacturing operations.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of harmful substances escaping into the environment, resulting in personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, and natural resource damage. Depending on the nature of the claim, our current insurance policies may not adequately reimburse us for costs incurred in settling environmental damage claims, and in some instances, we may not be reimbursed at all. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern environmental protection and human health and safety. We believe that our businesses are operating in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, however, these laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional and more stringent changes in the future.\nOur operations may not comply with future laws and regulations and we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits and private parties may seek damages from us. Under those circumstances, we might be required to curtail or cease operations, conduct site remediation or other corrective action, or pay substantial damage claims.\nOur products use inherently dangerous, flammable fuels, operate at high temperatures and use corrosive carbonate material, each of which could subject our business to product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in products that use hydrogen. Our products utilize fuels such as natural gas and convert these fuels internally to hydrogen that is used by our products to generate electricity. The fuels we use are combustible and may be toxic. In addition, our SureSource products operate at high temperatures and use corrosive carbonate material, which could expose us to potential liability claims. Although we have incorporated a robust design and redundant safety features in our power plants, have established comprehensive safety, maintenance, and training programs, follow third-party certification protocols, codes and standards, and do not store natural gas or hydrogen at our power plants, we cannot guarantee that there will not be accidents. Any accidents involving our products or other hydrogen-using products could materially impede widespread market acceptance and demand for our products. In addition, we might be held responsible for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage. We also cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable terms.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in international operations.\nSince we market our products both inside and outside the U.S., our success depends in part on our ability to secure international customers and our ability to manufacture products that meet foreign regulatory and commercial requirements in target markets. Sales to customers located outside the U.S. accounts for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. Sales to customers in South Korea represent the majority of our international sales. We have limited experience developing and manufacturing our products to comply with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets. In addition, we are subject to tariff regulations and requirements for export licenses, particularly with respect to the export of some of our technologies. We face numerous challenges in our international expansion, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other geopolitical risks, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, longer accounts receivable requirements and collections, greater bonding and security requirements, difficulties in managing international operations, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international laws. Any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe source raw materials and parts for our products on a global basis, which subjects us to a number of potential risks, including the impact of export duties and quotas, trade protection measures imposed by the U.S. and other countries including tariffs, potential for labor unrest, changing global and regional economic conditions and current and changing regulatory environments. Changes to these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to source raw materials and parts in line with our current cost structure.\nAlthough our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. As a result, we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations.\nWe could also expand our business into new and emerging markets, many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy. Conducting business in such markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase, due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds. Our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with financial institutions that are willing and able to do business with us. Deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure; and therefore, result in exchange gains or losses.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license or permission from the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Energy or other agencies.\nAs an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. We are subject to export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (\u201cITAR\u201d), the Export Administration Regulation (\u201cEAR\u201d), and the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from exporting certain products, importing materials or supplies, or otherwise doing business with restricted countries, businesses or individuals, and require companies to maintain certain policies and procedures to ensure compliance. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which prohibits improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by U.S. and other business entities. Under these laws and regulations, U.S. companies may be held liable for their actions and actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. If we, or our intermediaries, fail to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations, or similar laws of other countries, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to registration under the U.S. State Department\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d). Due to the nature of certain of our products and technology, we must obtain licenses or authorizations from various U.S. government agencies such as DDTC or DOE, before we are permitted to sell such products or license such technology outside of the U.S. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in\nobtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that certain sales will not be prevented or delayed. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products or license technology outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe depend on strategic relationships with third parties, and the terms and enforceability of many of these relationships are not certain.\nWe have entered into strategic relationships with third parties for the design, product development, sale and service of our existing products and products under development, some of which may not have been documented by a definitive agreement and others of which may require renewal. The terms and conditions of many of these relationships allow for termination by the third parties. Termination or expiration of any of these relationships could adversely affect our ability to design, develop and distribute these products to the marketplace. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully negotiate and execute definitive agreements or renewals with any of these third parties, and failure to do so may effectively terminate the relevant relationship.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could harm our brand and operating results.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we assess, and that our auditors attest to, the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement for each fiscal year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls. Inferior internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information and to manage a variety of business processes and activities, including communication with power plants owned by us or our customers and production, manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to us and to third parties. Operating these information technology networks and systems and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to communicate internally and externally with employees, customers, suppliers and others. We also use information technology networks and systems to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and to operate our fuel cell power plants. These information technology systems, many of which are managed by third parties or used in connection with shared service centers, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, or our fuel cell power plant operations may be disrupted, exposing us to performance penalties under our contracts with customers.\nIn addition, information technology security threats - from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data - are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. We\nhave experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. However, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. In addition to the direct potential financial risk as we continue to build, own and operate generation assets, other potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.\nLitigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability, product recalls, product liability, product claims, employment matters, environmental matters, or other aspects of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters, we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of changes to our accounting policies or the methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that could lead us to reevaluate our methods, estimates and judgments.\nIn future periods, management will continue to reevaluate its estimates for contract margins, service agreements, loss accruals, warranty, performance guarantees, liquidated damages and inventory valuation allowances. Changes in those estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition. We will also adopt changes required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).\nOur stock price has been and could remain volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nfailure to meet commercialization milestones;\n\u2022\nfailure to win contracts through competitive bidding processes;\n\u2022\nthe loss of a major customer;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results from the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\ndownward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the securities analysts that cover us or failure to regularly publish reports;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u2022\ninsider selling or buying;\n\u2022\ndemand for our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral technological or economic trends; and\n\u2022\nchanges in United States or foreign political environment and the passage of laws, including, tax, environmental or other laws, affecting the product development business.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock, many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we became involved in securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nProvisions of Delaware and Connecticut law and of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our outstanding securities may make a takeover more difficult.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and in Delaware and Connecticut corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third-party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and board of directors. In addition, certain provisions of FCE FuelCell Energy Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cFCE Ltd.\u201d) Class A Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Shares (\u201cSeries 1 Preferred Shares\u201d), our 5% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d and such shares, the \u201cSeries B Preferred Shares\u201d), our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d and such shares, the \u201cSeries C Preferred Shares\u201d), and our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries D Preferred Stock\u201d and such shares, the \u201cSeries D Preferred Shares\u201d) could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change in our management and board of directors.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum deemed favorable by the stockholder for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes against us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe implementation of our business plan and strategy will require additional capital.\nThe implementation of our business plan and strategy requires additional capital. If we are unable to raise additional capital in the amounts required, or at all, we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan and strategy. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise such additional capital at the times required or in the amounts required for the implementation of our business plan and strategy. In addition, the recent change to a more capital-intensive business model increases the risks of our being able to successfully implement our plans, if we do not raise additional capital in the amounts required. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our business, operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will need to raise additional capital, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do raise additional capital utilizing equity, existing stockholders will suffer dilution. If we do not raise additional capital, our business could fail or be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in debt and equity financings, and these funds may not be available to us when we need them or on acceptable terms, if at all. Such additional financings could be significant. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock, into the public market, including shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of options or warrants, you could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our then-existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business and prospects could fail or be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if additional funds are not secured in the future, we will have to modify, reduce, defer or eliminate parts of our present and anticipated future projects.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock, into the public market, including shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of options or warrants, or perceptions that those sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital in the future.\nWe may be subject to actions for rescission or damages or other penalties in connection with certain sales of shares of our common stock in the open market.\nBetween August 2005 and April 2017, we sold shares of our common stock pursuant to a series of \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales plans. The shares sold pursuant to these sales plans represented a portion of the shares registered by us pursuant to shelf registration statements we filed with the SEC during this time period. While we reported the actual shares sold and proceeds, net of fees, of sales made during each fiscal quarter pursuant to the sales plans in our annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, we did not file or deliver prospectus supplements at the time of or prior to making these sales. Accordingly, these sales may not have been in compliance with applicable federal and/or state securities laws, and the purchasers of such shares may have rescission rights or claims for damages. In addition, to the extent that these sales were not in compliance with applicable federal and/or state securities laws, we may be subject to penalties imposed by the SEC and/or state securities agencies. We have reported these sales to the SEC, and in response to our report, the SEC has opened an informal investigation of these sales. If purchasers successfully seek rescission and/or damages, and/or the SEC and/or state securities agencies impose financial penalties on us which are not covered by insurance, we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary payments, and any such claims, damages or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we believe we would have defenses to such claims or actions if brought, we are unable to predict the likelihood of any claims or actions being brought against us, or the amount of any damages or financial penalties which could be sought against us, or the extent to which any such financial exposure would be covered by insurance.\nThe rights of the Series 1 Preferred Shares and the Series B Preferred Stock could negatively impact our cash flows and could dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders.\nThe terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares issued by FCE Ltd. provide rights to the holder, Enbridge Inc. (\u201cEnbridge\u201d), which could negatively impact us.\nThe provisions of the Series 1 Preferred Shares require that FCE Ltd. make annual payments totaling Cdn. $1,250,000, including (i) annual dividend payments of Cdn. $500,000 and (ii) annual return of capital payments of Cdn. $750,000. These payments will end on December 31, 2020. Additional dividends accrue on cumulative unpaid dividends at a 1.25% quarterly rate, compounded quarterly, until payment thereof. On December 31, 2020, the amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 Preferred Shares of Cdn. $21.1 million and the balance of the principal redemption price of Cdn. $4.4 million must be paid to the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares. FCE Ltd. has the option of making dividend payments in the form of common stock or cash under the terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares.\nWe are also required to issue common stock to the holder of the Series 1 Preferred Shares if and when the holder exercises its conversion rights. The number of shares of common stock that we may issue upon conversion could be significant and dilutive to our existing stockholders. For example, assuming the holder of the Series 1 Preferred Shares exercises its conversion rights after July 31, 2020 and assuming our common stock price is $0.85 (our common stock closing price on October 31, 2018), and an exchange rate of U.S. $1.00 to Cdn. $1.31 (exchange rate on October 31, 2018) at the time of conversion, we would be required to issue approximately 4,192,221 shares of our common stock.\nThe terms of the Series B Preferred Stock also provide rights to their holders that could negatively impact us. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of $50 per share per year, payable either in cash or in shares of our common stock. To the extent the dividend is paid in shares, additional issuances could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and the sale of those shares could have a negative impact on the price of our common stock. A share of our Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 7.0922 shares of our common stock (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $141 per share), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Furthermore, the conversion rate applicable to the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to additional adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.\nConversion of all of the Series D Preferred Shares is contingent upon stockholder approval.\nPursuant to the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), the Series D Preferred Shares may not be converted or redeemed by payment of shares of our common stock if such conversion or redemption would cause us to issue a number of shares equal to 20% or more of our outstanding voting stock as of the date of the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares, until our stockholders approve the issuance of the common stock underlying the Series D Preferred Shares. We have agreed to file a proxy statement with the SEC for the purpose of having our stockholders vote on a proposal to approve such issuances (such approval, the \u201cRequisite Stockholder Approval\u201d), and further agreed to hold such stockholders\u2019 meeting by no later than April 30, 2019. Our stockholders may reject such a proposal, which would impact our ability to make payments in the form of common stock pursuant to the amortization provisions of the Series D Preferred Shares and would require us to make such payments in cash.\nWe may not be able to make cash payments to redeem the Series C Preferred Shares and the Series D Preferred Shares.\nWe have the obligation to make bimonthly redemption payments on the Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares commencing on November 1, 2017 and December 1, 2018, respectively. These mandatory redemption payments may each be made, at our option, in cash or in shares of our common stock or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, except that our right to make payment in shares of common stock is dependent upon our satisfying certain equity conditions, unless such conditions are waived by the holders of the Series C Preferred Shares or the Series D Preferred Shares, as applicable. Among other things, these equity conditions include our continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market or another permitted exchange and our stock maintaining certain minimum average prices and trading volumes during the applicable measurement period. In addition, the Series D Preferred Shares may not be converted or redeemed by payment of shares of our common stock if such conversion or redemption would cause us to issue a number of shares equal to 20% or more of our outstanding voting stock as of\nthe date of the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares, until our stockholders approve the issuance of the common stock underlying the Series D Preferred Shares. If we cannot satisfy the equity conditions, or, with respect to the Series D Preferred Shares, if our stockholders do not approve the issuance of a number of shares equal to 20% or more of our outstanding voting stock as of the date of issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares, we will not be able to make or will be limited in our ability to make (as applicable) our bimonthly mandatory redemption payments in stock, and we would be forced to make such bimonthly payments in cash. We may not have sufficient cash resources at the applicable time to make those cash payments, or to make such cash payments in full. In addition, certain such cash payments may not permitted under the terms of our existing or future indebtedness or may cause us to fail to satisfy financial maintenance covenants.\nFurther, any failure to pay any amounts due to the holders of the Series C Preferred Shares and/or the Series D Preferred Shares, as well as certain other \u201ctriggering events,\u201d including, without limitation, our failure to timely deliver shares, our suspension of trading, our failure to keep reserved for issuance an adequate number of shares of common stock to cover conversion of the Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares, and breaches of certain covenants that are not timely cured, where a cure period is permitted, would permit the holders of the Series C Preferred Shares and/or Series D Preferred Shares (as applicable) to require us to redeem such Series C Preferred Shares and/or Series D Preferred Shares (as applicable), in cash at a price equal to the greater of (i) 125% of the stated value of the Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares being redeemed, as the case may be, plus accrued dividends, if any, and (ii) the market value of the number of shares issuable on conversion of the Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares, as the case may be, valued at the greatest closing sales price during the period from the date immediately before the triggering event through the date we make the redemption payment. However, if we are actually delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market, without obtaining a listing on another national securities exchange, it would constitute a \u201ctriggering event\u201d under the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series C Preferred Stock of FuelCell Energy (the \u201cSeries C Certificate of Designations\u201d) and the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series D Preferred Stock of FuelCell Energy (the \u201cSeries D Certificate of Designation\u201d) and would also cause a failure of the equity conditions that must be satisfied in order for us to make redemptions payments in shares of our common stock. Thus, if we fail to maintain trading or listing, as applicable, or if for any other reason we are required to repurchase the Series C Preferred Shares and/or the Series D Preferred Shares in cash prior to maturity, no assurance can be given that we would have the cash or financial resources available to us to make such a payment (or that we would be permitted to make such a payment under the terms of our indebtedness), and such an acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares rank senior to our common stock with respect to payments upon liquidation, dividends, and distributions.\nThe rights of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares rank senior to the obligations to our common stockholders. Upon our liquidation, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive $1,000.00 per share plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends. Until the holders of Series B Preferred Stock receive their Liquidation Preference in full, no payment will be made on any junior shares, including our Series C Preferred Shares, our Series D Preferred Shares, and shares of our common stock. Upon our liquidation, the holders of Series C Preferred Shares are entitled to receive an amount per Series C Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) the stated value thereof on the date of such payment, plus accrued dividends, if any and (B) the amount per share such holder would receive if such holder converted such Series C Preferred Shares into common stock immediately prior to the date of such payment. Upon our liquidation, the holders of Series D Preferred Shares are entitled to receive an amount per Series D Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) the stated value thereof on the date of such payment, plus accrued dividends, if any and (B) the amount per share such holder would receive if such holder converted such Series D Preferred Shares into common stock immediately prior to the date of such payment. Further, the holders of Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares have the right to participate in any payment of dividends or other distributions made to the holders of common stock to the same extent as if they had converted such preferred shares. The existence of senior securities such as the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares could have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock.\nHolders of the Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares have rights that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nUnder the Series C Certificate of Designation and Series D Certificate of Designation, we are subject to certain covenants that limit our ability to create new series of preferred stock, other than series junior to the Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares with redemption occurring after the maturity date of the Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares, and our ability to incur certain indebtedness. Such restrictions may have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business while the Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares are outstanding.\nOur common stockholders may experience significant dilution upon the issuance of common stock upon conversion of or redemption payments under the Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares.\nThe issuance of common stock as mandatory redemption payments or upon conversion of some or all of the Series C Preferred Shares and/or Series D Preferred Shares will dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of shares of our common stock. As of October 31, 2018, the aggregate outstanding liquidation preference of the Series C Preferred Shares totaled $9.0 million. If this amount was converted into our common stock at the adjusted conversion price in effect as of October 31, 2018 of $1.50, we would have issued 5,994,946 shares of common stock upon conversion (without giving effect to any limitation on conversions). This excludes the effect of any common stock we may issue in lieu of paying bimonthly redemption amounts in cash, which may be made at a price lower than the conversion price. The conversion price of the Series C Preferred Shares is adjustable based on certain events, including in the event of a triggering event and in the event we effect a stock split, combination or similar transaction, to reflect the proportionate (adjusted) trading prices of our common stock before and after the effective date.\nAs of October 31, 2018, the aggregate outstanding liquidation preference of the Series D Preferred Shares totaled $30.7 million. If this amount was converted into our common stock at its initial conversion price, we would have issued 22,231,884 shares of common stock upon conversion (without giving effect to any limitation on conversions). This excludes the effect of any common stock we may issue in lieu of paying bimonthly redemption amounts in cash, which may be made at a price lower than the initial conversion price. The initial conversion price of the Series D Preferred Shares is adjustable based on certain events, including in the event of a triggering event (as defined in the Series D Certificate of Designation), in the event we effect a stock split, combination or similar transaction, to reflect the proportionate (adjusted) trading prices of our common stock before and after the effective date, in the event we issue shares pursuant to our At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, Inc. and Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. dated June 13, 2018, and in the event we issue any securities that are deemed variable price securities (as defined in the Series D Certificate of Designation).\nIf we do not meet the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Global Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market, which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. On November 28, 2018, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) stating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing bid price of our common stock was below the required minimum of $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until May 28, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If at any time before May 28, 2019 the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide us with written confirmation that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and this matter will be closed. We have notified Nasdaq of our intention to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. If we are unable to demonstrate compliance with Rule 5450(a)(1) by May 28, 2019, we can submit an application to transfer our securities to The Nasdaq Capital Market and request an additional 180-day period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or that we will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria. If we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the minimum bid requirement or to meet the other applicable continued listing requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock, reduce our ability to raise additional capital, and result in a triggering event under the Series C Certificate of Designations and the Series D Certificate of Designation.", "PERMNO": 77699, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "FCEL"}
