{"cik": "914122", "company": "Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be negatively impacted by the recent Coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak. An outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. This outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to this COVID-19 outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. Temporary closures of businesses have been ordered and numerous other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. These actions have expanded significantly in the past several weeks and may continue to expand in scope, type and impact. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have significant adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. It is likely that the current outbreak or continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Currently, the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts being taken to mitigate the effects of these actions and the spread of COVID-19 is uncertain.\nA public health pandemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that the Company or its affiliates, employees, suppliers, customers and others may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of shutdowns, travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Such actions may prevent the Company from accessing the facilities of its customers to deliver products and provide services. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers may choose to delay or abandon projects on which it provides products and/or services as a result of such actions. Further, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions or delays in its supply chain as a result of such actions. While a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s businesses have been classified as an essential business in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated, the Company can give no assurance that this will not change in the future or that the Company\u2019s businesses will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nThis COVID-19 outbreak has impacted, and may continue to impact, the Company's office locations and manufacturing facilities, as well as those of its third party vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours and other social distancing efforts. In addition, the Company has modified its business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.\nThe Company may also experience impacts from market downturns and changes in demand for the Company's products and services related to pandemic fears and impacts on its workforce as a result of COVID-19. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in the Company\u2019s markets, or if another significant natural disaster or pandemic were to occur in the future, the Company\u2019s operations in areas impacted by such events could experience further adverse financial impacts due to market changes and other resulting events and circumstances. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain its impact. However, it is likely that the impact of COVID-19 will adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows in fiscal 2020.\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and the substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on demand and pricing in the Company's business. Prices for crude oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are:\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand;\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international drilling activity;\n\u2022\nthe actions of other crude oil exporting nations and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\nworldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources.\nIn early fiscal 2020, pricing for oil and natural gas dropped substantially and may continue to be at depreciated levels through fiscal 2020, which could substantially reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s oil and gas related products. In February 2020, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation failed to reach an agreement on oil production limitations. The news of a failed agreement resulted in a steep decline in global oil prices. On April 12, 2020, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation agreed on oil production cuts, which will begin on May 1, 2020. Additionally, the reduction in worldwide consumption as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has added further downward pressure to oil prices. In response to the decrease in oil prices, international oil companies have announced capital spending budget cuts that are reported to be approximately 30%. At this time the impact of the anticipated reduction in capital spending on the Company's results of operations is uncertain. Generally, when the prices for crude oil and natural gas are higher, demand for the Company\u2019s products increases and the Company is able to negotiate higher prices. On the other hand, when the prices of crude oil and natural gas are lower, demand for the Company\u2019s products decreases and the Company is forced to compete with lower prices and other concessions. Volatility in these commodity prices can also result in circumstances where demand for the Company\u2019s products is suddenly high, but the Company is unable to negotiate higher prices, thereby adversely impacting the Company\u2019s margins and capacity to accept new projects at higher margins. At current commodity prices it is expected that oil and gas customers may drastically cut capital spending and/or delay spending until projects are economically viable.\nThe Company's results in fiscal 2020 may not comply with all covenants in its Senior Credit Facility. In response to the extraordinary steps taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 and the impact of decreased demand for oil and the associated collapse of oil prices, the Company undertook a reforecast to determine the potential financial impact of these events on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The results of the reforecast indicated a risk that the Company could be out of compliance with a debt covenant related to the Senior Credit Facility (as defined below) in the second quarter of 2020. To address the possible covenant compliance issue the Company has made plans to reduce planned capital expenditures and non-essential operating expenses, and if necessary, to repatriate foreign cash to bring the covenant into compliance.\nThe Company may be unable to repay its debt or renew its expiring credit facilities. There is a substantial risk that the Company may not be able to remain in compliance with its credit agreement covenants due to, among other matters, the expected impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the current depressed market for oil and gas. If there were an event of default under the Company's current revolving credit facilities, including as set forth above, the lenders could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. The Company cannot assure that its cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay amounts due under any of the financing arrangements, if accelerated upon an event of default, or, that the Company would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments under any such arrangements. Complying with the covenants under the Company's domestic and/or foreign revolving credit facilities may limit management's discretion by restricting options such as:\n\u2022\nincurring additional debt;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmaking investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing of the Company's shares;\n\u2022\npaying dividends, capital returns, intercompany obligations and other forms of repatriation; and\n\u2022\ncreating liens.\nThe Company\u2019s credit arrangements used by its Middle Eastern subsidiaries are renewed on an annual basis. In addition to these credit arrangements, the Company also obtains project financing in the Middle East on a project-by-project basis. While the Company believes that it will be able to renew its Middle East credit\narrangements and will have continued access to individual project financing, there is no assurance that such arrangements will be renewed or made available in similar amounts or on similar terms and conditions as the current arrangements, or that such individual project financing will be available for projects that the\nCompany is interested in pursuing.\nAny replacement credit arrangements outside of the United States may further limit the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate funds from abroad. Repatriation of funds from certain countries may become limited based upon regulatory restrictions or economically unfeasible because of the taxation of funds when moved to another\nsubsidiary or to the parent company. In addition, any refinancing, replacement or additional financing the Company may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants than those currently applicable to the Company. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with any covenants may be adversely affected by general\neconomic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond management\u2019s control.\nThe Company incurred net losses for its three fiscal years prior to 2019 and it may be unable to maintain its 2019 levels of profitability or positive cash flows in the future. The Company experienced net losses for its three fiscal years prior to 2019. Generating net income and positive cash flows in the future will depend\non the Company's ability to successfully complete and execute its strategic plan. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to maintain its 2019 levels of profitability or positive cash flows in the future. The Company\u2019s inability to successfully maintain profitability and positive cash flows may result in it\nexperiencing a serious liquidity deficiency resulting in material adverse consequences that could threaten its viability.\nGlobal economic weakness and volatility would likely adversely affect operating margins for the Company\u2019s services and products. If the global economy experiences a severe and prolonged downturn, it would likely adversely impact the Company's business. Downturns in such general economic conditions can significantly affect the business of the Company's customers, which in turn affects demand, volume, pricing, and operating margins for the Company's services and products. A downturn in one or more of the Company's significant markets would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Because economic and market conditions vary within the Company's geographic regions, the Company's performance will also vary. In addition, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices, including rising steel prices and surcharges and lower oil and natural gas prices.\nFluctuations in the availability of, and price of steel, may affect the Company's results of operations. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature, and at times, pricing can be highly volatile due to a number of factors beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions, import duties, other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates. This volatility may negatively impact market conditions thus reducing project activity and the Company's results of operations.\nThrough a series of Presidential Proclamations pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as of the date of this filing, U.S. imports of certain steel products are subject to a 25% tariff (exceptions are Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea imports), with retaliatory tariffs imposed by importing countries. These tariffs could lead to increased steel costs and decreased supply availability.\nThe Company regularly updates its quoting system for the movements in steel prices, and attempts to recover these price differentials through price increases in the Company's products; however, the Company is not always successful. Any increase in steel prices that is not offset by an increase in the Company's prices that is accepted by customers could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if the Company is unable to acquire timely steel supplies, it may need to decline bid and order opportunities, which could also have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDelays in the timing of orders for the Company\u2019s products may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results. Since the Company's revenues are based on discrete projects, the Company's operating results in any reporting period could be negatively impacted as a result of large variations in the level of overall market demand or delays in the timing of project execution phases.\nDecreases in government spending on projects using the Company\u2019s products, and challenges to the Company\u2019s non-government customers\u2019 liquidity and availability of capital funds, may adversely impact demand for the Company\u2019s products. Uncertainty about economic market conditions poses risks that the Company's customers may postpone spending for capital improvement and maintenance projects in response to tighter credit markets or negative financial news, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the Company's products. Decreases in U.S. federal and state spending on projects using the Company's products can have negative impact on sales volume from the Company's domestic facilities. Governmental spending on large infrastructure projects in the Gulf Cooperation Council (\"GCC\") countries vary and spending has in the past been curtailed or delayed as a result of reduced public spending budgets in countries which are dependent on oil and gas revenues and their respective price levels.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully negotiate progress-billing arrangements for its large contracts, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s working capital needs and credit risk. The Company sells systems and products under contracts that allow the Company to either bill upon the completion of certain agreed upon milestones, or upon actual shipment of the system or product. The Company attempts to negotiate progress-billing milestones on large contracts to help manage its working capital and to reduce the credit risk associated with these large contracts. Consequently, shifts in the billing terms of the contracts in the backlog from period to period can increase the Company's requirements for working capital and can increase its exposure to credit risk.\nAggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors in the markets in which the Company operates could drive down the Company's profits and reduce the Company's revenue. The Company's business is highly competitive. Some of the Company's competitors are larger and have more resources than the Company. Additionally, many of the Company's products are also subject to competition from alternative technologies and alternative products. In periods of declining demand, the Company's fixed cost structure may limit its ability to cut costs, which may be a competitive disadvantage compared to companies with more flexible cost structures, or may result in reduced operating margins, operating losses and negative cash flows.\nThe Company may be unable to purchase raw materials at favorable prices, or maintain beneficial relationships with its suppliers, which could result in a shortage of supply, or increased pricing. To the extent the Company relies upon a single source for key components of several of its products, the Company believes there are alternate sources available for such components. However, there can be no assurance that the interruption of supplies of such components would not have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and that the Company, if required to do so, would be able to negotiate agreements with alternative sources on acceptable terms.\nThe Company may be subject to claims for damages for defective products. The Company warrants its products to be free of certain defects. The Company has, from time to time, had claims alleging defects in its products. The Company cannot be certain it will not experience material product liability losses in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. While the Company currently has product liability insurance, the Company cannot be certain that its product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities that may be incurred in the future or that such coverage will continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liabilities exceeding the Company's insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations financial position and cash flows.\nThe Company may not be able to recover costs and damages from vendors that supply defective materials. The Company may receive defective materials from its vendors that are incorporated into the Company's products during the manufacturing process. The cost to repair, remake or replace defective products could be greater than the amount that can be recovered from the vendor. Such excess costs could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nProduct and service orders included in the Company\u2019s backlog may be reduced or cancelled. The Company defines backlog as the revenue value resulting from confirmed customer purchase orders that have not yet been recognized as revenue. However, by industry practice, orders may be canceled or modified at any time. If a customer cancels an order, the customer is normally responsible for all finished goods produced or shipped, all direct and indirect costs incurred and also for a reasonable allowance for anticipated profits. No assurance can be given that these amounts will be recovered after cancellation. Any cancellation or delay in orders may result in lower than expected revenue.\nThe Company's results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in international regulations and other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies related to the Company\u2019s international operations. International sales represent a significant portion of the Company's total sales. The Company's sales to foreign customers decreased to 55.6% in 2019 from 61.0% in 2018. The Company's anticipated growth and profitability may require increasing foreign sales volume and may necessitate further international expansion. The Company's results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations, and other factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, burdensome taxes and tariffs and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities and war, could lead to reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales. In addition, these risks can include extraordinarily delayed collections of accounts receivable. Because the Company conducts a significant portion of its business activities in the Middle East, the political and economic events of the countries that comprise the GCC can have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDue to the international scope of the Company\u2019s operations, it is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy. The Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. If the activities of these entities do not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or the Company\u2019s Code of Business Conduct, then violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, and result in an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which its operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nThe Company may be unable to attract and retain its senior management and key personnel. The Company's ability to meet its strategic and financial goals will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of its senior management and key personnel. Future success will also depend in large part on the Company's ability to identify, attract, motivate, effectively utilize and retain highly qualified managerial, sales, marketing and technical personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel or the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could make it more difficult to manage the Company's business and could adversely affect operations and financial results.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from its growth initiatives. The Company's cyclical or general expansion may result in unanticipated adverse consequences, including significant strain on management, operations and financial systems, as well as on the Company's ability to attract and retain competent employees. In the future, the Company may seek to grow its business by investing in new or existing facilities, making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and joint ventures, or constructing new facilities, which could entail a number of additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nstrain on working capital;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention away from other activities, which could impair the operation of existing businesses;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or facilities into existing operations;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel of the acquired business or facility;\n\u2022\nexposure to unanticipated liabilities; and\n\u2022\nfailure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.\nAs a result of these and other factors, including general economic risks, the Company may not be able to realize the expected benefits from future acquisitions, new facility developments, partnerships, joint ventures or other investments.\nThe Company may be impacted by interpretations and changes in tax regulations and legislation which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net income, income tax expense or recovery, and deferred income tax assets or liabilities. Tax rules and regulations, including those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by the Company that may be challenged by the applicable taxation authorities upon audit. Although the Company believes its assumptions, judgements and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or the Company's interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company may be required to reverse previously recorded revenue and profits as a result of inaccurate estimates made in connection with the Company\u2019s percentage-of-completion revenue recognition. Certain domestic divisions have contracts that recognize revenues using periodic recognition of income. For these contracts, the Company uses the \"percentage of completion\" accounting method. This methodology allows revenue and profits to be recognized proportionally over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the cost incurred to date against the total amount of cost expected to be incurred. The effect of revisions to revenue and total estimated cost is recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. These revisions can occur at any time and could be material. On a historical basis, management believes that reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on long-term contracts have been made. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual cost to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results. The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company would prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or fraud.\nAs of January 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to an identified material weakness. The material weakness resulted from an accounting error identified by the Company\u2019s auditors during the audit of the Company\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 related to the Company's revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting. Specifically, the Company had improperly recognized revenue for an open project based on imputed sales amounts greater than the total contracted amount. The accounting error related to this one project was attributable to the Company\u2019s deviation from its standard contract accounting policies and failure to recognize the error during monthly reviews. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If the current material weakness is not remediated, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and the Company could be required to restate its financial results. The failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Company\u2019s ability to report its financial results accurately and in a timely manner or to detect and prevent fraud and could also cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. See further discussion of the material weakness, including the Company's planned remediation procedures, in Item 9A., Controls and Procedures.\nThe Company's information technology systems may be negatively affected by cybersecurity threats. The Company faces risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause the loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. The Company relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage its business, and its business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks. These could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and computer systems. Attacks can be both individual and/ or highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations. The Company employs a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place and frequent backups; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. A successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect the Company's reputation and results of operations, including through lawsuits by third-parties.", "PERMNO": 76052, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "PPIH"}
