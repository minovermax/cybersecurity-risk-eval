{"cik": "1514128", "company": "UNIVERSAL AMERICAN CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInvestors in our securities should carefully consider the risks described below and other information included in this report. This report contains both historical and forward-looking statements. We are making the forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. We intend the forward-looking statements in this report or made by us elsewhere to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with and relying upon these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, trends and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business. In making these statements, except as required by applicable securities laws, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. If any of the following risks or uncertainties develops into actual events, this could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline materially and investors in our securities could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to the WellCare Merger\nThe proposed Merger may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nOn November 17, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with WellCare Health Plans, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"WellCare\"), and Wind Merger Sub, Inc. a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WellCare, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the \"Merger\") and certain other transactions will be effected with the Company surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WellCare. This transaction is referred to as the WellCare Transaction. Although we have received approval of the Merger from our stockholders, the Merger remains subject to various other closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from Texas and New York insurance regulators. The Company or WellCare may be unable to obtain the necessary approvals or otherwise satisfy the conditions required to complete the WellCare Transaction on a timely basis or at all. If any condition to the closing of the Merger is neither satisfied nor waived, the Merger may not be completed. There can be no assurance that any of the remaining conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene, delay or result in a failure to complete the Merger. Failure to complete the Merger could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 If the Merger is not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company for consideration that is equivalent or more attractive than that in the Merger Agreement, on terms acceptable to us, our stock price may decline significantly.\n\u2022 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement prohibits us from pursuing alternative transactions to the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement prohibits us from soliciting, initiating and knowingly facilitating or encouraging any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative acquisition proposal from any third party. This provision prevents us from seeking offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the pending Merger. In addition, we do not have the ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal since our stockholders have voted to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nThe proposed Merger could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion or termination of the Merger, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent WellCare's prior written consent. This may result in our inability to take certain actions that we believe are in the best interests of the Company. In addition, the proposed Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our ongoing business operations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks to our business and operating results include, but are not limited to the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger:\n\u2022 the diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the Merger, including ongoing integration efforts;\n\u2022 the impairment of our ability to motivate, retain and hire key personnel, including our senior management;\n\u2022 difficulties maintaining relationships with doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, members, beneficiaries, agents, vendors and others with whom we conduct business; and\n\u2022 the outcome of any legal proceeding that may be instituted against the Company or others relating to the Merger Agreement and the costs related thereto.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and subsequent rules promulgated by CMS, including any repeal, replacement or modification to the ACA, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe ACA was signed into law in March 2010 and legislated broad-based changes to the U.S. health care system which continue to have a material impact on our business. There is considerable discussion within the new Presidential administration and Congress about repealing and replacing the ACA. At this time, it is uncertain whether, when, and what changes will be made to the ACA, and what impact such changes could have on our business. However, any changes to the ACA, including through any repeal and replacement to the ACA, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nDue to the complexity of the ACA, the final impact remains difficult to predict and quantify. In addition, we believe that any impact from the health reform legislation could potentially be mitigated by certain actions we may take in the future including modifying future Medicare Advantage bids to compensate for such changes. For example, the anticipation of additional revenues from Star bonuses or reduced CMS reimbursement rates are factored into the anticipated level of benefits included in our Medicare Advantage bids for the upcoming year. However, we will need to dedicate significant resources and expense to complying with these new rules and there is a possibility that this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe provisions of these new laws include the following key points, which are discussed further below:\n\u2022 reduced Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates, beginning in 2012;\n\u2022 implementation of a quality bonus for Star Ratings beginning in 2012;\n\u2022 accountable care organizations, beginning in 2012;\n\u2022 limitation on the federal tax deductibility of compensation earned by individuals for certain types of companies, beginning in 2013;\n\u2022 stipulated minimum medical loss ratios, or MLRs, beginning in 2014;\n\u2022 non-deductible health insurance industry fee, beginning in 2014; and\n\u2022 coding intensity adjustments, with mandatory minimums beginning in 2014.\nReduced Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates-Beginning in 2012, the Medicare Advantage \"benchmark\" rates transition to target Medicare fee-for-service cost benchmarks of 95%, 100%, 107.5% or 115% of the calculated Medicare fee-for-service costs. The transition period is 2, 4 or 6 years depending upon the applicable county and 2017 will be the final transition year. The counties are divided into quartiles based on each county's fee-for-service Medicare costs. We estimate that approximately 61%, 32% and 6%, respectively, of our January 1, 2017 membership resides in counties where the Medicare Advantage benchmark rate will equal 95%, 115%, and 107.5%, respectively, of the calculated Medicare fee-for-service costs.\nMedicare Advantage payment benchmarks have been cut over the last several years, with additional funding reductions to be phased in as noted above. On February 1, 2017, CMS issued its 2018 Advance Notice and Draft Call Letter (the \"Advance Notice\") detailing preliminary 2018 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. As is customary, CMS has invited public comment on these preliminary rates before issuing its final rates for 2018 in April 2017. The Advance Notice proposes to provide a slight overall increase to Medicare rates for 2018 and we are continuing to evaluate the overall impact in our markets. At this time, CMS is not implementing any major proposed policy changes with respect to the exclusion of in-home health risk assessments for risk adjustment purposes. If implemented, such change would result in significant additional funding declines for the Company. We will continue to evaluate proposed changes detailed in the Advance Notice, some of which could adversely affect our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans in the future.\nTo address any rate reductions, we may have to reduce benefits (to the extent permitted), increase member premiums, modify existing operations, reduce profit margins, or implement some combination of these actions. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business by:\n\u2022 Limiting our ability to maintain our current membership levels;\n\u2022 Making our products less competitive or attractive to prospective members;\n\u2022 Causing us to exit many service areas;\n\u2022 Causing us to increase member premiums, lower benefits or impose higher member contributions (e.g., copayments); and\n\u2022 Require more intensive medical and operating cost management in order to respond to the lower reimbursements.\nContinued reductions of Medicare Advantage payment rates may result in Medicare Advantage being no longer economically viable for us in many markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage\nprogram. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address such rate freezes/reductions and failure to do so may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nImplementation of quality bonus for Star Ratings-Beginning in 2012, Medicare Advantage plans with an overall \"Star rating\" of three or more stars (out of five) based on historical performance are eligible for a \"quality bonus\" in their basic premium rates. Plans receiving Star bonus payments are required to use the additional dollars to provide \"extra benefits\" for the plans' enrollees to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with minimum loss ratio requirements resulting in a competitive advantage for those plans rather than a direct financial impact. In addition, beginning in 2012, Medicare Advantage Star ratings affect the rebate percentage available for plans to provide additional member benefits (plans with quality ratings of 3.5 stars or above will have their rebate percentage increased from a base rate of 50% to 65% or 70%). In all cases, this rebate percentage is lower than the pre-ACA rebate percentage of 75%. Beginning in 2015, in order to qualify for bonus payments, plans must have a 4 Star rating or higher. For 2017, the Company earned a 4.5 Star rating for its flagship TexanPlus\u00ae plan in Houston/Beaumont, which accounts for 57% of our December 31, 2016 membership, and maintained a 4 Star rating for our Today's Options PPO plan in New York and Maine. Collectively, over 70% of our members are in Plans with a Star rating of 4.0 or greater.\nNotwithstanding continued efforts to improve or maintain our Star ratings and other quality measures, there can be no assurances that we will be successful. Accordingly, our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses or increased rebates, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership, and reduce profit margins.\nIn addition, CMS has indicated that plans with a Star rating of less than 3.0 for three consecutive years may be subject to termination. While we do not currently have any plans with a rating below 3.0, our inability to maintain Star ratings of 3.0 or better for a sustained period of time could ultimately result in plan termination by CMS which could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows and results of operations. Also, the CMS Star ratings/quality scores may be used by CMS to pay bonuses to Medicare Advantage plans that enable those plans to offer improved benefits and/or better pricing. Furthermore, lower quality scores compared to our competitors may result in us losing potential new business in new markets or dissuading potential members from choosing our plan in markets in which we compete. Lower quality scores compared to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth.\nAccountable Care Organizations-The ACA established Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, as a tool to improve quality and lower costs through increased care coordination in the Medicare fee-for-service program. CMS established the Shared Savings Program to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs. To date, we have partnered with numerous groups of healthcare providers and currently participate in sixteen MSSP ACOs and two Next Generation ACOs. ACOs are entities that contract with CMS to serve the Medicare fee-for-service population with the goal of better care for individuals, improved health for populations and lower costs. ACOs share savings with CMS to the extent that the actual costs of serving assigned beneficiaries are below certain trended benchmarks of such beneficiaries and certain quality performance measures are achieved. We provide a variety of services to the ACOs, including care coordination, analytics and reporting, technology and other administrative services to enable these physicians and their associated healthcare providers to deliver better quality care, improved health and lower healthcare costs for their Medicare fee-for-service patients.\nTo date, we have invested significant capital into our ACO business and have not made money. We expect to continue to invest significant amounts into this business in 2017 and there can be no assurance that we will recoup any of these costs.\nUnder the MSSP, CMS has not made any payments to ACOs for a measurement year until the second half of the following year, which negatively impacts our cash flows. In order to receive revenues from CMS under the MSSP, the ACO must meet certain minimum savings rates (i.e. save the federal government money) and meet certain quality measures. More specifically, an ACO's medical expenses for its assigned beneficiaries during a relevant measurement year must be below the benchmark established by CMS for such ACO. On the quality side, for 2017, the MSSP requires ACOs to meet thirty-one quality measures, which CMS may vary from time to time. Notwithstanding our efforts, our ACOs may be unable to meet the required savings rates or may not satisfy the quality measures, which may result in our receiving no revenues and losing our substantial investment. In addition, as the MSSP is a new program, it presents challenges and risks associated with the timeliness and accuracy of data and interpretation of complex rules, which may impact the timing and amount of revenue we can recognize and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to recoup any of our investment in this new business. Further, there can be no assurance that we will maintain positive relations with our ACO partners which may result in certain of the ACOs terminating our relationship, which will result in a potential loss of our investment. We continue to evaluate our portfolio of ACOs based on a variety of factors, including the level of commitment by the physicians in the ACO and the likelihood of the ACO achieving shared savings. Based on this evaluation, we have reduced the number of our ACOs and may further reduce the number of our ACOs in the future.\nOn June 4, 2015, CMS released a final rule updating provisions related to the MSSP in the second contract period for years 2016-2019. This final rule made several changes, including allowing ACOs to participate in Track 1 for a second agreement period with the same sharing rate (up to 50%), establishing a new Track 3 with two-sided risk with additional flexibilities, providing new beneficiary-level claims data that will improve overall ACO information, and easing certain administrative requirements.\nAdditionally, the CMS Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, or CMMI, launched the Next Generation ACO Model, a new value-based payment model that encourages providers to assume greater risk and provides enhanced rewards for coordinating the healthcare of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The Next Generation ACO Model provides ACOs with additional tools not found in the MSSP but used in the Medicare Advantage program to improve quality and lower cost, including preferred networks, negotiated discounts and beneficiary incentives. The Next Generation ACO Model offers two risk arrangements with prospectively assigned beneficiaries under which a Next Generation ACO can share up to 80% or 100% of savings (losses) generated in each performance year depending on the financial arrangement selected by the ACO.\nFor 2017, three of our ACOs have selected Track 2 which involves two-sided risk. In addition, we have two Next-Generation Model ACOs which also involve two-sided risk. This means that the ACO will be financially responsible to the extent that actual medical expenditures of the ACO beneficiaries are higher than the ACOs benchmark. There can be no assurance that any of our ACOs will achieve savings in 2016, 2017 or thereafter, which could result in substantial financial losses.\nIn June 2016, CMS issued its final rule with respect to changes in the MSSP benchmarking methodology, among other changes. The new rule will gradually incorporate regional expenditure data into rebased benchmarks over the course of multiple three-year ACO agreement periods. CMS finalized an approach that treats ACOs differently depending on whether they have spending higher or lower than that of their region but all benchmarks would eventually incorporate 70 percent regional expenditure data. CMS may issue additional rules or guidance which may materially and adversely affect our ACOs' ability to achieve shared savings, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nIn addition, CMS, the US Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Trade Commission, the US Department of Justice, and various states have adopted or are considering adopting new legislation, rules, regulations and guidance relating to formation and operation of ACOs.\nSuch laws may, among other things, require ACOs to become subject to financial regulation such as maintaining deposits of assets with the states in which they operate, the filing of periodic reports with the insurance department and/or department of health, or holding certain licenses or certifications in the jurisdictions in which the ACOs operate. Failure to comply with legal or regulatory restrictions may result in CMS terminating an ACOs agreement with CMS and/or subjecting an ACO to loss of the right to engage in some or all business in a state, payment of fines or penalties, or may implicate federal and state fraud and abuse laws relating to anti-trust, physician fee-sharing arrangements, anti-kickback prohibitions or prohibited referrals, any of which may adversely affect our operations and/or profitability.\nStipulated Minimum MLRs-Beginning in 2014, the ACA stipulates a minimum MLR of 85% for Medicare Advantage plans. This MLR which is calculated at a plan level, takes into account benefit costs, quality initiative expenses, the ACA Fee and taxes. Financial and other penalties may result from failing to achieve the minimum MLR ratio. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 our Medicare Advantage plans exceeded the minimum MLR, as defined by CMS. Complying with such minimum ratio by increasing our medical expenditures or refunding any shortfalls to the federal government could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins, results of operations, and our statutory capital.\nNon-deductible health insurance industry fee (\"ACA Fee\")-Beginning in 2014, the new healthcare reform legislation imposed an annual aggregate health insurance industry fee of $8.0 billion, increasing to $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016 (with increasing annual amounts thereafter) on health insurance premiums, including Medicare Advantage premiums, that is not deductible for income tax purposes. In 2017, the ACA Fee has been suspended for one year. Our share of the ACA Fee is based on our pro rata percentage of premiums written during the preceding calendar year compared to the industry as a whole, calculated annually. The ACA Fee, first expensed and paid in 2014, adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Advantage business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For our continuing operations, we paid fees of $21.7 million, $25.5 million and $22.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, based on prior year net written premiums. We do not expect to pay any fees in 2017, due to the one year suspension of the ACA Fee. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the liability for the ACA Fee will be estimated and recorded in full once the entity provides qualifying health insurance in the corresponding period with a corresponding deferred cost that is to be amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable calendar year. For statutory reporting purposes, the ACA Fee will be expensed on January 1 in the year of payment, rather than amortized to expense over the year. The ACA Fee is included in other operating costs; however, will be factored in when calculating the stipulated minimum MLR. Our effective income tax rate increased in 2014 as a result of the ACA Fee, and will remain at a higher level in future years in which the ACA Fee is assessed. In addition, because the ACA Fee is not deductible for federal income tax purposes and we are a smaller company than our peers with smaller revenues and with smaller profits, our effective tax rate is likely to be significantly higher than that of our peers.\nCoding intensity adjustments-Under the ACA, the coding intensity adjustment instituted in 2010 became permanent, resulting in mandated minimum reductions in risk scores of 4.91% in 2014 increasing each year to 5.91% in 2018. These coding adjustments may adversely affect the level of payments from CMS to our Medicare Advantage plans.\nLimitation on the federal tax deductibility of compensation earned by individuals-Beginning in 2013, with respect to services performed during and afterward, for health insurance companies, the federal tax deductibility of compensation is limited under Section 162(m)(6) of the Code to $500,000 per individual and this limitation does not contain an exception for \"performance-based compensation.\" In September 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on this compensation deduction limitation which provided additional information regarding the definition of a health\ninsurance issuer. Based on our analysis of the final regulations, we believe we are not subject to the limitation. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.2 million related to prior years and $1.7 million related to the first nine months of 2014. Prior to the promulgation of the final regulations, our application of this limitation had increased our effective tax rate by approximately 60 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 200 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2012. However, there is a risk that the Internal Revenue Service or other regulators may disagree with our interpretation, which could result in higher taxes.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation; compliance with laws and regulations is complex and expensive, and any violation of the laws and regulations applicable to us could reduce our revenues and profitability and otherwise adversely affect our operating results and/or impact our ability to participate in Government programs such as Medicare, the MSSP and the Next Generation ACO Model.\nThere is substantial federal and state governmental regulation of our business. Several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, such as the ACA, the False Claims Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which we refer to as HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), the Medicare Modernization Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, anti-kickback laws, Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act and \"Do Not Call\" regulations, and their state equivalents have created administrative and compliance requirements for us. The requirements of these laws and regulations are continually evolving, and the cost of compliance may have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. The evolution of existing laws, rules, or regulations, their enforcement, or changes in their application or interpretation, as well as new laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial position, or results of operations and may expose us to increased liability. As laws and regulations evolve, the costs of compliance, which are already significant, will tend to increase. If we fail to comply with existing or future applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil, criminal or administrative penalties, including termination of our contracts with CMS. Different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on our business or assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business. In addition, we are subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products.\nLaws and regulations governing Medicare and other state and federal healthcare and insurance programs are complex and subject to significant interpretation. As part of the ACA, CMS, State regulatory agencies and other regulatory agencies have been exercising increased oversight and regulatory authority over our Medicare and other businesses. Compliance with such laws and regulations is subject to CMS audit, other governmental review and investigation, including SEC investigations, and significant and complex interpretation. CMS audits our Medicare Advantage plans with regularity to ensure we are in compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and CMS instructions. Our Medicare Advantage plans will likely be subject to an audit in 2017. There can be no assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with all such laws, rules and regulations in connection with these audits, reviews and investigations, and at times we have been found to be out of compliance. Failure to be in compliance can subject us to significant regulatory action including significant fines, penalties, cancellation of contracts with governmental agencies or operating restrictions on our business, including, without limitation, suspension of our ability to market to and enroll new members in our Medicare plans, termination of our contracts with CMS, exclusion from Medicare and other state and federal healthcare programs and inability to expand into new markets or add new products within existing markets.\nCertain of our subsidiaries provide products and services to various government agencies. As a government contractor, we are subject to the terms of the contracts we have with those agencies and applicable laws governing government contracts. As such, we may be subject to False Claim Act litigation (also known as qui tam litigation) brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that the government contractor submitted false claims to the government.\nLaws in each of the states in which we operate our health plans, insurance companies and other businesses also regulate our sales practices, operations, the scope of benefits, rate formulas, delivery systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint systems, enrollment requirements, claim payments, marketing, and advertising. These state regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval or notice of new products, premium rates, benefit changes and specified material transactions, such as dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, inter-company agreements, and the filing of various financial and operational reports.\nWe are also subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations, including SEC investigations, to verify our compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations. State departments of insurance routinely audit our health plans and insurance companies for financial and contractual compliance. State departments of health audit our health plans for compliance with health services. State attorneys general, the SEC, CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Government Accountability Office, state departments of insurance and departments of health and Congressional committees may also conduct audits and investigations of us. We have historically incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs to respond to governmental reviews, audits and investigations, and we expect these costs to increase over time as regulation increases and becomes more complex and as regulatory agencies and Congressional committees become more sophisticated and thorough.\nAny adverse review, audit or investigation, or changes in regulations resulting from the conclusion of reviews, audits or investigations, could result in:\n\u2022 repayment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts;\n\u2022 imposition of civil or criminal penalties, fines or other sanctions on us;\n\u2022 loss of licensure or the right to participate in Medicare and other government-sponsored programs;\n\u2022 suspension of marketing and enrollment privileges;\n\u2022 damage to our reputation in various markets;\n\u2022 legislative or regulatory changes that affect our business and operations;\n\u2022 increased difficulty in marketing our products and services; and\n\u2022 prohibiting the expansion to new markets or the addition of new products in existing markets.\nAny of these events could make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services, reduce our revenues and profitability and otherwise adversely affect our reputation and/or operating results. CMS from time to time releases proposed or amended rules, regulations, and guidance that, if adopted, would, among other things, place tighter restrictions on marketing processes relative to the Medicare Advantage program and Medicare prescription drug benefit program. Depending upon the final content of these regulations, if CMS proposes and adopts them, compliance with and enforcement of the regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are also subject to a federal law commonly referred to as the \"Anti-Kickback Statute.\" The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the payment or receipt of any \"Remuneration\" that is intended to induce referrals or the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service that may be reimbursed,\nin whole or in part, under a Federal Health Care Program, such as Medicare. It also prohibits the payment or receipt of any remuneration that is intended to induce the recommendation of the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any such item or service. Violations of such statute or other laws could result in substantial monetary penalties and could also include exclusion from the Medicare program.\nIn addition, in connection with the establishment of the MSSP and the Next Generation ACO Model, the relevant federal agencies issued waivers of certain laws governing potential fraud and abuse involving federal health care program beneficiaries (e.g. the Stark Law, Civil Monetary Penalties Law, and the Anti-Kickback Statute). These waivers have been and may be modified, altered, restricted, or otherwise changed from time to time by the relevant federal agencies. The objective of the federal waivers is to foster innovative financial arrangements that will assist an ACO in meeting the goals of the MSSP or Next Generation ACO Model. As part of our ACO business, we enter into arrangements with various third parties such as laboratory companies and other providers, that are intended to be covered by such waivers. Further, state regulators or agencies may not recognize the federal waivers and view such arrangements as violating state laws. There can be no assurances that we may not be subject to state or federal action with respect to any arrangement purported covered by the waivers. However, if such arrangements are found not to be covered by such waivers, we may be subject to substantial penalties and/or fines and could be precluded from participating in government programs such as the MSSP or Next Generation ACO Model. Further, the restriction or modification of any waivers or the imposition of state action may require our ACOs to terminate certain arrangements which may result in a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we fail to effectively design and price our products properly and competitively, if the premiums and fees we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate, our profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nWe use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments to providers, and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Our premiums for our Medicare Advantage business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends. The profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums. In addition, we have and may continue to pursue additional opportunities in the Medicaid risk business, which presents additional challenges around pricing and underwriting. Failure to adequately price our products or estimate medical costs may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, during 2015, we significantly grew our Medicare Advantage membership in our Northeast markets, increasing membership by approximately 35%. We incurred losses in 2015 in our Northeast Medicare Advantage markets as a result of higher than expected utilization and a lag in adequate premium for our new members. While we have taken steps to address these issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain profitably in these markets.\nReductions in funding for Medicare programs could materially reduce our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe generate virtually all our revenue from the operation of our Medicare Advantage plans and our ACOs. As a result, our revenue and profitability are dependent, in part, on government funding levels for all of these various programs. The rates paid to Medicare Advantage health plans like ours are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, such as upper payment limits established by CMS, a member's health profile and status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix, member eligibility categories and the plan's risk scores. Future Medicare rate levels and overall funding for Medicare, may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain and/or reduce overall medical expenses, including the Advance Notice and Draft Call Letter described above, and other budgetary and fiscal constraints. The government is continuously examining Medicare Advantage health plans like ours in comparison to Medicare fee-for-service payments, and this examination could result in a reduction in payments to Medicare Advantage health plans like ours. Changes in the Medicare program or funding may affect our ability to operate under the Medicare program or lead to reductions in the amount of reimbursement, eliminate coverage for some benefits or reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for Medicare or increase member premium.\nFailure to control and/or reduce our administrative operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe level of our administrative operating costs significantly affects our profitability. During 2016, our administrative expense ratio in our Medicare Advantage business was 11.2%. Beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage plans are required to meet an 85% medical loss ratio and we are subject to a non-deductible insurance industry fee, which is suspended for 2017, that is approximately 1.6% of premium for 2016. Thus, in order to generate meaningful earnings, we will need to continue to reduce our administrative operating expenses from current levels. We are smaller than many of our competitors which makes it harder to reduce administrative operating expenses. Reducing administrative expenses has and may continue to require us to reduce our headcount, which can place significant strains on our operations. If we are unable to reduce our administrative operating expenses to better match our smaller size, or if we are unable to effectively manage operating our business with a reduced headcount, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our revenue is tied to our Medicare businesses and regulated by CMS and if our government contracts are not renewed or are terminated, our business would be substantially impaired.\nWe earn most of our revenue from our Medicare Advantage businesses in which CMS is not only our largest customer but also our regulator. If we are unable to maintain a constructive relationship with CMS, our business could suffer materially. As a government contractor, we provide our Medicare Advantage benefits and other services through a limited number of contracts with federal government agencies. These contracts generally have terms of one to three years and are subject to non-renewal by the applicable agency. All of our government contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations. In addition, a government agency may suspend our right to add new members if it finds deficiencies in our provider network or operations, as was the case for a significant portion of the 2011 selling season as a result of CMS sanctions. If we are unable to renew, or to successfully re-bid or compete for any of our government contracts, or if any of\nour contracts are terminated, our business could be substantially impaired. If any of those circumstances were to occur, we would likely pursue one or more alternatives, such as\n\u2022 seeking to enter into contracts in other geographic markets;\n\u2022 seeking to enter into contracts for other services in our existing markets; or\n\u2022 seeking to acquire other businesses with existing government contracts.\nIf we were unable to do so, we could be forced to cease conducting business. In this event, our revenues and profits would decrease materially.\nCompetition in the healthcare industry is intense, and if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Some of our competitors have more established businesses with larger market share, more established reputations and brands and greater financial resources than we have in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future. Medicare Advantage plans are generally bid upon or renewed annually. We compete for members on the basis of the following and other factors:\n\u2022 price;\n\u2022 the size, location, quality and depth of provider networks;\n\u2022 benefits provided;\n\u2022 quality and extent of services; and\n\u2022 reputation.\nIn addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reforms and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium rate increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, our relationship with our providers in various markets, and our possible exit from or entrance into markets, among other issues, could also affect our membership levels.\nWe compete based on innovation and service, as well as on price and benefit offering. We may not be able to develop innovative products and services which are attractive to clients. Moreover, although we need to continue to expend significant resources to develop or acquire new products and services in the future, we may not be able to do so. We cannot be sure that we will continue to remain competitive, nor can we be sure that we will be able to market our products and services to clients successfully at current levels of profitability.\nConsolidation within the industries in which we operate may lead to increased competition. Strategic combinations involving our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur business strategy is evolving and may involve pursuing new lines of business or strategic transactions and investments, some of which may not be successful.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing significant change and our business strategy is continuing to evolve to meet these changes. In order to profitably grow our business, we may need to expand into new lines of business beyond our historical core of providing managed care and health insurance products, which may involve pursuing strategic transactions, including potential acquisitions of, or investments in, related or unrelated businesses. In addition, we may seek a variety of strategic transactions, including, without limitation, divestitures of existing businesses or assets, a merger or\nconsolidation with a third party that results in a change in control (such as the WellCare Transaction), a sale or transfer of all or a significant portion of our assets or a purchase by a third party of our securities that may result in a minority or control investment by such third party.\nFor example, over the past several years we partnered with groups of providers to form numerous ACOs and have invested significant capital into this business. While our ACO business continues to improve, it has lost money since inception. Going forward, we may pursue additional opportunities in the healthcare sector which may involve us providing capital and/or reinsurance to health plans. We may also pursue various strategic transactions with providers, independent practice associations and other provider groups, including acquisitions, joint ventures and other arrangements. Each of these opportunities may require the investment of significant capital and management attention. There can be no assurance that we will be successful with any of these potential new ventures and we could suffer significant losses as a result, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may finance future acquisitions, investments or opportunities through available cash, equity issuances or through the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Future acquisitions or investments, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, could subject us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the assumption of contingent liabilities;\n\u2022 potential losses from unanticipated litigation, undiscovered or undisclosed liabilities or unanticipated levels of claims, relating to either the pre- or post-acquisition periods;\n\u2022 risks and uncertainties associated with transaction counterparties;\n\u2022 the loss of key personnel and business relationships;\n\u2022 difficulties associated with assimilating and integrating new personnel, assets, intellectual property and operations of an acquired company or business;\n\u2022 the distraction of our management from existing programs and initiatives in pursuing such strategic transactions; and\n\u2022 where indebtedness is incurred, general risks associated with higher leverage, including increased debt service obligations, reduced liquidity and reduced access to capital markets.\nIn addition, any strategic transaction that we may pursue may not result in anticipated benefits to us and may result in unforeseen costs that, in each case, may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in governmental regulation or legislative reform could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe federal government and the states in which we operate extensively regulate our various businesses. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than shareholders. From time to time, Congress has considered various forms of \"Patients' Bill of Rights\" legislation, which, if adopted, could alter the treatment of coverage decisions under applicable federal employee benefits laws. There have also been legislative attempts at the state level to limit the preemptive effect of federal employee benefits laws on state laws. If adopted, these types of limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer, and how we interact\nwith our policyholders, members, providers and the public. Healthcare laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and differing interpretations.\nIn addition, changes in the political climate or in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations, including the repeal, replacement and/or modification to the ACA could adversely affect our business by, among other things:\n\u2022 imposing additional license, registration, or capital reserve requirements;\n\u2022 increasing our administrative and other costs;\n\u2022 forcing us to undergo a corporate restructuring;\n\u2022 increasing mandated benefits without corresponding premium increases;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to engage in inter-company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries;\n\u2022 adversely affecting our ability to operate under the Medicare program and to continue to serve our members and attract new members;\n\u2022 changing the manners or the basis upon which CMS reinsures us or pays premium to us, or upon which our members pay premiums;\n\u2022 forcing us to alter or restructure our relationships with providers and agents;\n\u2022 restricting our ability to market our products;\n\u2022 increasing governmental regulation or provision of healthcare services;\n\u2022 requiring that health plan members have greater access to non-formulary drugs;\n\u2022 expanding the ability of health plan members to sue their plans;\n\u2022 requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems; and\n\u2022 prohibiting us from participating in existing or future programs and systems.\nWhile it is not possible to predict when and whether fundamental policy changes would occur, policy changes on the local, state and federal level could fundamentally change the dynamics of our industry, such as policy changes mandating a much larger role of the government in the health care arena. Changes in public policy could materially affect our profitability, our ability to retain or grow business, or our financial condition. State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us which could result in new regulations that increase the cost of our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCompliance with and enforcement of the existing and any proposed regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data and information systems and we sustain a cyber-attack or other data security or privacy breach, we could incur significant regulatory fines or penalties, significant damage to our reputation and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCybersecurity attacks and data security breaches have become increasingly common, particularly in the healthcare industry. While we take precautions to prevent such attacks, there can be no assurance that we or one of our vendors or other third parties that have access to our information will not be subject to an attack or breach in the future. Our business depends significantly on efficient, effective and secure information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business.\nWe have various information systems that support our operating segments. The information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in, among other things, marketing and sales tracking, underwriting, billing, claims processing, medical management, medical care cost and utilization trending, financial and management accounting, reporting, planning and analysis and e-commerce. These systems also support on-line customer service functions, provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analyses of medical expenses and outcome data.\nCybersecurity attacks can arise in a variety of manners, including from third parties who may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, vendors, providers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our members or beneficiaries. In addition, while we maintain certain standards for vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to a security breach as a result of their failure to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements.\nOur information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable, if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity, or if we fail to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports, have regulatory or other legal problems, have increases in operating and administrative expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our business strategies, sustain losses due to fraud or suffer other adverse consequences.\nTo the extent we fail to maintain effective information systems, we may need to contract for these services with third-party management companies, which may be on less favorable terms to us and significantly disrupt our operations and information flow. In addition, we have outsourced the operation of certain of our data centers to independent third parties and may from time to time obtain and/or outsource additional services or facilities from or to other independent third parties. Dependence on third parties for these services and facilities may make our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform as agreed. In addition, we could be subject to hackers or other forms of cyber-security attacks that bypass our information technology security systems. If a hacker or cyber-security attack were to be successful, we could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our systems, negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with our members, agents, providers, regulators and other stakeholders and significant fines, penalties and other costs.\nFurthermore, our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability and loss. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by cancellation of contracts, loss of members and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented.\nThere can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our expanding operations, integrating new systems, protecting our proprietary information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows.\nCMS's risk adjustment payment system, including the manner in which we estimate CMS revenues and the results of any RADV audits and budget neutrality factors, make our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive and other adjustments to our results of operations.\nAll of the Medicare Advantage programs we offer are subject to Congressional appropriation. As a result, our profitability is dependent, in large part, on continued funding for government healthcare programs at or above current levels. The reimbursement rates paid to health plans like ours by the federal government are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors such as a member's health status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix, member eligibility categories, and the plans' risk scores.\nCMS has implemented a risk adjustment model that apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans according to health severity. The risk adjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under this model, rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on a comparison of our beneficiaries' risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government's original Medicare program.\nUnder the risk adjustment methodology, all Medicare Advantage plans must capture, collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to Medicare Advantage plans. We generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. As a result of this process, it is difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue or profitability. CMS may also change the manner in which it calculates risk adjusted premium payments in ways that are adverse to us. For example, in the past, CMS proposed excluding for risk adjustment purposes the diagnosis codes obtained from in-home health risk assessments unless such codes are subsequently validated by a clinical encounter with a qualified provider. Over the past several years, we have utilized in-home health risk assessments for our Medicare Advantage members. Accordingly, if implemented, this change could have a material adverse effect on our payments from CMS and our results of operations. In addition, our own risk scores for any period may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the payments we receive from CMS and our Medicare premium revenue. Because diagnosis coding is a manual process, there is the potential for human error in the recording of codes and there can be no assurance that physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers are submitting accurate codes to us or that they will be successful in improving the accuracy of recording diagnosis code information and therefore our risk scores. There is ongoing litigation in multiple jurisdictions challenging certain Medicare plans' coding practices, the results of which may have a material adverse effect on our business practices and financial results. In addition, CMS continues to evaluate the overall risk adjustment methodology that is used to pay Medicare Advantage plans. Any major changes to this methodology or findings that our coding practices of our providers do not comply with applicable laws, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nBeginning in 2008, CMS announced its intention to engage in a pilot program to more extensively audit a select group of Medicare Advantage plans in the area of hierarchical condition category, or HCC, coding for the determination of risk score revenue. These audits were labeled \"Risk Adjustment Data Validation\" audits, or RADV. RADV audits review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans. On February 24, 2012, CMS released a final RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology which clarified many of the uncertainties arising from prior proposals. Under the final rule, CMS has indicated that it will now reduce the extrapolated contract level error rate found during the audits based on the error rate found in the\nGovernment's 'benchmark' audit data for Medicare fee-for-service population CMS has begun to conduct RADV audits of select Medicare Advantage plans and our PPO plan offered by American Progressive Life & Health Insurance Company of New York was audited based on 2012 revenue using 2011 dates of service. As of December 31, 2012, this PPO plan had approximately 12,000 members. We have not yet heard from CMS regarding the results of this audit. We are also subject to national RADV audits from time to time. CMS may discover coding errors during these or other RADV audits, which could require us to make significant payments to CMS or require significant payment adjustments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. On December 22, 2015, CMS issued a proposed statement of work related to a material expansion of RADV audits, with the ultimate goal of subjecting all Medicare Advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted RADV audit for each contract year.\nCoincident with phase-in of the risk-adjustment methodology, CMS also adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans by a \"budget neutrality\" factor. CMS implemented the budget neutrality factor to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced during the transition to the risk-adjustment payment model. CMS first developed the payment adjustments for budget neutrality in 2002 and began to use them with the 2003 payments. CMS began phasing out the budget neutrality adjustment in 2007 and fully eliminated it in 2011. The risk adjustment methodology and phase-out of the budget neutrality factor will reduce our plans' premiums unless our risk scores increase. We do not know if our risk scores will increase in the future or, if they do, that the increases will be large enough to offset the elimination of this adjustment. As a result of the CMS payment methodology described previously, the amount and timing of our CMS monthly premium payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. In addition, the possibility exists that CMS may reduce revenues in the future for plans whose risk scores have increased significantly greater than the general Medicare average increase in risk scores. If our risk scores increase significantly greater than the general Medicare average increase, and CMS introduces this approach, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, CMS continues to evaluate the overall risk adjustment methodology that is used to pay Medicare Advantage plans. Any changes to this methodology could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. For example, CMS has begun to change the manner in which it calculates risk scores. Historically, CMS has calculated risk scores using diagnosis data from the Risk Adjustment Processing System, or RAPS. However, it is beginning to phase-in the use of diagnosis data from the Encounter Data System, or EDS, in calculating risk scores. The phase-in from RAPS to EDS could result in different risk scores from each dataset, and could have a material adverse effect on our risk scores, resulting CMS premiums and financial results.\nIn February 2016, CMS finalized rules regarding \"overpayments\" to Medicare Advantage plans which may arise under a variety of circumstances, including risk adjustment. The failure to report and return overpayments may result in significant potential liabilities under the False Claims Act and the imposition of other administrative penalties by CMS, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The precise interpretation, impact, and scope of the final rules regarding overpayments are not clear and are subject to pending litigation.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we changed the way we estimate changes in risk-adjusted premiums receivable from CMS based on health diagnoses for our Medicare Advantage business. Under our previous methodology, we estimated changes in CMS premiums related to revenue adjustments based upon the diagnosis data submitted to CMS and ultimately accepted by CMS. We believe this method resulted in a lag in recognizing revenue for changes in our members' medical conditions that will ultimately be included in the final risk adjusted premium paid by CMS. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the development and validation of a model that allows us to better estimate the risk-adjusted premiums that will ultimately be realized based upon our historical experience for members that have a full year of experience and members that have joined during the\nannual enrollment period or special election period. We believe this method serves to better reflect risk-adjusted premiums in the period in which they are earned and is considered a change in estimate under ASC 250, Accounting Changes.\nThis change in estimate resulted in the accelerated recognition of $9.2 million in additional current year premium revenue, or $0.08 per share, after tax for the year ended December 31, 2016. Under our previous estimation process, this revenue would not have been recognized until the related diagnosis data was submitted to and accepted by CMS, typically in the first and second quarters of the subsequent year. If our estimation process is incorrect, it could result in material changes to our previously-reported revenues and profitability for any particular period.\nThe bidding process for our Medicare Advantage plans may adversely affect our profitability.\nPayments for Medicare Advantage health plans are based on a bidding process that may decrease the amount of premiums paid to us or cause us to increase the benefits we offer to our members. We are required to submit Medicare Advantage bids annually, approximately six months in advance of the corresponding benefit year. We attempt to use the best available member eligibility, claims and risk score data at the time of developing the bids. Furthermore, we make actuarial assumptions about the utilization of benefits in our plans and the impact of government regulations. However, these assumptions are subject to significant judgment and we cannot be assured that the data and assumptions used at the time of bid development will prove to be correct and that premiums will be sufficient to cover member benefits plus a reasonable margin. For example, our 2015 bid for our Northeast markets did not appropriately consider the unexpected 35% growth in membership that we experienced during 2015 which resulted in us incurring losses in these markets.\nFurthermore, our premiums from CMS relating to any prescription drug benefit are subject to risk corridor payments from or to CMS. Variances from our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs that exceed certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. The estimate of the risk corridor payment requires us to consider factors that may not be certain, including differences in interpretation of data as compared with CMS.\nIf our bid assumptions are too low and member claims are higher than anticipated, we could be required to expend significant unanticipated amounts and incur losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and results of operations.\nBecause our Medicare Advantage premiums, which generate most of our Medicare Advantage revenues, are fixed by contract, we are unable to increase our Medicare Advantage premiums during the contract term if our corresponding medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates which can adversely affect our results of operations.\nMost of our Medicare Advantage revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. The principal costs consist of claims payments, capitation payments and other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed on an annual basis by contract, and we are obligated during the contract period to provide or arrange for the provision of healthcare services as established by the federal government.\nWe are unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then-current term. If our medical expenses exceed our estimates, we generally cannot recover costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections in the contract year through higher premiums. As a result, our profitability depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to adequately predict and effectively manage our medical expenses related to the provision of healthcare services. Accordingly, the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported claims, known as IBNR, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. If our estimates of reserves are inaccurate, our ability to take timely corrective actions or to otherwise establish appropriate premium pricing could be adversely affected. Failure to adequately price our products or to estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, to the extent that CMS or Congress takes action to reduce the levels of payments to Medicare Advantage providers, our revenues would be adversely affected.\nWe estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, medical inflation, historical developments, such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, historically, our medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated. The principal factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed our estimates are:\n\u2022 increased utilization of medical facilities and services;\n\u2022 increased utilization of prescription drugs (e.g., new treatments or specialty pharmacy drugs such as those associated with treatments for Hepatitis C);\n\u2022 increased cost of services;\n\u2022 our membership mix;\n\u2022 variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business;\n\u2022 product changes or benefit level changes;\n\u2022 periodic renegotiation of hospital, physician and other provider contracts, or the consolidation of these entities;\n\u2022 membership in markets lacking adequate provider networks;\n\u2022 changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them;\n\u2022 termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee-for-service arrangements or loss of membership;\n\u2022 the occurrence of acts of terrorism, public health epidemics or other wide spread health emergencies such as higher incidence of the flu, severe weather events or other catastrophes;\n\u2022 the introduction of new or costly treatments, specialty pharmacy drugs (such as drugs to treat Hepatitis C) and technologies;\n\u2022 medical cost inflation or changes in the economy;\n\u2022 government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes;\n\u2022 contractual disputes with hospitals, physicians and other providers; and\n\u2022 other unforeseen occurrences.\nBecause of the relatively high average age of the Medicare population, medical expenses for our Medicare Advantage plans may be particularly difficult to control. We may not be able to continue to manage these expenses effectively in the future. If our medical expenses increase, our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable.\nWe hold reserves for expected claims, which are estimated, and these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If actual claims exceed reserve estimates, our results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur benefits incurred expense reflects estimates of IBNR. We, together with our internal and external consulting actuaries, estimate our claim liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors. Actual conditions, however, could differ from those assumed in the estimation process, and those differences could be material. Due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in these assumptions, the actual amount of benefit expense that we incur may be materially more or less than the amount of IBNR originally estimated, and materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements for a particular period under different conditions or using different assumptions. We make adjustments, if necessary, to benefits incurred expense when the criteria used to determine IBNR change and when we ultimately determine actual claim costs. If our estimates of IBNR are inadequate in the future, our reported results of operations will be adversely affected. Further, our inability to estimate IBNR accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions or otherwise establish appropriate premium pricing, further exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on our results.\nIn addition, we may experience higher than expected loss ratios if health care costs exceed our estimates. We seek to take appropriate actions in an effort to reverse any upward trend in our loss ratios; however, we can make no assurances that these actions will be sufficient. We also cannot give assurance that our loss ratios will not continue to increase beyond what we currently anticipate, and any increases could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information that require significant compliance costs, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.\nRegulations under HIPAA require us to comply with standards regarding the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties, such as healthcare providers, business associates and our members. The HITECH Act broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of HIPAA and mandates individual notification in the event of certain breaches of individually identifiable\nhealth information and provides enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations. These regulations impose standards for common healthcare transactions, such as:\n\u2022 claims information, plan eligibility, and payment information;\n\u2022 unique identifiers for providers and employers;\n\u2022 security;\n\u2022 privacy; and\n\u2022 enforcement.\nHIPAA also provides that to the extent that state laws impose stricter privacy standards than HIPAA privacy regulations, HIPAA does not preempt the state standards and laws.\nGiven the complexity of the HIPAA regulations, the possibility that the regulations may change, and the fact that the regulations are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to maintain compliance with the HIPAA requirements is uncertain and the costs of compliance are significant. Furthermore, a state's ability to promulgate stricter laws, and uncertainty regarding many aspects of state requirements, make compliance more difficult. To the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA, payments to us may be delayed or denied. Additionally, the costs of complying with any changes to the HIPAA regulations may have a negative impact on our operations. We could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions for failing to comply with the HIPAA health information provisions, which could result in the incurrence of significant monetary penalties. In addition, our failure to comply with state health information laws that may be more restrictive than the regulations issued under HIPAA could result in additional penalties.\nCompliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. A business associate is a person or entity, other than a member of our work force, who on behalf of us performs or assists in the performance of a function or activity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or provides legal, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation or financial services. Because we are ultimately responsible for many of the acts of our business associates, any failure of such third parties to comply with HIPAA or other privacy regulations could cause us to incur civil or criminal penalties, including significant damage to our reputation.\nIn 2013, the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued the omnibus final rule on HIPAA privacy, security, breach notification requirements and enforcement requirements under the HITECH Act, and a final regulation for required changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule for the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA. Our failure to comply with the omnibus final rule or the failure of our business associates to comply with HIPAA, the HITECH ACT, GINA, or other privacy regulations could cause us to incur civil or criminal penalties, including significant damage to our reputation.\nLegal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in the managed care business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\nWe face a significant risk of class action lawsuits and other litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses. Due to the nature of our businesses, we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our business operations, such as the\ndesign, management and offering of products and services. The following are examples of the types of potential litigation and regulatory investigations we face:\n\u2022 claims under the False Claims Act or State whistleblower statutes;\n\u2022 investigations by the SEC;\n\u2022 claims by government agencies, including CMS, relating to compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022 provider disputes involving our right to properly withhold amounts relating to sequestration and other compensation-related matters, including termination of provider contracts;\n\u2022 claims relating to sales and marketing practices;\n\u2022 claims relating to the denial or delay of health care benefit payments;\n\u2022 claims relating to improper coding;\n\u2022 challenges to the use of software products used in running our business;\n\u2022 claims relating to provider marketing;\n\u2022 anti-kickback claims;\n\u2022 medical malpractice or negligence actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers' alleged malpractice or negligence;\n\u2022 medical malpractice or negligence actions related to the operation of our care management programs;\n\u2022 allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities;\n\u2022 allegations of discrimination;\n\u2022 claims related to the failure to disclose business practices;\n\u2022 allegations of breaches of duties to members or customers;\n\u2022 allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022 claims relating to inadequate or incorrect disclosure or accounting in our public filings;\n\u2022 allegations of agent misconduct;\n\u2022 claims related to deceptive trade practices;\n\u2022 claims related to the quality of our networks (e.g., credentialing) or the quality of medical services rendered by our providers (e.g., vicarious liability for medical services); and\n\u2022 claims relating to customer audits and contract performance (including our contracts with CMS for our Medicare Advantage and ACO companies).\nAs a provider of health insurance, we are subject to the False Claims Act, which provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person or entity who it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. Violations of the False Claims Act are punishable by treble damages and penalties of up to a specified dollar amount per false claim. In addition, a special provision under the False Claims Act allows a private person (for example, a \"whistleblower\" such as a disgruntled employee, competitor or member) to bring an action under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government alleging that an entity has defrauded the federal government and permits the private person to share in any settlement of, or judgment entered in, the lawsuit.\nPlaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, and punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, formal and informal inquiries, subpoenas and books and record examinations, from state and federal regulators and other authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of actions we face with certainty, and we have incurred and are incurring expenses in the defense of our past and current matters. We also may be subject to additional litigation in the future. Litigation could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or the changes in our operations that could result from litigation. The defense of any these actions may be time-consuming and costly, and may distract our management's attention. In addition, we could suffer significant harm to our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business.\nPotential liabilities may not be covered by insurance or indemnity, insurers or indemnifying parties may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance or indemnification coverage may be inadequate. In some cases, treble damages may be sought. In addition, some types of damages, such as punitive damages or damage for willful acts, may not be covered by insurance. The cost of business insurance coverage has increased, and may in the future increase, significantly. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost-effective basis, if at all.\nThe health care industry continues to receive significant negative publicity regarding the public's perception of it. This publicity and public perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, in some cases resulting in large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation, and governmental review of industry practices.\nThese factors, as well as any negative publicity about us in particular, could adversely affect our ability to market our products or services and to attract and retain members, may adversely affect our relationship with providers, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on the accuracy of information provided by CMS regarding the eligibility of an individual to participate in our Medicare Advantage plans, the list of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries assigned to our ACOs, and any inaccuracies in those lists could cause CMS to recoup premium payments from us with respect to members who turn out not to be ours, or could cause us to pay benefits in respect of members who turn out not to be ours, which could reduce our revenue and profitability, or result in us expending resources in attempting to manage the care of such individuals.\nPremium payments that we receive from CMS are based upon eligibility lists produced by federal and local governments. From time to time, CMS requires us to reimburse it for premiums that we received from CMS based on eligibility and dual-eligibility lists that CMS later discovers contained individuals who were not in fact residing in our service areas or eligible for any government-sponsored program or were eligible for a different premium category or a different program. We may have already provided services to these individuals and reimbursement of amounts paid on behalf of services provided to them may be unrecoverable. In addition to recoupment of premiums previously paid, we\nalso face the risk that CMS could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our profitability would be reduced as a result of this failure to receive payment from CMS if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup these payments from them.\nFurther, our ACOs receive periodic lists of beneficiaries that are assigned to the ACOs. These lists are based on claims experience for certain primary care services. Since CMS adjusts the lists of assigned beneficiaries from time to time, we may expend significant resources on individuals who are not in fact ultimately assigned to our ACOs. This may have a material adverse effect on our ACO business. Further, CMS provides our ACOs with certain historic and current data based on paid claims which is used for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, (a) used by CMS to (i) establish the benchmark for an ACO; (ii) calculate beneficiary assignment; and (iii) calculate shared savings; and (b) used by our ACOs to (i) track and trend current medical costs of assigned beneficiaries; (ii) project cost savings, if any, relative to the benchmark established by CMS; and (iii) stratify assigned beneficiaries to identify those with chronic conditions who may benefit from care coordination activities. The failure of CMS to provide timely or accurate data or errors in our processing and evaluation of such data could have a material adverse effect on our ACO business.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members and ACO beneficiaries, our profitability could be adversely affected and we may be precluded from operating in some markets.\nWe contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our Medicare Advantage products and ACOs encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. In some circumstances, these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. Our operations and profitability are significantly dependent upon our ability to not only enter into appropriate cost-effective contracts with hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers that have convenient locations for our members in our geographic markets, but to maintain good working relationships with such providers. In addition, as the healthcare system rapidly moves to a value-based payment system, the success of each of our Medicare and ACO businesses is and will continue to be highly dependent on achieving high quality scores. This requires significant collaboration with providers to improve customer experience and close gaps in care. If we cannot maintain satisfactory relationships with providers to positively impact quality, our ability to achieve profitability may be negatively impacted.\nMore specifically, the success of our ACO business is highly dependent on building and maintaining strong relationships with our ACO providers, and if the providers in our ACOs become dissatisfied with our performance or disengaged, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ACO business.\nIn addition, given the rapidly changing environment for healthcare providers, many providers are considering joining larger health systems, including hospitals, which could negatively impact our business. In the long term, our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will affect the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in that market. Any difficulty in contracting with providers in a market could preclude us from renewing or from entering our Medicare contracts in that market. We will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets or continuing to provide services in existing markets. CMS has indicated that it intends to audit Medicare Advantage plans with respect to network adequacy. There can be no assurance that CMS will not identify areas where we fail to meet applicable network adequacy requirements.\nWe may be unable to maintain our relationships with our network providers or enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand to contract with us, demand higher\npayments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for members, disruption of benefits to our members, or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician specialty groups, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physicians, hospitals, independent practice associations and other groups of providers may compete directly with us. Such competition may impact our relationships with those or other providers, adversely affect our products, benefits, or pricing of such products, and may require us to incur additional costs to change our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for a fixed, per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members. This type of contract is referred to as a \"capitation\" contract. The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. In addition, there continues to be significant competition in our markets to employ, contract with or acquire physicians and physician practices which could make it difficult for us to maintain our current relationships. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations, resulting in loss of membership or higher healthcare costs or other adverse effects.\nA reduction in the number of members in our Medicare Advantage plans could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOver the past several years, we have reduced our Medicare Advantage footprint to focus on markets where we believe we can positively impact the cost and quality of healthcare. These service area reductions have caused our aggregate membership numbers to fall. In the future, we may choose to exit additional markets and may suffer additional membership losses. If we are unable to maintain and grow our membership levels, our business could deteriorate which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A reduction in our membership could also make it more difficult to maintain or lower our administrative expense ratio to appropriate levels. The principal factors that could contribute to the loss of membership are:\n\u2022 regulatory changes, such as the 45 Day Call Letter issued in February 2017 by CMS and the final rule to be issued in April 2017;\n\u2022 competition in premium or plan benefits from other health care benefit companies, many of which are larger and have greater resources than we do;\n\u2022 competition from physicians or other provider groups who may elect to form their own health plans;\n\u2022 poor Star Ratings relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 inability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members;\n\u2022 increases in our premiums or changes in our benefits provided;\n\u2022 our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan;\n\u2022 negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally;\n\u2022 insufficient distribution channels in a particular area;\n\u2022 general economic conditions that induce beneficiaries to cancel their coverage; and\n\u2022 catastrophic events, such as epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, man-made catastrophes and other unforeseen occurrences.\nOur Medicare Advantage membership remains concentrated in certain geographic areas, which exposes us to unfavorable changes in local competition, reimbursement rates, provider pricing power, benefit costs, and other economic conditions.\nOur Medicare Advantage membership is significantly concentrated in Texas, New York and Maine. This significant concentration subjects us to greater risk to the extent that adverse conditions develop in one of these areas. Adverse changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates payable to providers or increased competition in those geographic areas where we have concentrated membership could result in a disproportionate impact to us as compared to our competitors and material adverse impact on our operating results. Our membership has been and may continue to be affected by adverse and/or uncertain general economic conditions, such as the broad impact of a decline in oil prices and its impact on the Houston market. As a result, we may not be able to achieve, maintain, or grow profits and our revenue and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and its growth are subject to risks related to difficulties in the financial markets and general economic conditions.\nThe financial markets around the world may from time-to-time experience significant disruption, including, among other things, volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades and declining or indeterminate valuations of many investments and declines in real estate values. While these conditions have not historically impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, largely because our financing has generally come from internal cash generation, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies or that any future deterioration in markets or confidence will not impair our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.\nEconomic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, many of which we cannot predict. Among the potential effects could be write-downs in the value of investments we hold and an inability to access credit markets should we require external financing. In addition, it is possible that economic conditions, and resulting budgetary concerns, could prompt the federal, state and local governments to make changes in Medicare programs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the future disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions, or the effects these disruptions and conditions could have on us.\nWe may suffer losses due to fraudulent activity, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nTraditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans have been subject to fraudulent activity perpetrated by actual and purported beneficiaries and providers, as well as others. In 2009, we incurred significant losses as a result of a fraudulent scheme or a group of similar fraudulent schemes. While we have undertaken efforts to prevent these schemes, there can be no assurance that we will not again\nbecome the target of fraud, or that we will detect fraud prior to incurring losses. The need to expend effort and construct infrastructure to combat fraud requires significant expenditures. These expenditures, and losses arising from any fraud that we suffer, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, such as:\n\u2022 earthquakes;\n\u2022 hurricanes;\n\u2022 floods, tornadoes;\n\u2022 pandemic health events such as avian influenza; and\n\u2022 man-made disasters, such as acts of terrorism, political instability and military actions.\nFor example, a natural or man-made disaster could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and members who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. Disasters also could disrupt communications and financial services and other aspects of public and private infrastructure, which could disrupt our normal business operations.\nA natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies' ability to pay principal or interest on their securities.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions or dispositions it may have an adverse effect on our business, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rapid changes and complexity of our operations has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management, operations systems, accounting systems, internal control systems and financial resources. As part of our strategy, we have pursued, and may continue to pursue, growth through acquisitions, joint ventures and similar strategic partnerships, to the extent the WellCare Transaction is not consummated. For example, our acquisition of APS Healthcare in 2012 was not successful. From time to time, we may also seek to dispose of assets or businesses that no longer meet our strategic objectives or for other reasons. For example, we sold our APS businesses in 2015 and sold our Traditional Insurance business and TotalCare Medicaid business in 2016. Generally, as part of these sale transactions, the seller is required to indemnify the buyer for certain matters per the contractual terms of the sale agreements. In addition, in connection with the sale of the Traditional Insurance business, all net retained Traditional Insurance business of American Progressive Life and Health Insurance Company of New York (American Progressive) was reinsured on a 100% coinsurance basis to Constitution Life Insurance Company, a Texas domiciled stock corporation which we sold to Nassau Re as part of the transaction. If Constitution Life were to default in its obligations under the reinsurance treaty, American Progressive would ultimately be responsible for the ceded business, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations.\nWe anticipate that joint ventures with health care providers will be critical to our growth strategies. Joint ventures have certain risks that are different from acquisitions, including, but not limited to, the selection of appropriate partners, challenges with respect to governance of the joint venture, pursuit of growth opportunities acceptable to all the parties, maintaining a positive relationship with our joint venture partner(s), and disruption that may occur should the joint venture terminate for any reason.\nThese transactions involve numerous risks, some of which we have experienced in the past, such as:\n\u2022 difficulties in the integration of operations, technologies, products, systems and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022 diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022 potential losses from unanticipated litigation, undiscovered or undisclosed liabilities or unanticipated levels of claims relating to either the pre- or post-acquisition periods;\n\u2022 inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs;\n\u2022 loss of key customer accounts;\n\u2022 loss of key provider contracts or renegotiation of existing contracts on less favorable terms; and\n\u2022 other systems and operational integration risks.\nIn addition, we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more governmental agencies when making acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions, which may require a public hearing, regardless of whether we already operate a plan in the state in which the business to be acquired is located. We may be unable to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition, disposition or other strategic transaction in a timely manner, or at all. Even if we identify suitable acquisition targets, we may be unable to complete acquisitions or obtain the necessary financing for acquisitions on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nTo the extent we complete a strategic transaction; we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from it because of operational factors or difficulties in integrating the following or other aspects of acquisitions with our existing businesses:\n\u2022 additional employees who are not familiar with our operations;\n\u2022 new provider networks, which may operate on terms different from our existing networks;\n\u2022 additional members, who may decide to transfer to other healthcare providers or health plans;\n\u2022 disparate information technology, claims processing and record keeping systems; and\n\u2022 accounting policies, some of which require a high degree of judgment or complex estimation processes, such as estimates of reserves, IBNR claims, valuation and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based compensation and income tax matters.\nFor all of the above reasons, we may not be able to implement our acquisition strategy successfully, which could materially adversely affect our growth plans and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, in the event of an acquisition or investment, you should be aware that we may issue stock that would dilute stock ownership, incur debt that would restrict our cash flow, assume liabilities, incur large and immediate write-offs, incur unanticipated costs, divert management's attention from our existing business, experience risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, or lose key employees from the acquired entities or our historical business.\nOur reliance upon third party administrators and other outsourcing arrangements may disrupt or adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend, and may in the future increase our dependence, on independent third parties for significant portions of our operations, including pharmacy benefit administration, data center operations, data network, claims processing, enrollment, premium billing, call centers, voice communication services, data processing and payment and other systems-related support, among others. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to the third parties' failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. In the future, this dependence may increase as we may outsource additional areas of our business operations to additional vendors. There can be no assurance that any conversion or transition of business process functions from the Company to a vendor or between vendors will be seamless and, oftentimes, these projects result in significant operational challenges that cause financial difficulties. In addition, if our relationships with our outsourcing partners are significantly disrupted or terminated for any reason or if the financial terms of such outsourcing partners changes materially, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe have outsourced portions of our administrative functions, including, without limitation, the operation of several of our data centers, call centers and claims processing to independent third parties and may from time to time obtain additional services or facilities from other independent third parties. Dependence on third parties for these services and facilities may make our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform as agreed. Incorrect information from these entities could generate inaccurate or incomplete membership and payment reports concerning our Medicare eligibility and enrollment, and claims information used by CMS to determine plan benefit subsidies and risk corridor payments. This could cause us to incur additional expense to utilize additional resources to validate, reconcile and correct the information. We have not been able to independently test and verify some of these third party systems and data. There can be no assurance that future third party data will not disrupt or adversely affect our plans' relationships with our members or our results of operations. A change in service providers, or a move of services from internal operations to a third party, or a move of services from a third party to internal operations, could result in significant operational challenges, a decline in service quality and effectiveness, increased cost or less favorable contract terms, which could adversely affect our operating results. Some of our outsourced services are being performed offshore. CMS requires attestations from plans that utilize the services of offshore vendors as to the vendors' ability to perform delegated functions. Prevailing economic conditions and other circumstances could prevent our offshore vendors' ability to adequately perform as agreed, which would impair our ability to provide the requisite attestations to CMS and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, significant failure by a third party to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or applicable law could subject us to fines or other sanctions or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.\nOur future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our senior management and other key employees. While we currently have employment agreements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. In addition, the pending WellCare Transaction generally creates unease with portions of our workforce. The loss of the services of any of our senior management, or other key employees could harm our business. In addition, recruiting and retaining the personnel we require to effectively compete in our\nmarkets may be difficult. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.\nWe may be responsible for the actions of our third party agents, and restrictions on our ability to market would adversely affect our revenue.\nIn regulatory proceedings and reviews and other litigation, regulators and our members sometimes claim that agents failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, or acted improperly in other ways, and that we are responsible for the alleged failure. We could be liable for contractual and extra-contractual damages on these claims and other penalties, such as a suspension from marketing and enrolling new members. We cannot assure you that any future claim will not result in material liability in the future. Federal and state regulators increasingly scrutinize the marketing practices of insurers, such as Medicare Advantage plans and their marketing agents, and there is no guarantee that regulators will not continue to scrutinize the practices of our Medicare Advantage plans and our marketing agents, and that such practices will not expose us to liability.\nWe rely on our marketing and sales efforts for a significant portion of our premium revenue. The federal government and state governments in the states in which we currently operate permit marketing but impose strict requirements and limitations as to the types of marketing activities that we may conduct. If our marketing efforts were to be prohibited or curtailed, our ability to increase or sustain membership would be significantly harmed, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in our Medicare Advantage business if we cannot recruit and retain insurance agents, which could materially adversely affect our business and ability to compete.\nWe distribute our Medicare Advantage products principally through employee career agents and independent agents who we recruit and train to market and sell our products. We also engage managing general agents from time to time to recruit agents and develop networks of agents in various states. Strong competition exists for sales agents. We compete with other insurance companies for productive agents, primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. It can be difficult to successfully compete for productive agents with larger insurance companies that have higher financial strength ratings than we do. Our business and ability to compete will suffer if we are unable to recruit and retain insurance agents or if we lose the services provided by our managing general agents.\nA significant portion of our assets are invested in fixed income securities and other securities that are subject to market fluctuations.\nA significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and other investment securities. Our portfolio can be viewed on our web site, www.universalamerican.com, in the \"Investors\" section. Our reference to the web site in this report is not intended to, and does not, incorporate the information contained in the web site into this report.\nThe fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets generally fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions and these variations have been exacerbated recently. The fair value of our investments in fixed income securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease in a direct relationship with fluctuations in interest rates; in addition, these values and prospective income have been adversely affected by general economic conditions. Moreover, actual net investment income or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment or at various\nfinancial statement dates as a result of interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions and other factors.\nBecause our investment securities are classified as available for sale, we reflect changes in the fair value of these securities in our consolidated balance sheets. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and changes in the values of securities we hold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not have adequate intellectual property rights in our brand names for our health plans, and we may be unable to adequately enforce these rights.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to market our health plans under the brand names that we own or license. We may not have taken enforcement action to prevent infringement of our marks and may not have secured registrations of the other brand names that we use in our business. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. Other businesses may have prior rights in our brand names or in similar names, which could cause market confusion or limit or prevent our ability to use these marks or prevent others from using similar marks. If we are unable to prevent others from using our brand names, or if others prohibit us from using them, our revenues could be adversely affected. Even if we are able to protect our intellectual property rights in our brands, we could incur significant costs in doing so.\nOur results of operations and stockholders' equity could be materially adversely affected if we have an impairment of our intangible assets.\nDue to our past acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets. As of December 31, 2016, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $71 million, or approximately 9% of our total assets as of such date.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we perform periodic assessments of our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. This impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1 of the current year, or more frequently if circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. During each quarter, we perform a review of certain key components of our valuation of our reporting units, including the operating performance of the reporting units compared to plan (which is the primary basis for the prospective financial information included in our annual goodwill impairment test), our weighted average cost of capital and our stock price and market capitalization.\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, or other indicators of fair value, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations and target capital requirements), long term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Forecasts and long term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long term business plan and strategy. During our forecasting process, we assess revenue trends, medical cost trends, operating cost levels and target capital levels. Significant factors affecting these trends include changes in membership, premium yield, medical cost trends, contract renewal expectations and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments.\nAlthough we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate at the time made, the use of different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the analysis and resulting conclusions. In addition, due to the long term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of healthcare reforms as discussed in Item 1, \"Business-Regulation.\"\nWe use a range of discount rates that correspond to a market based weighted average cost of capital. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit based on the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. The most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations include the risk free rates and equity risk premium. Company specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty.\nThe passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units' operations could cause these assumptions used in our analysis to change materially in the future. If our assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected.\nFuture events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 decreases in business growth;\n\u2022 decreases in forecasted margins;\n\u2022 the loss of significant contracts;\n\u2022 decreases in earnings projections;\n\u2022 increases in the weighted average cost of capital; and\n\u2022 increases in the amount of required capital for a reporting unit.\nNegative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges.\nOur ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries is restricted and our cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected which could restrict our ability to pursue new opportunities.\nBecause we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, such as payment of principal and interest on our debt obligations. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by state departments of insurance. Our health plan and insurance company subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions they can pay us. These laws and regulations also limit the amount of management fees our subsidiaries may pay to our management subsidiaries and their other affiliates without prior notification to, or in some cases approval of, state regulators. If these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries' request to pay dividends to us, the funds available to us would be limited, which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends that exceed specified amounts from these subsidiaries, or, in some states, any amount. The pre-approval and notice requirements vary from state to state, and the discretion of the state regulators, if any, in approving or disapproving a dividend is not\nalways clearly defined. Subsidiaries that declare non-extraordinary dividends must usually provide notice to the regulators in advance of the intended distribution date. If the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiaries' requests to pay dividends to us or to pay management and other fees to affiliates, the funds available to us would be limited, which could impair our ability to implement our business and growth strategy and satisfy our debt obligations, or we could be required to incur additional indebtedness to fund these strategies.\nIn addition, one or more of these states could increase the minimum statutory capital level from time to time. States have also adopted risk-based capital requirements based on guidelines adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which tend to be, although are not necessarily, higher than existing statutory capital requirements. Regardless of whether the states in which we operate maintain or adopt risk-based capital requirements, the state departments of insurance can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining additional statutory capital is in the best interests of our insureds. Any increases in these requirements could materially increase our reserve requirements. In addition, as we continue to expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities, such as our expansion of Medicare Advantage products and health plans in new markets, we may be required to maintain additional statutory capital reserves. In either case, our available funds could be materially reduced, which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy.\nIn the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund our debt obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected.\nOur stock price may be volatile and could drop precipitously and unexpectedly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE. The prices of publicly traded stocks often fluctuate. The price of our common stock may rise or fall dramatically without any change in our business performance. For example, if our WellCare Transaction is not consummated, our stock price may decline and possibly significantly. Specific issues and developments related to our company or those generally in the health care and insurance industries, the regulatory environment, the capital markets and the general economy may cause this volatility. Our common stock is thinly traded which exposes our stock price to potentially larger fluctuations than other companies and may make it more difficult to buy or sell our stock. The principal events and factors that may cause our stock price and trading volume to fluctuate include:\n\u2022 failure to consummate the WellCare Transaction;\n\u2022 changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022 the relatively small size of the public float of our common stock and the small volume of trading and the general liquidity in the market for our common stock;\n\u2022 variations in our operating results;\n\u2022 changes in the market's expectations about our future operating results;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care or insurance industries generally;\n\u2022 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;\n\u2022 news reports relating to trends in our markets;\n\u2022 acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry, including news reports or perceptions regarding mergers and acquisitions activity; and\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur.\nSome of our shareholders, directors and executive officers may have interests that conflict with, are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally.\nSome of our directors (including their affiliated companies) and executive officers have and may continue to have significant equity ownership in our company, employment, indemnification and severance benefit arrangements, potential rights to other benefits on a change in control and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance that result in their having interests that may differ from the interests of our shareholders generally. The receipt of compensation or other benefits by our directors or executive officers in connection with any acquisition or disposition may make it more difficult to retain their services after the acquisition or disposition, or require the combined company to expend additional sums to continue to retain their services. In addition, we may enter into transactions, including the sale of stock or assets or similar transactions, with our shareholders, directors or executive officers that may raise a conflict of interest. Further, the current concentration of equity ownership may discourage acquisition transactions. In addition, some of our directors are affiliated with entities that own significant portions of our common stock. Such shareholders may have different investment time horizons than other shareholders and may otherwise have interests that are different than other shareholders.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nBecause of our status as a public company, we are required to test our financial, internal, and management control systems to meet obligations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These control systems relate to our corporate governance, corporate control, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures, and financial reporting and accounting systems. Our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. Among these inherent limitations are the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The individual acts of some persons or the collusion of two or more people can circumvent controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nIf we conclude that we do not have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may also uncover material weaknesses, significant deficiencies or other issues with these controls that could also result in adverse investor reaction. These results may also subject us to adverse regulatory consequences.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the notes.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon conversion of the notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. In addition, certain of our shareholders hold meaningful amounts of our common stock and such shareholders may sell their shares. Future sales of our common stock may depress the market price of our common stock. The issuance and/or sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances and/or sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nRisks Related to our Convertible Senior Notes:\nThe notes are not protected by restrictive covenants.\nUnlike an indenture for high yield notes or a customary credit agreement, the indenture governing the notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. In general, the indenture contains limited covenants or other provisions to afford protection to holders of the notes in the event of a fundamental change or other corporate transaction involving us.\nThe notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior in right of payment to the notes will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the notes then outstanding. The indenture governing the notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities.\nThe notes are our obligations only and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries.\nThe notes are our obligations exclusively and are not guaranteed by any of our operating subsidiaries. A substantial portion of our consolidated assets is held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to service our debt, including the notes, depends on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise, to pay amounts due on our obligations, including the notes. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make payments on the notes or to make any funds available for that purpose. In addition, dividends, loans or other distributions to us from such subsidiaries may be subject to contractual, statutory and other restrictions and are subject to other business considerations.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. We will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes.\nHolders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of our then-existing indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nAccounting for convertible debt securities under GAAP is governed by Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional\npaid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We may report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 79477, "SIC": 6321, "TIC": "UAM"}
