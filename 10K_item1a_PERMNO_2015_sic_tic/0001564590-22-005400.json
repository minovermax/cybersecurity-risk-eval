The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.\n\u2022\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR as a permissible rate index in new contracts after 2021, the formal announcement of LIBOR\u2019s cessation date (June 30, 2023), and ongoing uncertainty related to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.\nRisks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory Environment\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.\n\u2022\nM&T\u2019s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on the results of supervisory stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve.\n\u2022\nIf an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (\u201cOLF\u201d).\nCredit Risk\n\u2022\nDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nLiquidity Risk\n\u2022\nThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.\n\u2022\nIf the Company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.\n\u2022\nM&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.\nStrategic Risk\n\u2022\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\n\u2022\nDifficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions and in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.\n\u2022\nM&T could suffer if the Company fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nOperational Risk\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security, including due to events beyond the Company\u2019s control.\n\u2022\nThe Company could incur higher costs, experience lower revenue, and suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft, loss or misuse of information, including due to a cyber security attack.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage.\n\u2022\nM&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure.\n\u2022\nThe Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nBusiness Risk\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.\n\u2022\nThe Company is exposed to reputational risk.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may not be effective.\n\u2022\nPandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s assets, communities, operations, reputation and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate risk\nRisk Factors\nM&T and its subsidiaries face a number of potential risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments and M&T\u2019s securities, including its common stock. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company. These risk factors include risks relating to M&T\u2019s acquisition of People\u2019s United pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated February 21, 2021, by and among M&T, Bridge Merger Corp., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of M&T, and People\u2019s United (the \u201cmerger agreement\u201d and, such transaction, the \u201cmerger\u201d).\nRisks Related to the Merger with People\u2019s United\nM&T is expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration.\nM&T has incurred and expects to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and closing the merger. In addition, M&T will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as M&T integrates the People\u2019s United business, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs.\nThere can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. M&T may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. M&T will also incur significant legal, financial advisory, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the merger is completed.\nCombining M&T and People\u2019s United may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and M&T may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of M&T and People\u2019s United. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger M&T and People\u2019s United must integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting revenues and future growth. If M&T and People\u2019s United are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of M&T following the completion of the merger, which may adversely affect the value of M&T\u2019s common stock following the completion of the merger.\nM&T and People\u2019s United have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies\u2019 abilities to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert\nmanagement attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on M&T during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger.\nM&T may be unable to retain M&T and/or People\u2019s United personnel successfully.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on M&T\u2019s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by M&T and People\u2019s United. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with M&T or People\u2019s United, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with M&T after the merger is completed. If M&T and People\u2019s United are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, M&T and People\u2019s United could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the merger, if key employees terminate their employment, M&T\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected, and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating M&T and People\u2019s United to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause M&T\u2019s business to suffer. In addition, M&T and People\u2019s United may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of M&T and People\u2019s United. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of M&T or People\u2019s United, or the business operations of M&T or People\u2019s United are further disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of M&T and People\u2019s United may also be delayed and adversely affected. Additional time may be required to obtain the requisite regulatory approval, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d) may impose additional requirements on M&T or People\u2019s United that must be satisfied prior to completion of the merger, which could delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.\nRegulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on M&T following the merger.\nBefore the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be completed, certain regulatory approvals must be obtained. Approvals from the New York State Department of Financial Services and the State of Connecticut Department of Banking, among other regulatory approvals, have been received but the transaction remains subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board. That approval could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to: an adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approval, including factors not known at the present time and factors that may arise in the future; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment generally. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that if material weaknesses are identified by examiners before a banking organization applies to engage in expansionary activity, the Federal Reserve Board will expect the banking organization to resolve all such weaknesses before applying for such expansionary activity. The Federal Reserve Board has also stated that if issues arise during the processing of an application for expansionary activity, it will expect the applicant banking organization to withdraw its application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns.\nAny Federal Reserve Board approval, if granted, may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of M&T\u2019s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that the regulator will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of M&T following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nIn addition, despite the parties\u2019 commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators, under the terms of the merger agreement, M&T will not be required, and People\u2019s United will not be permitted without M&T\u2019s prior written consent, to take actions or agree to conditions in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of governmental entities that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on M&T and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact M&T.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, there may be various adverse consequences and M&T may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. For example, M&T\u2019s business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of M&T common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price of M&T common stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be beneficial to M&T and will be completed. M&T could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against M&T to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, M&T may be required to pay a termination fee of $280 million to People\u2019s United.\nAdditionally, M&T has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, M&T would have incurred these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nM&T is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on M&T. These uncertainties may impair M&T\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with M&T to seek to change existing business relationships with M&T. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, M&T has agreed to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its ability to consummate the merger on a timely basis without People\u2019s United\u2019s consent. These restrictions may prevent M&T from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nLitigation related to the merger has been filed against People\u2019s United, the People\u2019s United board of directors and M&T, and additional litigation may be filed against People\u2019s United, the People\u2019s United board of directors, M&T and the M&T board of directors in the future, which could prevent or delay the completion of the merger, result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of M&T.\nLitigation related to the merger has been filed against People\u2019s United, the People\u2019s United board of directors and M&T, and additional litigation may be filed against People\u2019s United, the People\u2019s United board of directors, M&T and the M&T board of directors in the future. Among other remedies, litigation that has been filed seeks, and additional litigation by shareholders of M&T and/or stockholders of People\u2019s United in the future may seek damages and/or to enjoin the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting M&T or People\u2019s United from completing the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to M&T, including costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Further, such lawsuits and the defense or settlement of any such lawsuits may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of M&T.\nRisks Relating to COVID-19 Pandemic\nM&T\u2019s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruption to the U.S. and global economy and created significant volatility in the financial markets. The duration of this disruption and impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nThe pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines and other public health measures, the continued effectiveness of M&T\u2019s business continuity plans, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the Company\u2019s employees, customers, clients, counterparties, vendors, service providers and other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.\nAlthough economic and market conditions have generally improved during 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, including associated variants, has, at times, resulted in adverse economic and market conditions. Depending on the duration and severity of the pandemic on general economic and market conditions, consumer and corporate spending and investment and borrowing patterns, there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur, including the following:\n\u2022\nIncreased unemployment levels, interrupted income of consumers and decreased consumer confidence generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures;\n\u2022\nIncreased disruption to businesses, permanent or temporary closure of businesses and decreased business confidence generally, leading to increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and bankruptcies;\n\u2022\nAn initial sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets;\n\u2022\nA decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s net interest income and margin;\n\u2022\nHigher inflation and supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022\nDeclines in collateral values;\n\u2022\nIncreased demands on capital and liquidity;\n\u2022\nHeightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks to the Company, including as a result of remote work arrangements for employees and increased digital and mobile banking activities by customers;\n\u2022\nDisruptions to the business operations of the Company, including temporary branch closures and disruptions to branch and office openings, supply chains and employee travel and working arrangements; and\n\u2022\nDisruptions to business operations at counterparties, vendors and other service providers.\nThe pandemic is likely to continue to contribute to these risks and impacts and could affect geographic areas in which the Company operates differently as further noted herein under \u201cMarket Risk\u201d and \u201cCredit Risk.\u201d As a result, the Company\u2019s credit, liquidity, market, operational and other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides. In addition, the Company\u2019s business operations continue to be at risk of adverse disruption if significant portions of the Company\u2019s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt remote work arrangements or other effects of the pandemic, or if the Company is unable to keep branches or offices open, including because of risk of infection. The Company faces similar risks if its counterparties, vendors and other service providers are unable to maintain operations due to pandemic-related disruptions. The pandemic may also delay or adversely affect M&T\u2019s efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of the Company and People\u2019s United, if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of M&T or People\u2019s United or cause further disruption to the business operations of the Company or People\u2019s United.\nGovernmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of those measures is not yet entirely known and those measures, or additional measures that may be introduced, may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. If such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s borrowers, the Company may also experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods. The Company also faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. Furthermore, various government programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program are complex and the Company\u2019s participation may lead to litigation and governmental, regulatory and third party scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to its reputation.\nThe length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown. It is unknown when there will be a return to normal business activity and a subsiding of the economic stress associated with the pandemic. Prolonged continuation of the pandemic could worsen these risks and impacts. Until the pandemic subsides, the Company may experience reduced revenues in certain of its fee-related businesses and increased customer and client defaults, including defaults in unsecured loans. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession, and M&T anticipates the Company\u2019s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and M&T\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company\u2019s business and operations following the completion of the merger with People\u2019s United.\nMarket Risk\nWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.\nPoor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business including:\n\u2022\nA decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.\n\u2022\nA decrease in net interest income derived from the Company\u2019s lending and deposit gathering activities.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the value of the Company\u2019s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate.\n\u2022\nA decrease in fees from the Company\u2019s brokerage, trust, and investment management businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices.\n\u2022\nPotential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels.\n\u2022\nAn impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.\n\u2022\nAn increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses as well as impairment write-downs of certain investment securities and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.\nVolatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s borrowers or result in lower values for the Company\u2019s investment securities and other interest-earning assets.\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.\nAs a result of the high percentage of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, including in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, as well as changes linked to inflation, can have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business and profitability and the value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities.\nFor example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may:\n\u2022\nAffect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company\u2019s overall net interest income and profitability.\n\u2022\nAdversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the Company\u2019s loss rates on those assets.\n\u2022\nDecrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits.\n\u2022\nAffect the Company\u2019s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.\n\u2022\nAffect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company\u2019s cost of such funding.\nIn addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management\u2019s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company\u2019s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR as a permissible rate index in new contracts after 2021, the formal announcement of LIBOR\u2019s cessation date (June 30, 2023), and ongoing uncertainty related to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or to an alternative index, currency, basket or other financial metric.\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intended to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement created market uncertainty as to whether and to what extent panel banks would continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and as to the continued existence of LIBOR after 2021. The uncertainty lessened in November 2020, when (i) public statements issued by the ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, and the FCA, announced a proposal to, among other things, extend the publication of the most commonly utilized tenors of USD LIBOR until June 30, 2023, and (ii) a joint-statement of the federal bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, indicated support for the IBA proposal and encouraged banks to (a) transition away from USD LIBOR as soon as practicable, (b) cease (with limited exceptions) entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and no later than December 31, 2021, and (c) for new contracts entered into before December 31, 2021, either utilize a reference rate other than USD LIBOR or include robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after USD LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation, noting that failure to do so would create safety and soundness risks. On March 5, 2021, public statements by the FCA and IBA confirmed the future cessation (or non-representativeness) of all USD LIBOR tenors, and specifically, the June 30, 2023 cessation date for the most commonly utilized USD LIBOR tenors, after which USD LIBOR will either no longer exist or no longer be representative of the underlying market it is intended to measure.\nFollowing the initial FCA announcement in 2017, regulators and various financial industry groups sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cAARC\u201d)) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish recommended practices for transitioning the market away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). In 2020, the ARRC finalized and issued recommendations for the use of so-called \u201chardwired\u201d LIBOR fallback language that, when incorporated into existing LIBOR-based loan documents, provides for, upon LIBOR\u2019s permanent cessation (or an announcement from LIBOR\u2019s administrator or certain governmental authorities that LIBOR is no longer representative of the underlying market), the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as the benchmark index, with an appropriate spread adjustment that is representative of the historical difference between LIBOR and SOFR, which when added to SOFR would be intended to facilitate a value-neutral transition. In April 2021, M&T adopted hardwired fallback language modeled after the ARRC recommendations for use in all new LIBOR loans.\nSOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based repurchase transactions. The fact that SOFR is a secured overnight rate and considered a \u201crisk free\u201d rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured term rate that factors in credit risk, means that SOFR may perform differently than LIBOR, and those differences may be material, particularly in times of economic stress, negatively impacting the Company\u2019s profitability.\nOver the past few years, the AARC\u2019s recommendations and proposals have evolved, and the Company has continued to monitor both ARRC and general market developments. While the ARRC has maintained its recommendation that SOFR is the preferred replacement for LIBOR, some industry participants are questioning whether a \u201crisk free\u201d SOFR rate is an ideal replacement for LIBOR in the commercial lending market and suggesting that a credit-sensitive component or alternative be considered and developed. One such credit sensitive alternative is the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), which gained some increased attention and use in the business loan market in the latter half of 2021. Whether BSBY or other alternatives develop and gain any significant traction in the market are unknown and unpredictable at this time, and this adds\nfurther uncertainty to the LIBOR transition process, both with respect to amending existing LIBOR contracts and pricing new contracts based on SOFR or an alternative reference rate going forward.\nLIBOR cessation is also impacting the derivatives market. In October 2020, The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), published the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (Supplement) and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (Protocol). The Supplement, which became effective on January 25, 2021, amends existing standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate robust fallbacks to the SOFR benchmark for derivatives linked to LIBOR. The Protocol enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the Protocol. The fallbacks apply following a permanent cessation of LIBOR or following a determination by the FCA that LIBOR is no longer representative of the underlying market. M&T and M&T Bank adhered to the Protocol on November 5, 2020, and the Company is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap hedging transactions with its end user customers, i.e., borrowers who have hedged their interest rate payment obligations. If the Company is not able to agree to appropriate LIBOR fallbacks with these customers, there will be uncertainty as to how to value and effect the Company\u2019s rights and obligations under legacy derivatives contracts. With respect to the Company\u2019s cleared interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR, both the CME and LCH clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant SOFR benchmark fallbacks of the Supplement and Protocol which also became effective on January 25, 2021.\nThe Company has outstanding issuances, or acts as an administrative (or calculation) agent or in other capacities, across various maturities of securities referencing LIBOR in which the underlying contracts do not contemplate cessation or contemplate cessation but do so in a manner that may create other risks (\u201cTough Legacy Contracts\u201d). Some of these contracts provide for selecting replacement rates in a manner that presents significant challenges or that gives the Company or another party discretion to select a rate or provide for determination of a reference rate. In April 2021, the New York State legislature passed Senate Bill 297B/Assembly Bill 164B which allows certain New York State law governed Tough Legacy Contracts to transition to SOFR, as the statutory benchmark replacement rate, by operation of law. Similarly, the United States Congress is currently considering the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021 (H.R. 4616) which, if enacted, would have an analogous effect on the transition of Tough Legacy Contracts, but would expand the applicability beyond the State of New York to contracts governed by the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States. Notwithstanding the availability or potential availability of statutory frameworks to address Tough Legacy Contracts, there will likely be continued uncertainty surrounding the transition as these frameworks have not been tested and their effectiveness and ultimate impact is not certain.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to the Company\u2019s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company\u2019s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2023) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. Uncertainty as to the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR, the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative index, and the operational feasibility of amending existing contracts referencing LIBOR to include hardwired LIBOR fallback language referencing a new replacement index could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.\nThe market\u2019s transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will be complex and unpredictable, giving rise to a variety of risks, including operational risks, risks of value transfer\nbetween contract parties, the potential for customer disputes and litigation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, as the most recent regulatory announcements indicate that there will be increased regulatory focus on LIBOR transition in 2022 and beyond. The Company established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program in 2019, which now includes a LIBOR Transition Office with senior management level leadership and dedicated full-time employee staffing. An impact assessment has been completed to identify on- and off-balance sheet exposures, systems, processes, models, customers, and employees affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products and contracts associated with LIBOR to alternative reference rates.\nThe Company\u2019s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.\nAs most of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company\u2019s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may:\n\u2022\nAffect the value or liquidity of the Company\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.\n\u2022\nAffect the value of capitalized servicing assets.\n\u2022\nAffect M&T\u2019s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\n\u2022\nAffect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company\u2019s services.\n\u2022\nImpact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.\nVolatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, as well as elevated inflation, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.\nThe Company\u2019s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company\u2019s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The credit quality of the Company\u2019s borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside the Company\u2019s control, including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuations. The trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, have caused, and in the future may cause, the Company to experience impairment charges, which are drastic reductions\nin the recoverable value of an asset, increased purchase demands, wherein customers make withdrawals with minimum notice, higher costs (e.g., servicing, foreclosure, property maintenance), additional write-downs and losses and a potential impact to engage in lending transactions based on a reduction of customer deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory Environment\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors and the financial system as a whole, not securities holders, including the holders of common stock. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company\u2019s sale and lending practices, capital structure, capital distributions and dividend policy, investment practices, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, or to meet supervisory expectations, could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or admissions of wrongdoing as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company\u2019s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company\u2019s activities. A prior enforcement action also increases the risk that regulators and governmental authorities pursue formal enforcement actions in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation, even if unrelated to the prior enforcement action.\nAny new regulatory requirements, changes to existing requirements, or changes to interpretations of requirements could require changes to the Company\u2019s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory scrutiny, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent years, and additional proposed changes are anticipated. Many of these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. For more information on the regulations to which the Company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1 - Business in this report.\nM&T may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.\nBank holding companies, including M&T, are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules. For additional information, see \u201cCapital Requirements\u201d under Part I, Item 1 - Business.\nRegulators have and may, from time to time, implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. In addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve\u2019s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the Company\u2019s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective, which could adversely affect its net interest income and net interest margin.\nThe federal bank regulators have not yet released a proposal to implement the significant revisions of the Basel capital framework announced by the Basel Committee in December 2017, and the impact on the Company of these revisions will depend on the manner in which they are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as M&T.\nM&T\u2019s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on the results of supervisory stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve.\nAny decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T\u2019s Board of Directors and must comply with applicable capital regulations, including the maintenance of capital ratios exceeding specified minimum levels and applicable buffers.\nFor bank holding companies designated as Category IV institutions under the Tailoring Rules, including M&T, the Federal Reserve conducts biennial supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby the BHC\u2019s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. The results of those stress tests are incorporated in the determination of M&T\u2019s Stress Capital Buffer. As a general matter, if M&T is unable to maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimum levels inclusive of its Stress Capital Buffer, it would be subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing stock. In August 2021, the Federal Reserve Board provided M&T with a Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5%, representing the floor under the regulatory capital rules, which became applicable to M&T on October 1, 2021. The results of future supervisory stress tests are uncertain, and a more severe outcome may result in a higher Stress Capital Buffer and an increase in M&T\u2019s effective capital requirements. An increased Stress Capital Buffer may restrict M&T\u2019s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T.\nIn addition, during 2020 and the first half of 2021, the Federal Reserve implemented measures requiring all large bank holding companies to preserve capital through limitations on share repurchase programs and common stock dividends. While these restrictions are no longer applicable, the Federal Reserve may implement similar restrictions in the future, including in response to adverse or uncertain economic conditions. Also, if, as in June 2020, the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan, the Company generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.\nIf an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (\u201cOLF\u201d).\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC\u2019s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit Risk\nDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.\nAs a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans and other obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans and obligations may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and entering into other financial arrangements.\nFactors that influence the Company\u2019s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company\u2019s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company\u2019s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, including in the New York City area; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company\u2019s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. The Company\u2019s credit risk and the performance of its lending portfolios may be affected by concentration in an industry, geography or asset type. Also, as described further in the risk factor above, the Company\u2019s credit risks have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides. The pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, customers, including businesses in the hotel and travel industry.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support its customers, the Company offered (primarily in 2020, but also in 2021) payment deferrals and other expanded assistance to businesses and consumers, and committed in certain states in which it operates to suspend residential mortgage payments and foreclosure sales for financially impacted customers for certain periods of time. A significant number of the Company\u2019s customers sought to suspend their mortgage payments under these programs. Suspensions of mortgage payments and foreclosures and reduced pricing under these programs may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and results of operations. In addition, if these programs are not effective in mitigating the financial consequences of COVID-19 on customers, or if customers are unable to pay their loans after these programs expire, the Company may experience\nhigher rates of default, increased credit losses and additional increases to the allowance for credit losses in future periods.\nCommercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Emerging and evolving factors such as the shift to work-from-home arrangements, changing consumer preferences (including for online shopping), COVID-19-related restrictions and resulting changes in occupancy rates as a result of these and other trends can also impact such valuations over relatively short periods. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers, including as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management\u2019s judgment, the amount of losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management\u2019s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 appropriately reflects expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover all credit losses that may occur.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to or derivative exposure of the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.\nThe Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as the debt and equity capital markets.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general,\nwhich may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company\u2019s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company\u2019s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T\u2019s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.\nRegulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and competitive position. Various regulations have been adopted to impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Company. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing and minimum liquidity requirements. The application of certain of these regulations to banking organizations, such as the Company, have been modified, including in connection with the implementation of the tailoring rules in the EGRRCPA. While marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to the Company (such as relief from LCR compliance), overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.\nIf the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company\u2019s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The Company may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.\nThe total amount that the Company pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or grow its deposits. If the Company is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company\u2019s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Customers may also move noninterest-bearing deposits to interest bearing accounts, increasing the cost of those deposits. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. The Company\u2019s bank customers could withdraw their money and put it in alternative investments, causing the Company to lose a lower cost source of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce the Company\u2019s net interest margin and net interest income.\nM&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.\nM&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are M&T\u2019s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T\u2019s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See \u201cItem 1 - Business, Supervision and Regulation of the Company, Distributions\u201d for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors. Limitations on M&T\u2019s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.\nStrategic Risk\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nThe financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms, financial technology companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company\u2019s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments have and could continue to result in the Company\u2019s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company has and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share.\nFinally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC\u2019s fintech charter. As a result, the Company has had and will likely continue to have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new\ntechnology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers.\nDifficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions and in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.\nM&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. The Company\u2019s ability to complete acquisitions is in many instances subject to regulatory approval, and the Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals would be granted. Any requisite approval could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to, among other factors, an adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approval, including factors not known at the time of entering into the definitive agreement for the acquisition or submission of the related application for regulatory approval, and factors that may arise subsequently; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment more generally.\nIn addition, inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nInability to fully achieve the Company\u2019s strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition.\n\u2022\nIssues arising during transition and integration.\n\u2022\nDisruption of the Company\u2019s business and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention.\n\u2022\nExposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions.\n\u2022\nLoss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions.\n\u2022\nDilution in the ownership percentage of holders of M&T common stock.\n\u2022\nPayment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company\u2019s tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term.\n\u2022\nInability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity).\n\u2022\nChanges in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities.\nM&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nM&T\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company\u2019s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. The increase in remote work arrangements and opportunities in regional, national and global labor markets has also increased competition for the Company to attract and retain skilled personnel. The Company\u2019s current or future approach to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by other companies, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability\nto attract and retain employees. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company\u2019s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.\nOperational Risk\nThe Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.\nLike all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error or misconduct, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud by employees or persons outside the company, and breaches in data security. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company\u2019s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or foregone business opportunities.\nAs described further in the risk factor herein, the Company\u2019s operational risks have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security, including due to events beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s customer relationships. Disruption of operating systems caused by events beyond the Company\u2019s control may include computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, quality of vulnerability patches, cyber security attacks (including Distributed Denial of Service attacks, which occur when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor), damage to property or physical assets, or events arising from political protests or terrorist acts. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect\nof these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, disruption, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.\nInformation security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as digital and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber security attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been numerous instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors, or the freezing of operating systems and databases making them inaccessible or unusable. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to, or the usage of, operating systems and databases. Ransomware is a form of malicious software, known as \u201cmalware,\u201d designed to block access to, and often encrypt, computer systems or data. Once the victim\u2019s computer system or data is locked down and encrypted, rendering it essentially useless, the malicious cyber actor then extorts the victim by demanding a ransom payment in exchange for providing a method to decrypt it. The attacker may also copy the victim\u2019s data in the course of the attack and threaten to sell or publish the data if the ransom is not paid. Ransomware attacks can result in a loss of business functionality and of sensitive data.\nAs cyber security threats continue to evolve, the Company expects to continue to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber security criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.\nFurther, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company\u2019s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company\u2019s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Company\u2019s customers, or systems breakdowns, failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company\u2019s operational costs and adversely affecting its business. Additionally, successful cyber security attacks at other large financial institutions, whether or not the Company is impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect M&T, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of the Company\u2019s financial products. Though the Company has insurance against some cyber security risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nThe Company, as well as third parties with which the Company does business, has expanded the use of cloud service providers, which providers could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber security-attacks, negative changes to financial condition, bankruptcy, or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation. Thus, increasing the amount of infrastructure that the Company or its vendors and service providers outsource to the cloud or to other parties may increase M&T\u2019s risk exposure. The failure to properly upgrade or maintain the computer systems could result in greater susceptibility to attacks,\nparticularly in light of the greater frequency and severity of attacks in recent years, as well as the growing prevalence of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Failures related to upgrades and maintenance also increase risks related to unauthorized access and misuse, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its business continuity and resiliency objectives.\nThe Company could incur higher costs, experience lower revenue, and suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft, loss or misuse of information, including due to a cyber security attack.\nLike other financial services firms, the systems, networks and devices of the Company, its customers, employees, service providers or other third parties with whom the Company interacts continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering, and cyber security attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, eliminate access or cause other damage. These threats may arise from human error, fraud on the part of employees, insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technology failure or vulnerabilities of suppliers through supply chain attacks. Further, cyber security and information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased because of, among other things, the growth of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including computers, smartphones, and other mobile devices outside the Company\u2019s systems) by customers to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, fraudsters, hackers, terrorists, activists, instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties.\nAlthough the Company believes that a robust suite of authentication and layered security controls, data encryption and tokenization, threat intelligence, anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management tools exist, the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Further, as the Company expands its mobile and digital capabilities, cyber security risks increase.\nA disruption or breach, including as a result of a cyber security attack, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at the Company or at third-party service providers, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, damage to reputation or loss of confidence in the security of systems, products and services that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Like other U.S. financial services providers, M&T continues to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cyber security threats from sophisticated third parties. Although the Company is not aware of any material losses relating to cyber security incidents, there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber security incidents will not become known or occur or that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage\nThe Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. New customer privacy initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on the Company, may limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data. Significant examples include the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions for breach of such laws and regulations.\nAs privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, they may also limit how companies like M&T can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such\ndata. The time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.\nM&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company\u2019s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.\nAdditionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to the Company\u2019s third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the Company. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors\u2019 use of common service providers.\nThe Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nMany aspects of the Company\u2019s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries\u2019 business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk with respect to its obligations to indemnify directors and officers of it and its subsidiaries in connection with certain legal matters as well as in situations where it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company\u2019s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued\nfor legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMany financial institutions, including the Company, have received inquiries from the United States Congress, regulators and other government authorities regarding implementation of provisions and programs under the CARES Act, and may also face the risk of litigation concerning their participation in the PPP under that Act. The Company\u2019s involvement in these and other programs created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to additional government and regulatory inquiries and litigation in the future, any of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness Risk\nChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company\u2019s prior period financial statements. Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 27 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T\u2019s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company\u2019s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company\u2019s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d and Note 1, \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies,\u201d of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nThe Company\u2019s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.\nThe Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values, among other uses. The Company uses models throughout many of its business lines, relying on them, along with its judgement, for many decision making processes. Examples of areas where the Company uses models include determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels. The Company also uses models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Models generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions, relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macro-economic conditions, in order to generate the output. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models, including in the choice of relevant historical data or future-looking assumptions, present the risk that the Company\u2019s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. Even if the underlying assumptions used in the Company\u2019s models are adequate, the models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model\u2019s design. As a result, the Company\u2019s models may not fully capture or express the risks the Company faces, may suggest that the Company has sufficient capital when it may not, or may lead the Company to misjudge the business and economic environment in which it operates. If the models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, the Company may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Furthermore, strategies that the Company employs to manage and govern the risks associated with its use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, the Company may realize losses or other lapses. Finally, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that the Company\u2019s regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to M&T\u2019s stockholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nThe Company is exposed to reputational risk.\nA negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company\u2019s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company\u2019s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the Company\u2019s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. A service disruption of the Company\u2019s technology platforms or an impact to the Company\u2019s branches could have a negative impact on a customer\u2019s access to banking services, and harm the Company\u2019s reputation with customers. In particular, a cyber security event impacting the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 data could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cyber security. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.\nAdditionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may not be effective.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework\u2019s underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. There are inherent limitations to the Company\u2019s risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Company relies on both qualitative and quantitative factors, including models, to monitor, measure and analyze certain risks and to estimate certain financial values, which are subject to error. The Company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees, as well as manage risks associated with third parties, and could fail to do so effectively. If the Company\u2019s risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nPandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nPandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events, including severe weather and other natural disasters, could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s assets, communities, operations, reputation and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate risk.\nThe Company operates in regions where its businesses and the activities of its customers could be negatively impacted by climate risk.\nThis includes the physical risks resulting from chronic shifts in climate, such as rising average global temperatures and rising sea levels, and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados. Such chronic shifts and events could damage or otherwise impact the value or productivity of customers\u2019 assets and disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and the operations of customers or third parties on which the Company relies. They could also result in market volatility, negatively impact the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 ability to repay outstanding loans, and damage or deteriorate the value of collateral. Over time such risks may result in both increasing premiums for and reduced availability of insurance and have a broader impact on the economy.\nFurther, climate risk may manifest from efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks may arise from changes in consumer and business preferences, legislation, regulation, policy, and technological advancement associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change. Such risks may result in increased expenses or otherwise adversely impact the Company and its customers, including the ability of customers to repay outstanding loans. The Company could experience increased expenses resulting from climate-related strategic planning and market changes, as well as litigation and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to its climate change strategy and responses. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding appropriate climate risk management and practices may also result in higher regulatory, compliance and other expenses.\nDiscussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness,\u201d and Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.\nIn addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.", "PERMNO": 35554, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MTB"}
