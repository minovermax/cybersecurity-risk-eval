RISK FACTORS\nThere are numerous risks affecting our business, some of which are beyond our control. An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and may not be appropriate for investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In addition to the risks outlined below, risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our operating results and financial condition include, without limitation, the following:\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS\nWe have experienced losses since our founding. A failure to obtain profitability and achieve consistent positive cash flows would have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception, including a reported net loss of $6,414,230 and $4,223,467 for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was $3,354,898. In fiscal 2014, we used $2,900,870 of cash in our operating activities. We expect to continue to incur operating losses through at least fiscal 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $29,987,131, cash and cash equivalents of $8,295,310, working capital of $5,059,800 and stockholders\u2019 equity of $3,757,069. To date, we have funded our operations principally through the sale of our capital stock and debt instruments, as well as contributions of capital to our predecessor, and cash generated from operations. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we cannot assure you that we will ever realize revenues at such levels. If we do achieve profitability in any period, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe may require additional financing to support our operations. Such financing may only be available on disadvantageous terms, or may not be available at all. Any new equity financing could have a substantial dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8,295,310, working capital of $5,059,800 and an accumulated deficit of $29,987,131. While we closed a $10.6 million underwritten public offering on November 18, 2015, our cash position may decline in the future, and we may not be successful in maintaining an adequate level of cash resources. Our key vendors have accommodated us by extending payment terms for our outstanding accounts payables, but we cannot assure you that these accommodations will continue. If our key vendors begin demanding standard payment terms, we may not be able to pay our accounts payable in a timely fashion, and we may lose our relationships with our key vendors.\nWe may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to support our growing operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, and any new equity financing could have a substantial dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain additional financing, we will not be able to achieve the sales growth that we need to cover our costs, and our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nWe cannot predict our future results because we have a limited operating history.\nOur predecessor, which began our business, was formed in January 2005. We began realizing revenues from operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. Given our limited operating history, it may be difficult for you to evaluate our performance or prospects. You should consider the uncertainties that we may encounter as a company that should still be considered an early stage company. These uncertainties include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to market and sell the COPsync Network and other products for a profit;\n\u00b7\nour ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u00b7\nour evolving business model.\nIf we are not able to address successfully some or all of these uncertainties, we may not be able to expand our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.\nIf we are unable to develop and generate additional demand for our services or products, we will likely suffer serious harm to our business.\nWe have invested significant resources in developing and marketing our services and products. The demand for, and market acceptance of, our services and products is subject to a high level of uncertainty. Adoption of new software and hardware solutions, particularly by law enforcement agencies, which have historically relied upon more traditional means of communication, requires a broad acceptance of substantially different methods of conducting business and collecting and sharing information. Our services and products are often considered complex and often involve a new approach to the conduct of business by our customers. As a result, intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our services and products in order to generate additional demand. The market for our services and products may weaken, competitors may develop superior offerings or we may fail to develop acceptable solutions to address new market conditions. Any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe rely predominantly on sales to governmental entities, and the loss of a significant number of our contracts would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of local governments. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully sell our products to such governmental entity. In order to sell to government entities, we may be required to obtain approval and/or certification by such government entities, and may require the maintenance of certain security clearances for facilities and employees, which can entail administrative time and effort possibly resulting in additional costs and delays. Additionally, such approval and/or certification processes may change, or more stringent processes may be developed, which may restrict our ability to continue to sell to government entities. Further, our sales, and results of operations, may be adversely affected by the curtailment of these governmental agencies\u2019 use of technology, including curtailment due to governmental budget reductions. Governmental budgets available to purchase our software services and products could be negatively affected by several factors, including events we cannot foresee, such as local government budget shortfalls, federal and state government budget limitations resulting in the curtailment of grant programs that would otherwise cover the purchase of our services, current or future economic conditions, a change in spending priorities, and other related exigencies and contingencies. A significant decline in or redirection of local law enforcement expenditures in the future could result in a decrease to our sales, earnings and cash flows.\nUndetected errors or failures in our software could result in loss or delay in the market acceptance for our products or lost sales.\nBecause our software services and products, and the environments in which they operate, are complex, our software and products may contain errors that can be detected at any point in its lifecycle. While we continually test our services and products for errors, errors may be found at any time in the future. Detection of any significant errors may result in, among other things, loss of, or delay in, market acceptance and sales of our services and products, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, increased service and warranty costs, license terminations or renegotiations or costly litigation. Additionally, because our services and products support or rely on other systems and applications, any software or hardware errors or bugs in these systems or applications may result in errors in the performance of our service or products, and it may be difficult or impossible to determine where the error resides.\nWe may not be competitive, and increased competition could seriously harm our business.\nRelative to us, some of our current competitors or potential competitors of our COPsync 911 threat alert service, COURTsync service or VidTac in-vehicle video system may have one or more of the following advantages:\n\u00b7\nlonger operating histories;\n\u00b7\ngreater financial, technical, marketing, sales and other resources;\n\u00b7\npositive cash flows from operations;\n\u00b7\ngreater name recognition;\n\u00b7\na broader range of products to offer;\n\u00b7\na larger installed base of customers; and\n\u00b7\ncompetitive product pricing.\nAlthough no single competitive factor is dominant, current and potential competitors of our COPsync 911 threat alert service, COURTsync service or VidTac in-vehicle video system may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their offerings that are competitive with our products and services, which may result in increased competition. Although to date we have not identified any direct competitors for our COPsync Network, competitors may develop in the future and such competitors may have greater resources or name recognition than we currently enjoy. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors.\nSales to most of our target customers involve long sales and implementation cycles, which may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly.\nWe sell our services and products primarily to local government agencies and school districts. A prospective customer\u2019s decision to purchase our services or products may often involve lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. Throughout the sales cycle, we anticipate often spending considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our services and products. Budget constraints and the need for multiple approvals within these organizations may also delay the purchase decision. Failure to obtain the timely required approval for a particular project or purchase decision may delay the purchase of our services or products. As a result, we expect that the sales cycle for our services and products will typically exceed 180 days, depending on the availability of funding to the prospective customer. These long cycles may cause delays in any potential sale, and we may spend a large amount of time and resources on prospective customers who decide not to purchase our services or products, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, many of our services and products are designed for the law enforcement community, which requires us to maintain a sales force that understands the needs of this profession, engages in extensive negotiations and provides high-level support to complete sales. If we do not successfully market our services and products to these targeted customers, our operating results will be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur products, offerings and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of criminal justice information, including law enforcement telemetry data, non-adjudicated criminal justice information and other personally identifiable information that our various products and systems collect, process, summarize and report. The integrity and protection of our data is critical to our business and our customers have the expectation that we will adequately protect this information. The federal Criminal Justice Information Security (CJIS) Policy and additional requirements imposed on us by the law enforcement industry pertaining to information security and privacy are increasingly demanding and continue to evolve. Maintaining compliance with these requirements may increase our operating costs and adversely impact our ability to release new products and services to our customers. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of our data, which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits. Our business could be subject to significant disruption, and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm, in the event of such incidents and claims.\nWe will not be able to develop or continue our business if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain a number of highly skilled employees and on the service and performance of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. Competition for qualified personnel possessing the skills necessary to implement our strategy is intense, and we may fail to attract or retain the employees necessary to execute our business model successfully. We have obtained \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies covering two of our employees.\nOur success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering and other personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. In particular, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on Ronald A. Woessner, our chief executive officer, Russell Chaney, our founder and a member of the board, and Shane Rapp, our founder and president. If Messrs. Woessner, Chaney or Rapp, or any other key members of our management team, leave our employment, our business could suffer and the share price of our common stock and warrants would likely decline. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with each of Messrs. Chaney and Rapp, either of them may voluntarily terminate his services at any time. We do not currently have an employment agreement with Mr. Woessner and do not expect to enter into such agreement.\nFurthermore, our sales success is dependent on our sales leadership and our sales representatives. We continue to experience turnover in our sales organization, including at the executive level. Our current senior sales executive is relatively new to the company. In 2014 and 2015, we hired new sales personnel to fill various vacancies and increased the size of our sales team. Our current sales team is less experienced in the law enforcement space than our previous sales team. Consequently, our sales volumes could suffer until our new sales personnel become fully integrated.\nIf we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology, our financial results could be harmed.\nMost of our software and underlying technology is proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a cost-effective manner.\nThird parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products and services.\nFrom time to time, we might receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may incur significant expenditures to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.\nIn addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third party software, could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe federal trademark \u201cCOPSYNC\u201d is held by a third party. If the third party were to assert a trademark infringement claim against us, we could incur substantial costs and expenses in defending the claim and could be forced to relinquish our use of the \u201cCOPSYNC\u201d mark and adopt a different trademark. This could cause a loss of the goodwill we have accumulated with respect to the sales of our products and services using the \u201cCOPSYNC\u201d mark and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe may become involved in litigation which could harm the value of our business.\nBecause of the nature of our business, there is a risk of litigation from customers, suppliers, employees, partners, stockholders and others. Litigation can cause us to incur substantial expenses whether or not we prevail, which will add to our costs and may affect the capital available for our operations. An increase in our costs may cause us to increase the prices we charge for our products and services, which may lead our customers to seek alternatives to our products. In such event, our revenues will decrease and we may be forced to curtail our operations.\nPeriods of sustained economic adversity and uncertainty could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDemand for our services and products depend in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures by many of our customers. Economic downturns result in lower tax receipts for municipalities, counties and school districts, hence, lower budgets for our customers and potential customers. Lower budgets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services and products, and our business, results of operations, cash flow and overall financial condition would suffer.\nDisruptions in the financial markets, such as what occurred in 2008, may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit for our potential customers, which could result in the delay or cancellation of customer purchases. In addition, the disruptions in the financial markets may have an adverse impact on regional and world economies and credit markets, which could negatively impact the availability and cost of capital for us and our customers. These conditions may reduce the willingness or ability of our customers and prospective customers to commit funds to purchase our services or products, or their ability to pay for our services after purchase. These conditions could result in bankruptcy or insolvency for some customers, which would impact our revenue and cash collections. These conditions could also result in pricing pressure and less favorable financial terms in our contracts and our ability to access capital to fund our operations.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe have a substantial number of authorized common and preferred shares available for future issuance that could cause dilution of our stockholders\u2019 interest and adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock.\nWe have a total of 50,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance. As of December 31, 2015, we had 41,637,097 shares of common stock and 900,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance. As of December 31, 2015, we had reserved 4,817,198 shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, 2,000 shares of our common stock for issuance upon conversion of outstanding shares of our preferred stock, 2,728 shares of our common stock upon conversion of an outstanding convertible note, 260,206 shares of our common stock to be issued for a series of conversions involving Series B Preferred Stock and Notes Payable, as well as stock grants issued to third-party service providers. Additionally, we have 157,900 additional shares available for future grants under our stock incentive plan. We may seek financing that could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock. We may also undertake acquisitions that result in issuances of additional shares of our capital stock. Those additional issuances of capital stock would result in a significant reduction of your percentage interest in us. Furthermore, the book value per share of our common stock may be reduced. This reduction would occur if the exercise price of any issued warrants, the conversion price of any convertible notes or the conversion ratio of any issued preferred stock is lower than the book value per share of our common stock at the time of such exercise or conversion.\nThe addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or by the registration of any of our other securities under the Securities Act may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. The future sales of shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and options may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock, as such warrants and options would be more likely to be exercised at a time when the price of our common stock is greater than the exercise price.\nThere may not be an active market for shares of our common stock, and we can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to meet NASDAQ listing requirements, which may cause our shares to trade at a discount and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCOYN.\u201d However, no assurance can be given that an active trading market for our common stock will develop and continue. As a result, you may find it more difficult to purchase, dispose of and obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our common stock and warrants.\nIf we are unable to continue to meet NASDAQ listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market. If our common stock were to be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock could continue to trade on the OTCQB or similar marketplace following any delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market. Any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nOur stock could be subject to volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new strategies, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other material developments that may affect our prospects;\n\u00b7\nshortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by company management;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of our key personnel;\n\u00b7\nsales of our capital stock in the future;\n\u00b7\nliquidity or cash flow constraints; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volume, which are particularly common for the securities of emerging technology companies, such as us.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock. We may pay dividends in the future at the discretion of our board of directors. We are restricted from paying dividends on our common stock unless a dividend is paid on our Series A Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the amount of the dividends for all shares of our common stock into which each such share of Series A Preferred Stock could then be converted. We are unlikely to pay dividends at any time in the foreseeable future; rather, we are likely to retain earnings, if any, to fund our operations and to develop and expand our business.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, our stockholders may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15834, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "COYNQ"}
