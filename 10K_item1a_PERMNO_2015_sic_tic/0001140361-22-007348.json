and\n\u25cf\nthe limited experience of our management team managing a public company, including a \u201clarge accelerated filer.\u201d\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe may require additional capital in the future and we cannot give any assurance that such capital will be available at all or available on terms acceptable to us and, if it is available, additional capital raised by us may dilute holders of Class A common stock.\nWe may need to raise funds in the future, depending on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour sales growth;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of applying our existing technologies to new or enhanced products;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of developing new technologies and introducing new products;\n\u25cf\nthe costs associated with protecting our intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nthe costs associated with our expansion, including capital expenditures and Lingang-related land purchases and deposits, and with increasing our sales and marketing and service and support efforts, and with expanding our geographic operations;\n\u25cf\nour ability to continue to obtain governmental subsidies for developmental projects in the future;\n\u25cf\nfuture debt repayment obligations; and\n\u25cf\nthe number and timing of any future acquisitions.\nTo the extent that our existing sources of cash, together with any cash generated from operations, are insufficient to fund our activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funding is not available, we may be required to reduce expenditures, including curtailing our growth strategies and reducing our product development efforts, or to forego acquisition opportunities.\nProceeds received by ACM Shanghai from the initial placements of shares with PRC investors and from STAR IPO, in connection with the STAR Listing, of ACM Shanghai shares on the STAR Market will be used to grow and support our PRC operations. Those proceeds generally are not available for distribution to ACM Research. Under existing PRC laws and regulations, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for ACM Research to be able to receive dividends comprised of funds generated by ACM Shanghai and, even if such dividends can be paid from the PRC to the United States, any such dividends can be paid to ACM Research only if other holders of ACM Shanghai shares receive their pro rata dividends. As a result, it is unlikely that funds raised or generated by ACM Shanghai will be readily distributable to ACM Research.\nIf we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. Furthermore, the holders of these new securities or debt may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of Class A common stock. In addition, any preferred equity issuance or debt financing that we may obtain in the future could have restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.\nOur quarterly operating results can be difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially, which could result in volatility in the price of Class A common stock.\nOur quarterly revenue and other operating results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance. Any variations in our quarter-to-quarter performance may cause our stock price to fluctuate. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the related impact on the purchase of equipment used in the manufacture of chips;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of purchases of our tools by chip fabricators, which order types of tools based on multi-year capital plans under which the number and dollar amount of tool purchases can vary significantly from year to year;\n\u25cf\nthe relatively high average selling price of our tools and our dependence on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue in any period, whereby the timing and volume of purchase orders or cancellations from our customers could significantly reduce our revenue for that period;\n\u25cf\nthe significant expenditures required to customize our products often exceed the deposits received from our customers;\n\u25cf\nthe lead time required to manufacture our tools;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of recognizing revenue due to the timing of shipment and acceptance of our tools;\n\u25cf\nour ability to sell additional tools to existing customers;\n\u25cf\nthe changes in customer specifications or requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe length of our product sales cycle;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our product mix, including the mix of systems, upgrades, spare parts and service;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of our product releases or upgrades or announcements of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors, including changes in customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements;\n\u25cf\nour ability to enhance our tools with new and better functionality that meet customer requirements and changing industry trends;\n\u25cf\nconstraints on our suppliers\u2019 capacity;\n\u25cf\nour ability to sell our tools to Chinese customers due to regulatory restrictions, including the addition of our customers to the Entity List;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of other suppliers to provide sufficient quantities of their tools to our Chinese customers which may indirectly the production plans of our customers and result in a reduction of demand for our tools;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of investments in research and development related to releasing new applications of our technologies and new products;\n\u25cf\ndelays in the development and manufacture of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and the market acceptance of these products when introduced;\n\u25cf\nour ability to control costs, including operating expenses and the costs of the components and subassemblies used in our products;\n\u25cf\nthe costs related to the acquisition and integration of product lines, technologies or businesses; and\n\u25cf\nthe costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, including defending our intellectual property against third-party claims or litigation.\nSeasonality has played an increasingly important role in the market for chip manufacturing tools. The period of November through February has been a particularly weak period historically for manufacturers of chip tools, in part because capital equipment needed to support manufacturing of chips for the December holidays usually needs to be in the supply chain by no later than October and chip makers in Asia often wait until after Chinese, or Lunar, New Year, which occurs in January or February, before implementing their capital acquisition plans. The timing of new product releases also has an impact on seasonality, with the acquisition of manufacturing equipment occurring six to nine months before a new release.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them could cause our operating results to vary widely. As a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our quarterly revenue accurately. Our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results for future quarters and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful. Variability in our periodic operating results could lead to volatility in our stock price. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of Class A common stock to decline. Moreover, as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our operating results might not meet our announced guidance or expectations of public market analysts or investors, in which case the price of Class A common stock could decrease significantly.\nCyclicality in the semiconductor industry is likely to lead to substantial variations in demand for our products, and as a result our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe chip industry has historically been cyclic and is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, this industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product and technology cycles, excess inventories and declines in general economic conditions. This cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next.\nOur business depends upon the capital spending of chip manufacturers, which, in turn, depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for chips. During industry downturns, chip manufacturers often have excess manufacturing capacity and may experience reductions in profitability due to lower sales and increased pricing pressure for their products. As a result, chip manufacturers generally sharply curtail their spending during industry downturns and historically have lowered their spending more than the decline in their revenues. If we are unable to control our expenses adequately in response to lower revenue from our customers, our operating results will suffer and we could experience operating losses.\nConversely, during industry upturns we must successfully increase production output to meet expected customer demand. This may require us or our suppliers, including third-party contractors, to order additional inventory, hire additional employees and expand manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to respond to a rapid increase in demand for our tools on a timely basis, or if we misjudge the timing, duration or magnitude of such an increase in demand, we may lose business to our competitors or incur increased costs disproportionate to any gains in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe PRC government is implementing focused policies, including state-led investment initiatives, that aim to create and support an independent domestic semiconductor supply chain spanning from design to final system production. If these policies, which include loans and subsidies, result in lower demand for equipment than is expected by equipment manufacturers, the resulting overcapacity in the chip manufacturing equipment market could lead to excess inventory and price discounting that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur success will depend on industry chip manufacturers adopting our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies.\nTo date our strategy for commercializing our tools has been to place them with selected industry leaders in the manufacturing of memory and logic chips, the two largest chip categories, to enable those leading manufacturers to evaluate our technologies, and then leverage our reputation to gain broader market acceptance. In order for these industry leaders to adopt our tools, we need to establish our credibility by demonstrating the differentiated, innovative nature of our SAPS, TEBO and Tahoe technologies. Our SAPS technology has been tested and purchased by industry leaders, but has not achieved, and may never achieve, widespread market acceptance. We have initiated a similar commercialization process for our TEBO technology with a selected group of industry leaders. If these leading manufacturers do not agree that our technologies add significant value over conventional technologies or do not otherwise accept and use our tools, we may need to spend a significant amount of time and resources to enhance our technologies or develop new technologies. Even if these leading manufacturers adopt our technologies, other manufacturers may not choose to accept and adopt our tools and our products may not achieve widespread adoption. Any of the above factors would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe ECP, furnace and other technologies do not achieve widespread market acceptance, we will not be able to compete effectively.\nThe commercial success of our tools will depend, in part, on gaining substantial market acceptance by chip manufacturers. Our ability to gain acceptance for our products will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to demonstrate the differentiated, innovative nature of our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies and the advantages of our tools over those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\ncompatibility of our tools with existing or potential customers\u2019 manufacturing processes and products;\n\u25cf\nthe level of customer service available to support our products; and\n\u25cf\nthe experiences our customers have with our products.\nIn addition, obtaining orders from new customers may be difficult because many chip manufacturers have pre-existing relationships with our competitors. Chip manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wet processing equipment into a chip production line. Due, in part, to the cost of manufacturing equipment and the investment necessary to integrate a particular manufacturing process, a chip manufacturer that has selected a particular supplier\u2019s equipment and qualified that equipment for production typically continues to use that equipment for the specific production application and process node, which is the minimum line width on a chip, as long as that equipment continues to meet performance specifications. Some of our potential and existing customers may prefer larger, more established vendors from which they can purchase equipment for a wider variety of process steps than our tools address. Further, because the cleaning process with our TEBO equipment can be up to five times longer than cleaning processes based on other technologies, we must convince chip manufacturers of the innovative, differentiated nature of our technologies and the benefits associated with using our tools. If we are unable to obtain new customers and continue to achieve widespread market acceptance of our tools, then our business, operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not continue to enhance our existing single-wafer wet cleaning tools and achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to compete effectively.\nWe operate in an industry that is subject to evolving standards, rapid technological changes and changes in customer demands. Additionally, if process nodes continue to shrink to ever-smaller dimensions and conventional two-dimensional chips reach their critical performance limitations, the technology associated with manufacturing chips may advance to a point where our Ultra C equipment based on SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies becomes obsolete. Accordingly, the future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our technological capabilities, our ability to interpret customer and market requirements in advance of tool deliveries, and our ability to introduce in a timely manner new tools that address chip makers\u2019 requirements for cost-effective cleaning solutions. We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new tools and enhancing existing tools. Our ability to introduce and market successfully any new or enhanced cleaning equipment is subject to a wide variety of challenges during the tool\u2019s development, including the following:\n\u25cf\naccurate anticipation of market requirements, changes in technology and evolving standards;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of qualified product designers and technologies needed to solve difficult design challenges in a cost-effective, reliable manner;\n\u25cf\nour ability to design products that meet chip manufacturers\u2019 cost, size, acceptance and specification criteria, and performance requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe ability and availability of suppliers and third-party manufacturers to manufacture and deliver the critical components and subassemblies of our tools in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our customers\u2019 products, and the lifecycle of those products; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to deliver products in a timely manner within our customers\u2019 product planning and deployment cycle.\nCertain enhancements to our Ultra C equipment in future periods may reduce demand for our pre-existing tools. As we introduce new or enhanced cleaning tools, we must manage the transition from older tools in order to minimize disruptions in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older tool inventories and ensure timely delivery of sufficient supplies of new tools to meet customer demand. Furthermore, product introductions could delay purchases by customers awaiting arrival of our new products, which could cause us to fail to meet our expected level of production orders for pre-existing tools.\nOur success will depend on our ability to identify and enter new product markets.\nWe expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources identifying new product markets in addition to the market for cleaning solutions and in developing new products for entry into these markets. Our TEBO technology took eight years to develop, and development of any new technology could require a similar, or even longer, period of time. Product development requires significant investments in engineering hours, third-party development costs, prototypes and sample materials, as well as sales and marketing expenses, which will not be recouped if the product launch is unsuccessful. We may fail to predict the needs of other markets accurately or develop new, innovative technologies to address those needs. Further, we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or cost-efficient manner, and our new products may be more costly to develop, may fail to meet the requirements of the market, or may be adopted slower than we expect. If we are not able to introduce new products successfully, our inability to gain market share in new product markets could adversely affect our ability to sustain our revenue growth or maintain our current revenue levels.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain a reputation for credibility and product quality, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our operating results may suffer.\nWe must develop and maintain a market reputation for innovative, differentiated technologies and high quality, reliable products in order to attract new customers and achieve widespread market acceptance of our products. Our market reputation is critical because we compete against several larger, more established competitors, many of which supply equipment for a larger number of process steps than we do to a broader customer base in an industry with a limited number of customers. In these circumstances, traditional marketing and branding efforts are of limited value, and our success depends on our ability to provide customers with reliable and technically sophisticated products. If the limited customer base does not perceive our products and services to be of high quality and effectiveness, our reputation could be harmed, which could adversely impact our ability to achieve our targeted growth.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and many of our competitors are larger, better-established, and have significantly greater operating and financial resources than we have.\nThe chip equipment industry is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition throughout the world in each of the markets we serve. Many of our current and potential competitors have, among other things:\n\u25cf\ngreater financial, technical, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources;\n\u25cf\nestablished credibility and market reputations;\n\u25cf\nlonger operating histories;\n\u25cf\nbroader product offerings;\n\u25cf\nmore extensive service offerings, including the ability to have large inventories of spare parts available near, or even at, customer locations;\n\u25cf\nlocal sales forces; and\n\u25cf\nmore extensive geographic coverage.\nThese competitors may also have the ability to offer their products at lower prices by subsidizing their losses in wet cleaning with profits from other lines of business in order to retain current or obtain new customers. Among other things, some competitors have the ability to offer bundled discounts for customers purchasing multiple products. Many of our competitors have more extensive customer and partner relationships than we do and may therefore be in a better position to identify and respond to market developments and changes in customer demands. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier, regardless of product performance or features. If we are not able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors, our business, operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. There are also a limited number of potential customers for our products.\nThe chip manufacturing industry is highly concentrated, and we derive most of our revenue from a limited number of customers. A total of two customers accounted for 48.9% of our revenue in 2021, three customers accounted for 75.8% of our revenue in 2020, and three customers accounted for 73.8% of our revenue in 2019.\nAs a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base, our revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate, and any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period.\nWe may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our larger customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger customers with purchases by new or existing customers. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger customers\u2019 buying patterns. Thus, our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our customers. The loss of any of our key customers for any reason, or a change in our relationship with any of our key customers, including a significant delay or reduction in their purchases, may cause a significant decrease in our revenue, which we may not be able to recapture due to the limited number of potential customers.\nWe have seen, and may see in the future, consolidation of our customer base. Industry consolidation generally has negative implications for equipment suppliers, including a reduction in the number of potential customers, a decrease in aggregate capital spending and greater pricing leverage on the part of consumers over equipment suppliers. Continued consolidation of the chip industry could make it more difficult for us to grow our customer base, increase sales of our products and maintain adequate gross margins.\nOur customers do not enter into long-term purchase commitments, and they may decrease, cancel or delay their projected purchases at any time.\nIn accordance with industry practice, our sales are on a purchase order basis, which we seek to obtain three to four months in advance of the expected product delivery date. Until a purchase order is received, we do not have a binding purchase commitment. Our customers to date have provided us with non-binding one- to two-year forecasts of their anticipated demands, but those forecasts can be changed at any time, without any required notice to us. Because the lead-time needed to produce a tool customized to a customer\u2019s specifications can extend up to six months, we may need to begin production of tools based on non-binding forecasts, rather than waiting to receive a binding purchase order. No assurance can be made that a customer\u2019s forecast will result in a firm purchase order within the time period we expect, or at all.\nIf we do not accurately predict the amount and timing of a customer\u2019s future purchases, we risk expending time and resources on producing a customized tool that is not purchased by a particular customer, which may result in excess or unwanted inventory, or we may be unable to fulfill an order on the schedule required by a purchase order, which would result in foregone sales. Customers may place purchase orders that exceed forecasted amounts, which could result in delays in our delivery time and harm our reputation. In the future a customer may decide not to purchase our tools at all, may purchase fewer tools than it did in the past or may otherwise alter its purchasing patterns, and the impact of any such actions may be intensified given our dependence on a small number of large customers. Our customers make major purchases periodically as they add capacity or otherwise implement technology upgrades. If any significant customers cancel, delay or reduce orders, our operating results could suffer.\nWe may incur significant expenses long before we can recognize revenue from new products, if at all, due to the costs and length of research, development, manufacturing and customer evaluation process cycles.\nWe often incur significant research and development costs for products that are purchased by our customers only after much, or all, of the cost has been incurred or that may never be purchased. We allow some new customers, or existing customers considering new products, to evaluate products without any payment becoming due unless the product is ultimately accepted, which means we may invest a significant amount in manufacturing a tool that may never be accepted and purchased or may be purchased months or even years after production. In the past we have borrowed money in order to fund first-time purchase order equipment and next-generation evaluation equipment. When we deliver evaluation equipment, or a \u201cfirst tool,\u201d we may not recognize revenue or receive payment for the tool for 24 months or longer. Even returning customers may take as long as six months to make any payments. If our sales efforts are unsuccessful after expending significant resources, or if we experience delays in completing sales, our future cash flow, revenue and profitability may fluctuate or be materially adversely affected.\nOur sales cycle is long and unpredictable, which results in variability of our financial performance and may require us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result, all of which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource-intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and variability of our sales cycle. A sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and any sale of our tools. Our sales process involves educating customers about our tools, participating in extended tool evaluations and configuring our tools to customer-specific needs, after which customers may evaluate the tools. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with a customer to the execution of a purchase order, is generally 6 to 24 months. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment, all of which lower our operating margins, particularly if no sale occurs or if the sale is delayed as a result of extended qualification processes or delays from our customers\u2019 customers.\nThe duration or ultimate success of our sales cycle depends on factors such as:\n\u25cf\nefforts by our sales force;\n\u25cf\nthe complexity of our customers\u2019 manufacturing processes and the compatibility of our tools with those processes;\n\u25cf\nour customers\u2019 internal technical capabilities and sophistication; and\n\u25cf\nour customers\u2019 capital spending plans and processes, including budgetary constraints, internal approvals, extended negotiations or administrative delays.\nIt is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, we may not recognize revenue from our sales efforts for extended periods of time, or at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed. In addition, we believe that the length of the sales cycle and intensity of the evaluation process may increase for those current and potential customers that centralize their purchasing decisions.\nDifficulties in forecasting demand for our tools may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excess spending on inventory items that may not be used.\nWe need to manage our inventory of components and production of tools effectively to meet changing customer requirements. Accurately forecasting customers\u2019 needs is difficult. Our tool demand forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, including non-binding forecasts received from our customers years in advance, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. Inventory levels for components necessary to build our tools in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate demand for our tools or if our manufacturing partners fail to supply components we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Such shortages might delay production or shipments to customers and may cause us to lose sales. These shortages may also harm our credibility, diminish the loyalty of our channel partners or customers.\nA failure to prevent inventory shortages or accurately predict customers\u2019 needs could result in decreased revenue and gross margins and harm our business.\nSome of our products and supplies may become obsolete or be deemed excess while in inventory due to rapidly changing customer specifications, changes in product structure, components or bills of material as a result of engineering changes, or a decrease in customer demand. We also have exposure to contractual liabilities to our contract manufacturers for inventories purchased by them on our behalf, based on our forecasted requirements, which may become excess or obsolete. Our inventory balances also represent an investment of cash. To the extent our inventory turns are slower than we anticipate based on historical practice, our cash conversion cycle extends and more of our cash remains invested in working capital. If we are not able to manage our inventory effectively, we may need to write down the value of some of our existing inventory or write off non-saleable or obsolete inventory. Any such charges we incur in future periods could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenue and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.\nIf our tools contain defects or do not meet customer specifications, we could lose customers and revenue.\nHighly complex tools such as our may develop defects during the manufacturing and assembly process. We may also experience difficulties in customizing our tools to meet customer specifications or detecting defects during the development and manufacturing of our tools. Some of these failures may not be discovered until we have expended significant resources in customizing our tools, or until our tools have been installed in our customers\u2019 production facilities. These quality problems could harm our reputation as well as our customer relationships in the following ways:\n\u25cf\nour customers may delay or reject acceptance of our tools that contain defects or fail to meet their specifications;\n\u25cf\nwe may suffer customer dissatisfaction, negative publicity and reputational damage, resulting in reduced orders or otherwise damaging our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u25cf\nwe may incur substantial costs as a result of warranty claims or service obligations or in order to enhance the reliability of our tools;\n\u25cf\nthe attention of our technical and management resources may be diverted;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to replace defective systems or invest significant capital to resolve these problems; and\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to write off inventory and other assets related to our tools.\nIn addition, defects in our tools or our inability to meet the needs of our customers could cause damage to our customers\u2019 products or manufacturing facilities, which could result in claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty, including claims from our customers. The cost of defending such a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be substantial and could divert management\u2019s attention from our ongoing operations. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate with respect to a claim or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, we may be liable for payment of substantial damages. Any or all of these potential consequences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nWarranty claims in excess of our estimates could adversely affect our business.\nWe have provided warranties against manufacturing defects of our tools that range from 12 to 36 months in duration. Our product warranty requires us to provide labor and parts necessary to repair defects. As of December 31, 2021, we had accrued $6.8 million in liability contingency for potential warranty claims. Warranty claims substantially in excess of our expectations, or significant unexpected costs associated with warranty claims, could harm our reputation and could cause customers to decline to place new or additional orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture significant portions of our tools and our failure to manage our relationships with these parties could harm our relationships with our customers, increase our costs, decrease our sales and limit our growth.\nOur tools are complex and require components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability, accuracy and performance. We rely on third parties to manufacture most of the subassemblies and supply most of the components used in our tools. Accordingly, we cannot directly control our delivery schedules and quality assurance. This lack of control could result in shortages or quality assurance problems. In addition, supply chain constraints have intensified due to COVID-19. See also \u201cRisks Related to the COVID 19 Outbreak-Our global supply chain may be materially adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d These issues and our ability to manage increased demand could delay shipments of our tools, increase our testing or production costs or lead to costly failure claims.\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts with some of our suppliers, and those suppliers are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. In addition, we attempt to maintain relatively low inventories and acquire subassemblies and components only as needed. There are significant risks associated with our reliance on these third-party suppliers, including:\n\u25cf\npotential price increases;\n\u25cf\ncapacity shortages or other inability to meet any increase in demand for our products;\n\u25cf\nreduced control over manufacturing process for components and subassemblies and delivery schedules;\n\u25cf\nlimited ability of some suppliers to manufacture and sell subassemblies or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices, due to the suppliers\u2019 relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources;\n\u25cf\nincreased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property; and\n\u25cf\nlimited warranties on subassemblies and components supplied to us.\nAny delays in the shipment of our products due to our reliance on third-party suppliers could harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, any increase in costs due to our suppliers increasing the price they charge us for subassemblies and components or arising from our need to replace our current suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers could negatively affect our operating results.\nAny shortage of components or subassemblies could result in delayed delivery of products to us or in increased costs to us, which could harm our business.\nThe ability of our manufacturers to supply our tools is dependent, in part, upon the availability certain components and subassemblies. Our manufacturers may experience shortages in the availability of such components or subassemblies, which could result in delayed delivery of products to us or in increased costs to us. Any shortage of components or subassemblies or any inability to control costs associated with manufacturing could increase the costs for our products or impair our ability to ship orders in a timely cost-efficient manner. As a result, we could experience cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers, including single source suppliers, for critical components and subassemblies, and our business could be disrupted if they are unable to meet our needs.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for components and subassemblies used in our tools. Certain components and subassemblies of our tools have only been purchased from our current suppliers to date and changing the source of those components and subassemblies may result in disruptions during the transition process and entail significant delay and expense. We rely on: Product Systems, Inc., or ProSys, as the sole supplier of megasonic transducers, a key subassembly used in our single-wafer cleaning equipment; Ninebell Co., Ltd., or Ninebell, as the principal supplier of robotic delivery system subassemblies used in our single-wafer cleaning equipment; and Advanced Electric Co. Inc., as a key supplier of valves used in our single-wafer cleaning equipment. An adverse change to our relationship with any of these suppliers would disrupt our production of single-wafer cleaning equipment and could cause substantial harm to our business.\nWith some of these suppliers, we do not have long-term agreements and instead purchase components and subassemblies through a purchase order process. As a result, these suppliers may stop supplying us components and subassemblies, limit the allocation of supply and equipment to us due to increased industry demand or significantly increase their prices at any time with little or no advance notice. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could also result in delivery problems, reduced control over product pricing and quality, and our inability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner.\nMoreover, some of our suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could prevent them from supplying us with components or subassemblies used in the design and manufacture of our products. In addition, our suppliers, including our sole supplier ProSys, may experience manufacturing delays or shut downs due to circumstances beyond their control, such as labor issues, political unrest or natural disasters. Any supply deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations. We have in the past and may in the future, experience delays or reductions in supply shipments, which could reduce our revenue and profitability. If key components or materials are unavailable, our costs would increase and our revenue would decline.\nWe have depended on PRC governmental subsidies to help fund our technology development since 2008, and our failure to obtain additional subsidies may impede our development of new technologies and may increase our cost of capital and our operational expenses, either of which could make it difficult for us to expand our product base.\nWe received subsidies from local and central governmental authorities in the PRC in 2008, 2009, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. These grants have provided a significant portion of the funding for our development and commercialization of stress-free polishing and electro copper-plating technologies. If we are unable to obtain similar governmental subsidies for development projects in the future, our operating expenses could increase, or we may need to raise additional funds through public financings, or other arrangements, which could force us to reduce our efforts to develop technologies beyond SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe and ECP.\nThe success of our business will depend on our ability to manage any future growth.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our business recently due, in part, to an expansion of our product offerings and an increase in the number of customers that we serve. For example, our headcount grew by 62% in 2021, 50% in 2020, and 32% in 2019. We will seek to continue to expand our operations in the future, including by adding new offices, locations and employees. Managing our growth has placed and could continue to place a significant strain on our management, other personnel and our infrastructure. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new products, enhance our technological capabilities, satisfy customer requirements, respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our business plan. In addition, any inability to manage our growth effectively could result in operating inefficiencies that could impair our competitive position and increase our costs disproportionately to the amount of growth we achieve. To manage our growth, we believe we must effectively:\n\u25cf\nhire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for research and development activities, sales and marketing personnel, service and support personnel and financial and information technology personnel;\n\u25cf\nmanage multiple relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties; and\n\u25cf\ncontinue to enhance our information technology infrastructure, systems and controls.\nOur organizational structure has become more complex, including as a result of the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO. We will need to continue to scale and adapt our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures, at both ACM Research and ACM Shanghai. The continued expansion of our infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and management resources before our revenue increases and without any assurances that our revenue will increase.\nWe are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and President and other senior management and key employees.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of our management, technical and sales personnel, including in particular Dr. David H. Wang, the Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of ACM Research. All of our senior management are at-will employees, which means either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time. If one or more of our other senior management were unable or unwilling to continue their employment with us, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner. Moreover, in connection with the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO, ACM Shanghai is now managed by a group of officers separate from those of ACM Research and those officers owe fiduciary duties to the various stakeholders of ACM Shanghai. We do not have employment or retention agreements with, or maintain key person life insurance policies on, any of our employees. Our business may be severely disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our senior management may join a competitor or form a competing company. The loss of Dr. Wang or other key management personnel, including our Chief Financial Officer, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from effectively growing our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. There is substantial competition for experienced management, technical and sales personnel in the chip equipment industry. If qualified personnel become scarce or difficult to attract or retain for compensation-related or other reasons, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs. New hires may require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity and may not become as productive as we expect. If we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions, we may experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers, which could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur ability to utilize certain U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under applicable tax laws.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforward amounts, or NOLs, of $56.1 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $0.5 million for U.S. state income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we had NOLs of $45.0 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $545,000 for U.S. state income tax purposes. The federal and state NOLs will expire at various dates in the future.\nUtilization of these NOLs could be subject to a substantial annual limitation if the ownership change limitations under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 and similar U.S. state provisions are triggered by changes in the ownership of our capital stock. Such an annual limitation would result in the expiration of the NOLs before utilization. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, including in connection with our initial public offering and concurrent private placement in November 2017, our follow on public offering in August 2019, and any future equity issuances. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change. Regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, may cause our existing NOLs to expire or otherwise become unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Additionally, U.S. state NOLs generated in one state cannot be used to offset income generated in another U.S. state. For these reasons, we may be limited in our ability to realize tax benefits from the use of our NOLs, even if our profitability would otherwise allow for it.\nAcquisitions that we pursue in the future, whether or not consummated, could result in other operating and financial difficulties.\nIn the future we may seek to acquire additional product lines, technologies or businesses in an effort to increase our growth, enhance our ability to compete, complement our product offerings, enter new and adjacent markets, obtain access to additional technical resources, enhance our intellectual property rights or pursue other competitive opportunities. We may also make investments in certain key suppliers to align our interests with such suppliers. If we seek acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider appropriate. We cannot readily predict the timing or size of our future acquisitions, or the success of any future acquisitions.\nTo the extent that we consummate acquisitions or investments, we may face financial risks as a result, including increased costs associated with merged or acquired operations, increased indebtedness, economic dilution to gross and operating profit and earnings per share, or unanticipated costs and liabilities. Acquisitions may involve additional risks, including:\n\u25cf\nthe acquired product lines, technologies or businesses may not improve our financial and strategic position as planned;\n\u25cf\nwe may determine we have overpaid for the product lines, technologies or businesses, or that the economic conditions underlying our acquisition have changed;\n\u25cf\nwe may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u25cf\nwe may have difficulty retaining the employees with the technical skills needed to enhance and provide services with respect to the acquired product lines or technologies;\n\u25cf\nthe acquisition may be viewed negatively by customers, employees, suppliers, financial markets or investors;\n\u25cf\nwe may have difficulty incorporating the acquired product lines or technologies with our existing technologies;\n\u25cf\nwe may encounter a competitive response, including price competition or intellectual property litigation;\n\u25cf\nwe may encounter difficulties related to required CFIUS approval (see also \u201c-Regulatory and Litigation Risks-Certain of our investments may be subject to review by and approval from CFIUS, which may prevent us from taking advantage of investment opportunities that would otherwise be advantageous to our stockholders\u201d);\n\u25cf\nwe may become a party to product liability or intellectual property infringement claims as a result of our sale of the acquired company\u2019s products;\n\u25cf\nwe may incur one-time write-offs, such as acquired in-process research and development costs, and restructuring charges;\n\u25cf\nwe may acquire goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges;\n\u25cf\nour ongoing business and management\u2019s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; and\n\u25cf\nour due diligence process may fail to identify significant existing issues with the target business.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture declines in the semiconductor industry, and the overall world economic conditions on which the industry is significantly dependent, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of chip manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the chip capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. Global economic and business conditions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. Additionally, in times of economic uncertainty our customers\u2019 budgets for our tools, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. This would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. As a result, economic downturns could cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including:\n\u25cf\na decline in demand for our products;\n\u25cf\nan increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers\u2019 inability to pay us;\n\u25cf\nan increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;\n\u25cf\nvaluation allowances on deferred tax assets;\n\u25cf\nrestructuring charges;\n\u25cf\nasset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u25cf\na decline in the value of our investments;\n\u25cf\nexposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;\n\u25cf\na decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and\n\u25cf\nchallenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.\nFluctuating levels of investment by chip manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenue, operating results and earnings. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which could result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations outside the United States and face risks associated with conducting business in foreign markets.\nSubstantially all of our sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were made to customers outside the United States. Our manufacturing center has been located in Shanghai since 2006 and substantially all of our operations are located in the PRC. We expect that all of our significant activities will remain outside the United States in the future. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities, including:\n\u25cf\nimposition of, or adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements, such as work stoppages and travel restrictions imposed in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf\nthe need to comply with the import laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions, including a range of U.S. import laws;\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings, and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we conduct business;\n\u25cf\ncompetition from local suppliers with which potential customers may prefer to do business;\n\u25cf\nseasonal reduction in business activity, such as during the Lunar New Year in parts of Asia and in other periods in various individual countries;\n\u25cf\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nreduced protection for intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nlonger sales cycles and reliance on indirect sales in certain regions;\n\u25cf\nincreased length of time for shipping and acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf\ngreater difficulty in responding to customer requests for maintenance and spare parts on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u25cf\nheightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, our consolidated financial statements; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions, geopolitical events or natural disasters in countries where we conduct our operations or where our customers are located, including political unrest, war, acts of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn particular, the Asian market is extremely competitive, and chip manufacturers may be aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers, including chip equipment manufacturers.\nWe may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country in which we do business. Our failure to manage these risks successfully could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a sizable portion of our costs are denominated in other currencies, principally the Chinese Renminbi and, to a lesser extent, the South Korean Won. Because many of our raw material purchases are denominated in Renminbi while the majority of the purchase orders we receive are denominated in U.S. dollars, exchange rates have a significant effect on our gross margin. We have not engaged in any foreign currency exchange hedging transactions to date, and any strategies that we may use in the future to reduce the adverse impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may not be successful. Our foreign currency exposure with respect to assets and liabilities for which we do not have hedging arrangements could have a material impact on our results of operations in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business.\nRegulatory Risks\nChanges in government trade policies could limit the demand for our tools and increase the cost of our tools.\nGeneral trade tensions between the United States and the PRC escalated beginning in 2018. In each of July, August and September 2018, June and September 2019, and February 2020, the U.S. government imposed a round of new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from the PRC in response to what the U.S. government characterizes as unfair trade practices. The PRC government responded to each of these rounds of U.S. tariff changes by imposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the United States. Higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by U.S. and PRC leaders.\nThe imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and PRC governments and the surrounding economic uncertainty may negatively impact the semiconductor industry, including reducing the demand of fabricators for capital equipment such as our tools. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit the ability of our customers to manufacture or sell semiconductors or to make the manufacture or sale of semiconductors more expensive and less profitable, which could lead those customers to fabricate fewer semiconductors and to invest less in capital equipment such as our tools. In addition, if the PRC were to impose additional tariffs on raw materials, subsystems or other supplies that we source from the United States, our cost for those supplies would increase. As a result of any of the foregoing events, the imposition or new or additional tariffs may limit our ability to manufacture tools, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, or inhibit our ability to sell tools or to purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nOur ability to sell our tools to Chinese customers may be restricted by regulatory actions.\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce, or BIS, recently has imposed and may continue to impose additional restrictions, including licensing requirements, under the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, with respect to certain PRC companies that impact the supply of U.S. products and certain non-U.S. products incorporating U.S. content, or that are manufactured using certain U.S. technology or software, to such companies and the sourcing of U.S. items by non-U.S. companies for use in manufacturing products for such companies. For example, BIS has recently added a number of PRC entities to the Entity List under the EAR which means that any items subject to the EAR, including certain non-U.S. produced products with U.S. content, require a BIS license for supply to the listed entities. Among other companies, in December 2020, SMIC, one of the largest chip manufacturers in the PRC, was added to the Entity List. Challenges faced by SMIC and its key suppliers as a result of the listing could indirectly impact SMIC\u2019s demand for, or our ability to supply, our products.\nWe cannot be certain what additional actions the U.S. government may take with respect to PRC entities, and whether such actions will impact our relationships with our PRC-based customers, including changes to the Entity List restrictions, other export regulations, tariffs or other trade restrictions, or whether the PRC government may take any actions in response to U.S. government action that may adversely affect our ability to do business with our PRC-based customers. Even in the absence of new restrictions, tariffs or trade actions imposed by the U.S. or PRC government, our PRC-based customers may take actions to reduce dependence on the supply of products subject to potential U.S. trade regulations, including our tools, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We are unable to predict the duration of the restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or of any additional governmental actions that may impact our relationships with our PRC-based customers, any of which could have a long-term adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in political and economic policies of the PRC government may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies.\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted in the PRC, and a substantial majority of our revenue is sourced from the PRC. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant extent by economics, political and legal developments in the PRC.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in the PRC are still owned by the government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over economic growth in the PRC by allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, regulating financial services and institutions, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past three decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. In the past the PRC government has implemented measures to control the pace of economic growth, and similar measures in the future may cause decreased economic activity, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the PRC government has been implementing policies to develop an independent domestic semiconductor industry supply chain, there is no guaranteed time frame in which these initiatives will be implemented. We cannot guarantee that the implementation of these policies will result in additional revenue to us or that our presence in the PRC will result in support from the PRC government. To the extent that any capital investment or other assistance from the PRC government is not provided to us, it could be used to promote the products and technologies of our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in political and economic policies with respect to the PRC may make it difficult for us to release the benefit of our investments.\nOn November 12, 2020, then-President Trump issued an executive order, or the Order, establishing a new sanctions program designed to prohibit U.S. persons from entering into transactions in certain publicly traded securities, as well as derivatives and securities designed to provide investment exposure to such securities, of any \u201cCommunist Chinese military company,\u201d or CCMC, as designated by the U.S. Department of Defense, or DOD, or the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Continued ownership of such securities by U.S. persons would be prohibited after a one-year divestment period from the time of designation of the issuer. A number of PRC issuers have been designated under this program and more could be added.\nOn December 3, 2020, SMIC was designated as a CCMC by the DOD, which was subsequently removed as of June 3, 2021. If SMIC had remained on the list at December 3, 2021, ACM Shanghai\u2019s continued possession of SMIC securities could have subjected ACM Shanghai and ACM Research to penalties. Certain implementation matters related to the scope of, and compliance with, the Order have not yet been resolved, and the ultimate application and enforcement of the Order may change due to, among other things, the change in the U.S. Presidential administration.\nIn addition, SMIC may be designated as a CCMC in the future, or we may seek to conduct business transactions with entities on the CCMC list in the future. Although the Order does not prohibit commercial relations with CCMC companies other than the securities transactions noted above, certain other export restrictions have been imposed under the Export Administration Regulations on some CCMC companies. These and any similar future U.S. government restrictions on our suppliers or customers may adversely affect our business operations in the PRC, overall company results or our financial condition.\nThe PRC\u2019s currency exchange control and government restrictions on investment repatriation may impact our ability to transfer funds outside of the PRC, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, otherwise fund and conduct our business, or pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue through ACM Shanghai, our PRC subsidiary. PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by ACM Shanghai only out of its retained earnings, which are determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations that differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The PRC regulations and ACM Shanghai\u2019s articles of association require annual appropriations of 10% of net after-tax profits to be set aside, prior to payment of dividends, as a reserve or surplus fund, which restricts ACM Shanghai\u2019s ability to transfer a portion of its net assets to us. Such reserved funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to ACM in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends.\nAs a result of these and other restrictions under PRC laws and regulations as well as restrictions under ACM Shanghai\u2019s bank loan agreements, we may be significantly restricted in our ability to transfer a portion of ACM Shanghai\u2019s net assets to ACM or other subsidiaries of ACM. We have no assurance that PRC governmental authorities in the future will not limit further or eliminate the ability of ACM Shanghai to purchase foreign currencies and transfer such funds to ACM to meet its liquidity or other business needs. Any inability to access funds in the PRC, if and when needed for use outside of the PRC, could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity and our business.\nCertain of our investments may be subject to review by and approval from CFIUS, which may prevent us from taking advantage of investment opportunities that would otherwise be advantageous to our stockholders.\nCertain of our investments may be subject to review by and approval from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. In the event that CFIUS reviews one or more of the our investments, there can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain or proceed with such investments on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, CFIUS may seek to impose limitations on one or more such investments that may prevent us from maintaining or pursuing investment opportunities that we otherwise would have maintained or pursued, which could adversely affect the performance of our investments and thus our overall performance. Certain of our stockholders may be non-U.S. investors, and in the aggregate, may comprise a substantial portion of our net asset value, which may increase the risks of such limitations being imposed in connection with investments pursued or made by us. Legislative and regulatory changes, including changes to agency practice, in the future may negatively impact our ability to realize value from certain existing and future investments, including by limiting exit opportunities or causing us to favor buyers that we believe are less likely to require CFIUS review, even in circumstances where other buyers may offer better terms or more consideration.\nWe are subject to government regulation, including import, export, economic sanctions, and anti-corruption laws and regulations, that may limit our sales opportunities, expose us to liability and increase our costs.\nOur products are subject to import and export controls in jurisdictions in which we distribute or sell our products. Import and exports control and economic sanctions laws and regulations include restrictions and prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and on our transfer of parts, components, and related technical information and know-how to certain countries, regions, governments, persons and entities.\nVarious countries regulate the importation of certain products through import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. The exportation, re-exportation, transfers within foreign countries and importation of our products, including by our partners, must comply with these laws and regulations, and any violations may result in reputational harm, government investigations and penalties, and a denial or curtailment of exporting. Complying with export control and sanctions laws for a particular sale may be time consuming, may increase our costs, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, we and the individuals working for us could incur substantial fines and penalties. Changes in export, sanctions or import laws or regulations may delay the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, require us to spend resources to seek necessary government authorizations or to develop different versions of our products, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, regions, governments, persons or entities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering or making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or directing business. Our exposure for violating these laws and regulations increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur auditor, as a registered public accounting firm operating in the PRC, is not permitted to be inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and consequently investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspections.\nBDO China Shu Lun Pan Certified Public Accountants LLP, or BDO China, is the independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included in this report in connection with our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. BDO China, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and applicable professional standards. BDO China is located in the PRC. The PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of auditors in the PRC without the approval of PRC authorities, and therefore BDO China, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in the PRC, is currently not inspected by the PCAOB.\nIn May 2013 the PCAOB announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Enforcement Cooperation with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of China pursuant to which the Ministry of Finance established a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations in both the PRC and the United States. More specifically, the Memorandum of Understanding provides a mechanism for the parties to request and receive from each other assistance in obtaining documents and information in furtherance of their investigative duties. In addition the PCAOB is engaged in continuing discussions with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance to permit joint inspections in the PRC of audit firms that are registered with the PCAOB and to audit PRC companies whose securities are listed on U.S. stock exchanges.\nThe PCAOB\u2019s inspections of firms outside of the PRC have identified deficiencies in audit procedures and quality control procedures, and such deficiencies may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of BDO China with respect to its audit of our consolidated financial statements may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate BDO China\u2019s audit procedures and quality control procedures by depriving investors of potential benefits from improvements that could have been facilitated by PCAOB inspections.\nWe could be adversely affected if proposed legislation is adopted regarding improved access to audit and other information and audit inspections of accounting firms, including registered public accounting firms operating in the PRC such as our auditor, or if Nasdaq\u2019s proposals requiring additional criteria to companies operating in \u201crestrictive markets\u201d become effective.\nBDO China, our independent registered public accounting firm, is not inspected by the PCAOB, as described in the preceding risk factor. We are one of 283 companies named in PCAOB\u2019s list of \u201cPublic Companies that are Audit Clients of PCAOB-Registered Firms from Non-U.S. Jurisdictions where the PCAOB is Denied Access to Conduct Inspections.\u201d\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure required of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and on December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosures in the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. These final amendments apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Form 10-K and other forms with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. Any such identified registrant will be required to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction, and will also require disclosure in the registrant\u2019s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence on, such a registrant. These actions are the latest in a series of recent proposed actions:\n\u2022\nIn December 2018 the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by U.S. regulators in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed reporting companies with significant operations in the PRC.\n\u2022\nIn June 2019 a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced bills in both houses of the U.S. Congress that, if passed, would have required the SEC to maintain a list of foreign reporting companies for which the PCAOB is not able to inspect or investigate an auditor report issued by a foreign public accounting firm. The proposed Ensuring Quality Information and Transparency for Abroad-Based Listings on our Exchanges Act, also referred to as the EQUITABLE Act, would have prescribed increased disclosure requirements for these reporting companies and, beginning in 2025, provided for the delisting from U.S. stock exchanges of reporting companies included on the SEC\u2019s list for three consecutive years.\n\u2022\nIn May 2020 Nasdaq requested approval by the SEC of proposals that would impact companies with businesses principally administered in jurisdictions defined as \u201crestrictive markets,\u201d which likely would encompass the PRC. These proposals contemplate, among other things, the application of more stringent listing criteria if a listed company\u2019s auditor does not demonstrate a PCAOB inspection record (as is the case with our auditor), employee expertise and training, or geographic or other resources sufficient to perform the company\u2019s audit satisfactorily. Examples of more stringent criteria that Nasdaq could apply include requiring: (a) higher levels of equity, assets, earnings or liquidity than are otherwise needed; (b) that any public offering to be underwritten on a firm commitment basis (involving more due diligence by the underwriter); and (c) the imposition of lock-up restrictions on directors and officers to allow market mechanisms to determine an appropriate price for shares before the insiders could sell. Alternatively, Nasdaq could deny continued listing to a company.\n\u2022\nIn April 2020 the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting the significant disclosure, financial reporting and other risks associated with emerging market investments, including the PCAOB\u2019s continued inability to inspect audit work papers of auditors in the PRC.\n\u2022\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which became law in December 2020, includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers whose audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in the auditor\u2019s local jurisdiction. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act also requires that, to the extent that the PCAOB has been unable to inspect an issuer\u2019s auditor for three consecutive years since 2021, the SEC shall prohibit its securities registered in the United States from being traded on any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market in the United States. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act to require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market in the United States if the PCAOB has been unable to inspect an issuer\u2019s auditor for two consecutive years instead of three. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB designated China and Hong Kong as jurisdictions where the PCAOB is not allowed to conduct full and complete audit inspections and has identified firms registered in such jurisdictions, including BDO China Shu Lun Pan Certified Public Accountants LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Pursuant to each annual determination by the PCAOB, the SEC will, on an annual basis, identify issuers that have used non-inspected audit firms.\nIt remains unclear what further actions the SEC, the PCAOB or Nasdaq may take to address these issues and what impact those actions will have on U.S. companies that have significant operations in the PRC and have securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange. Any such actions could materially affect our operations and stock price, including by resulting in our being de-listed from Nasdaq or being required to engage a new audit firm, which would require significant expense and management time.\nRisks Related to Our STAR Market Listing\nWe may not achieve the results contemplated by our business strategy and our strategy for growth in the PRC may not result in increases in the price of Class A common stock.\nWe cannot assure you that we will realize any or all of our anticipated benefits of the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO, which may not have the anticipated effects of including the strengthening of our market position and operations in the PRC. ACM Shanghai continues to have broad discretion in the use of the proceeds from the initial sales of shares to investors and the proceeds from the STAR IPO, and it may not spend or invest those proceeds in a manner that results in our operating success or with which ACM Research stockholders agree. Our failure to successfully leverage the completion of the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO to expand our PRC business could result in a decrease in the price of the Class A common stock, and we cannot assure you that the success of ACM Shanghai will have a an attendant positive effect on the price of the Class A common stock.\nPRC companies are critical to the global semiconductor industry, and our current business is substantially concentrated in the PRC market. Our inability to build, or any delay in growing, our PRC-based operations would materially and adversely limit our operations and operating results, including our revenue growth.\nACM Shanghai\u2019s status as a publicly traded company that is controlled, but less than wholly owned, by ACM Research could have an adverse effect on us.\nIn November 2021, we completed the STAR Listing and STAR IPO with respect to shares of ACM Shanghai. ACM Shanghai is our principal operating company and, prior to the STAR Listing process, was a wholly owned subsidiary of ACM Research. As the result of actions taken in connection with the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO, ACM Shanghai is no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of ACM Research, and the interests of ACM Shanghai may diverge from the interests of ACM Research and its other subsidiaries in the future. We may face conflicts of interest in managing, financing or engaging in transactions with ACM Shanghai, or allocating business opportunities between our subsidiaries, including future arrangements for operating subsidiaries other than ACM Shanghai to license and use our intellectual property. Substantially all of our intellectual property has been developed in the PRC and is owned by ACM Shanghai. As we expand our global operations through operating subsidiaries outside of the PRC, those operating subsidiaries may need to license intellectual property from ACM Shanghai in order to operate, and there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not preclude those operating subsidiaries from licensing the required intellectual property from ACM Shanghai on reasonable terms or at all.\nACM Research retains majority ownership of ACM Shanghai since the STAR IPO, but ACM Shanghai is managed by a separate board of directors and officers and those directors and officers will owe fiduciary duties to the various stakeholders of ACM Shanghai, including shareholders other than ACM Research. In the operation of ACM Shanghai\u2019s business, there may be situations that arise whereby the directors and officers of ACM Shanghai, in the exercise of their fiduciary duties, take actions that may be contrary to the best interests of ACM Research.\nIn the future, ACM Shanghai may issue options, restricted shares and other forms of share-based compensation to its directors, officers and employees, which could dilute ACM Research\u2019s ownership in ACM Shanghai. In addition, ACM Shanghai may engage in capital raising activities in the future that could further dilute ACM Research\u2019s ownership interest.\nACM Research and ACM Shanghai both are public reporting companies but each is subject to separate, and potentially inconsistent, accounting and disclosure requirements, which may lead to investor confusion or uncertainty that could cause decreased demand for, or fluctuations in the price of, one or both of the companies\u2019 publicly traded shares.\nSince ACM Shanghai completed the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO in November 2021, it has been subject to accounting, disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the STAR Market. At the same time, ACM Research remains subject to accounting, disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq. As a result, ACM Research and ACM Shanghai periodically will disclose information simultaneously pursuant to differing laws and regulations. Even though substantially all of the operations of ACM Research are currently conducted through ACM Shanghai, the information disclosed by the two companies will differ, and may differ materially from time to time, due to the distinct, and potentially inconsistent, accounting standards applicable to the two companies and disclosure requirements imposed by securities regulatory authorities, as well as differences in language, culture and expression habit, in composition of investors in the United States and PRC, and in the capital markets of the United States and the PRC.\nDiffering disclosures could lead to confusion or uncertainty among investors in the publicly traded shares of one or both companies. Differences between the price of ACM Shanghai shares on the STAR Market and the price of ACM Research Class A common stock on Nasdaq could lead to increased volatility, as some investors seek to arbitrage price differences. Moreover, such volatility could be exacerbated by the fact that ACM Shanghai shares currently represent substantially all of the assets of ACM Research.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Data Security\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our intellectual property, including our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies and the design of our Ultra C equipment, as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around, or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our intellectual property is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\n\u25cf\nPatent applications may not result in any patents being issued.\n\u25cf\nPatents that may be issued may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage.\n\u25cf\nOur competitors may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our potential product candidates.\n\u25cf\nThe PRC and other countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets and know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties and confidential information and inventions agreements with key employees, customers and suppliers, other parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this information independently. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe upon our patents. If our technologies are adopted, we believe that competitors may try to match our technologies and tools in order to compete. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings, including our current suits, could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. In addition, any future patent litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel. Most of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources, and they therefore are likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, including the PRC, which could materially, negatively affect our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products or proprietary technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States, including the PRC, can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe significant majority of our intellectual property has been developed in the PRC and is owned by ACM Shanghai. Implementation and enforcement of intellectual property-related laws in the PRC has historically been lacking due primarily to ambiguities in PRC intellectual property law. Accordingly, protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights in the PRC may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. As a result, third parties could illegally use the technologies and proprietary processes that we have developed and compete with us, which could negatively affect any competitive advantage we enjoy, dilute our brand and harm our operating results. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and given the relative unpredictability of the PRC\u2019s legal system and potential difficulties enforcing a court judgment in the PRC, there is no guarantee litigation would result in an outcome favorable to us.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license and may adversely affect our business.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may contain claims that overlap with the subject matter of our intellectual property. A third party has claimed in the past, and others may claim in the future, that our technology or products infringe their intellectual property. In some instances third parties may initiate litigation against us in an effort to prevent us from using our technology in alleged violation of their intellectual property rights. The risk of such a lawsuit will likely increase as our size and the number and scope of our products increase and as our geographic presence and market share expand.\nAny potential intellectual property claims or litigation commenced against us could:\n\u25cf\nbe time consuming and expensive to defend, whether or not meritorious;\n\u25cf\nforce us to stop selling products or using technology that allegedly infringes the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\ndelay shipments of our products;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to pay damages or settlement fees to the party claiming infringement;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u25cf\nforce us to attempt to redesign products that contain the allegedly infringing technology, which could be expensive or which we may be unable to do;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to indemnify our customers, suppliers or other third parties for any loss caused by their use of our technology that allegedly infringes the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights; or\n\u25cf\ndivert the attention of our technical and managerial resources.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents upon which our products or technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our products of which we are not aware.\nBreaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products to our customers, result in data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.\nWe increasingly depend upon our information technology systems to conduct our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development and manufacturing activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. Computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security, or that of our website, and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service. Because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. We have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third-party contractors, including our manufacturers, and our business operations also depend, in part, on the success of our contractors\u2019 own cybersecurity measures. Additionally, we face potential heightened cybersecurity risks during the COVID-19 pandemic as our level of dependence on our IT networks and related systems increases, stemming from employees working remotely, and the number of malware campaigns and phishing attacks preying on the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic increases. These heightened cybersecurity risks may increase our vulnerability to cyber-attacks and cause disruptions to our internal control procedures. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated cyberattacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including sensitive data regarding our employees or business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data, could be stolen. Should this occur, we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies. In addition, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed. Consequently, our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, the coronavirus, continues both in the United States and globally, and related government and private sector responsive actions are adversely affecting our business operations.\nWe have set forth below key risks from the COVID-19 pandemic that we have identified or experienced to date. The situation continues to evolve, however, and it is impossible to predict the effect and ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and results. While the quarantine, social distancing and other regulatory measures instituted or recommended in response to COVID-19 were expected to be temporary, such measures have remained in effect, and have changed, over the last year, and the duration of the business disruptions, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic could ultimately reduce demand for our products and our customers\u2019 chips and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSubstantially all of our operations are located in areas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and those operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe conduct substantially all of our product development, manufacturing, support and services in the PRC, and those activities have been directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on transportation and public appearances. We cannot assure you that closures or reductions of our PRC operations or production may not be necessary in upcoming months as the result of business interruptions arising from protective measures being taken by the PRC and other governmental agencies or of other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Mateo County in the San Francisco Bay area. The effects of actions taken by local governmental or other agencies may in the future may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.\nThe prolonged and broad-based shift to a remote working environment continues to create inherent productivity, connectivity, and oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, detect and prevent spam and problematic content, hold product sales and marketing events, and generate new sales leads, among others. In addition, the changed environment under which we are operating could have an effect on our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner. Additional and/or extended, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations could significantly impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work productively. Governmental restrictions have been globally inconsistent and it remains unclear when a return to worksite locations or travel will be permitted or what restrictions will be in place in those environments. We may experience increased costs as we continue to maintain our facilities for a safe work environment, in addition to potential effects on our ability to compete effectively and maintain our corporate culture.\nExtended periods of interruption to our corporate, development or manufacturing facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic could cause us to lose revenue and market share, which would depress our financial performance and could be difficult to recapture. Our business may also be harmed if travel to or from the PRC or the United States continues to be restricted or inadvisable or if members of management and other employees are absent because they contract the coronavirus, they elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or laboratory facilities, or they are subject to quarantines or other governmentally imposed restrictions.\nOur global supply chain may be materially adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe rely upon the facilities of our global suppliers with operations in the PRC, Japan, Taiwan and the United States to support our business. We source the substantial majority of our components from Asia. The pandemic has resulted in significant governmental measures in many countries being implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees both in and out of China and within many regions of the PRC. As a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain its spread, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to supply our components according to our schedule and specifications. Further, there may be logistics issues, including our ability and our supply chain\u2019s ability to quickly ramp up production, and transportation demands that may cause further delays. Supply chain constraints have intensified due to COVID-19, which has contributed to global shortages coupled with increased demand in the supply of semiconductors. If our suppliers\u2019 operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. While the disruptions and restrictions on the ability to travel, quarantines and temporary closures of the facilities of our suppliers, as well as general limitations on movement in the region, are expected to be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the production and distribution closures continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Business disruptions could also negatively affect the sources and availability of components and materials that are essential to the operation of our business. Moreover, our customers source a range of production equipment, supplies and services from other suppliers with operations around the world, and any reduction in supply capacity at those customers\u2019 factories due to the COVID-19 pandemic may reduce or even halt those customers\u2019 production and result in a decrease in the demand for our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our currently planned projects and investments in the PRC..\nOur strategy includes a number of plans to support the growth of our core business. In November 2021 we completed the STAR Listing and STAR IPO with respect to shares of ACM Shanghai, in May 2020 ACM Shanghai, through its wholly owned subsidiary Shengwei Research (Shanghai), Inc., entered into an agreement for a land use right in the Lingang region of Shanghai, and in July 2020 Shengwei Research (Shanghai), Inc. began a multi-year construction project for a new 1,000,000 square foot development and production center that will incorporate state-of-the-art manufacturing systems and automation technologies, and will provide floor space to support significantly increase production capacity and related research and development activities.. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts these projects will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 and related government measures, or other matters of global concern, continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate one or both of these planned projects could be materially adversely affected.\nIn September 2019 ACM Shanghai entered into a partnership agreement for the purposes of engaging in equity venture capital investments in strategic emerging and high-tech industries with a focus on the semiconductor industry. We cannot predict the ongoing effect that the COVID-19 outbreak in the PRC will have on companies that would otherwise be desirable investments for the partnership, and the outbreak or related governmental actions could significantly impair the ability of the partnership to identify desirable investments or our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the partnership.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing our shares\nClass A common stock only commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, on November 3, 2017, and the market price of Class A common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. The market price of Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u25cf\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u25cf\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in projections for the chips or chip equipment industries or in the operating performance or expectations and stock market valuations of chip companies, chip equipment companies or technology companies in general;\n\u25cf\nchanges in operating results;\n\u25cf\nany changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections, or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow Class A common stock;\n\u25cf\nadditional shares of Class A common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders or the anticipation of such sales;\n\u25cf\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u25cf\nlitigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic trends, including changes in the demand for electronics or information technology or geopolitical events such as war or acts of terrorism, or any responses to such events.\nIn recent years, the stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility of their stock price. Any such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, such a suit was filed against our company and certain members of our management team as described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Although the suit was dismissed with prejudice on January 10, 2022, similar litigation in the future could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFew if any companies with stock publicly traded in the United States has effected a STAR Market listing of stock of a PRC-based subsidiary, and it is therefore difficult to predict the effect of the STAR Listing and STAR IPO on the Class A common stock.\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission initially launched the STAR Market in June 2019 and trading on the Market began in July 2019. In November 2021 ACM Shanghai completed the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO. We believe we are one of the first publicly traded U.S. companies to complete an initial public offering of shares of a PRC subsidiary on the STAR Market. As a result, no assurance can be given regarding the effect of the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO on the market price of the Class A common stock. The market price of Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline, for reasons other than the risk and uncertainties described above, as the result of investor negativity or uncertainty with respect to the impact of the STAR Listing and STAR IPO.\nACM Research stockholders were not entitled to purchase ACM Shanghai shares in the pre-STAR Listing placement, and they may have limited opportunities to purchase ACM Shanghai shares now that the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO have been completed. Investors may elect to invest in our business and operations by purchasing ACM Shanghai shares on the STAR Market rather than purchasing ACM Research Class A common stock, and that reduction in demand could lead to a decrease in the market price for the Class A common stock.\nAn active trading market for Class A common stock may not be sustained.\nClass A common stock has been listed on Nasdaq only since November 3, 2017, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for Class A common stock will be sustained or maintained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop or maintain a liquid market for Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they publish negative evaluations of Class A common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry, the price of our stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade the Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the Class A common stock price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Class A common stock or fails to publish reports about the Class A common stock on a regular basis, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the Class A common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nRequirements associated with being a public reporting company involve significant ongoing costs and can divert significant company resources and management attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other rules and regulations of the SEC. We are working with our legal, independent accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public reporting company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures, and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public reporting companies will require considerable time, attention of management and financial resources. In addition, the changes we make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public reporting company on a timely basis.\nThe listing requirements of Nasdaq require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. The reporting requirements, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as our directors or executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, on acceptable terms.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, you may only receive a return on your investment in Class A common stock if the market price of Class A common stock increases.\nOur ability to pay dividends on Class A common stock depends significantly on our receiving distributions of funds from our subsidiaries in the PRC. PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by those subsidiaries only out of their retained earnings, which are determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations that differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The PRC regulations and our subsidiaries\u2019 articles of association require annual appropriations of 10% of net after-tax profits to be set aside, prior to payment of dividends, as a reserve or surplus fund, which restricts our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us. In addition, our subsidiaries\u2019 short-term bank loans restrict their ability to pay dividends to us.\nThe dual class structure of Class A common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nClass B common stock has twenty votes per share and Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of February 23, 2022, stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, who consist principally of our executive officers, employees, directors and their respective affiliates, collectively held 65.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between Class B and Class A common stock, holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of Class A common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 4.8% of all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the market price of Class A common stock.\nBecause of the market capitalization achieved by Class A common stock during October 2020, our charter no longer contemplates circumstances in which all of the shares of Class B common stock will mandatorily convert into Class A common stock. Instead, all of the Class B common stock generally will convert into Class A common stock only upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, and specific shares of Class B common stock will convert into Class A common stock upon future transfers by the holders of those shares. The potential conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term.\nDelaware law and provisions in our charter and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u25cf\nour dual class common stock structure provides holders of Class B common stock with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the total number of outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u25cf\nwhen the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock;\n\u25cf\namendments to our charter or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u25cf\nvacancies on the board of directors will be able to be filled only by the board and not by stockholders;\n\u25cf\nthe board, which currently is not staggered, will be automatically separated into three classes with staggered three-year terms;\n\u25cf\ndirectors will only be able to be removed from office for cause; and\n\u25cf\nour stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting and not by written consent;\n\u25cf\nonly our chair, our chief executive officer or a majority of our directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nour charter authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\n\u25cf\ncumulative voting in the election of directors is prohibited.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us. Any provision of our charter or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Class A common stock.\nOur charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or stockholders.\nOur charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u25cf\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us, our stockholders, creditors or other constituents by any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our charter or bylaws, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nBy becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our charter related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our charter may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company , including a \u201clarge accelerated filer.\u201d\nThe experience of the current members of our management team in managing a publicly traded company, in particular a company that is a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies is limited to their experience with our company since our initial public offering in November 2017. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a large accelerated filer subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our management team and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have been a large accelerated filer since December 31, 2020, which has increased our costs and demands on management.\nWe have been a large accelerated filer since December 31, 2020 and therefore no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As a large accelerated filer, we are subject to certain disclosure and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies but did not apply to us prior to December 31, 2020 due to our status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that we provide full and more detailed disclosures regarding executive compensation; and\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that we hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect that compliance with the additional requirements of being a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and cause management and other personnel to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to public company reporting requirements. In addition, if we are not able to comply with changing requirements in a timely manner, the market price of Class A common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which Class A common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, particularly as we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs a public company, and particularly as we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d effective as of December 31, 2020, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. These requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as our executive officers or on the board of directors, particularly to serve on the audit and compensation committees.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, beginning with respect to the year ending December 31, 2018, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, required our management to perform system and process evaluation and testing to allow it to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nInvestor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these requirements effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nShort sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our Class A common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that a seller does not own but rather has borrowed, or intends to borrow, from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the securities short. The use of the Internet, social media, and blogging have allowed short sellers to publicly attack a company\u2019s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called \u201cresearch reports\u201d that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by legitimate securities research analysts. Issuers with limited trading volumes or substantial retail stockholder bases can be particularly susceptible to higher volatility levels, and can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks.\nShort seller publications are not regulated by any governmental or self-regulatory organization or any other official authority in the United States and are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the SEC in Regulation Analyst Certification. Accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or, in some cases, outright fabrications. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the significant profits that can be made from running successful short attacks, short sellers will likely continue to issue such reports. Short-seller publications may create the appearance or perception of wrongdoing, even when they are not substantiated, and may therefore affect the reputation or perception of our company and management.\nWhile we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attacks, in many situations we could be constrained, for example, by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we are able to proceed against the relevant short seller.\nSuch short-seller attacks have caused, and may cause in the future, temporary or possibly long term, declines in the market price of Class A common stock and possible litigation initiated against us. During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, such a short-seller publication was issued with respect to our company and certain members of the management team, and was referenced by the plaintiffs in the litigation described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nGeneral\nOur production facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods tsunami, typhoons and volcanic activity, environmental disasters, health epidemics, and other events beyond our control such as power loss, telecommunications failures, and uncertainties arising out of armed conflicts or terrorist attacks. The frequency and intensity of severe weather events are reportedly increasing throughout the world as part of broader climate changes. Global weather pattern changes may pose long-term risks of physical impacts to our business. A substantial majority of our facilities as well as our research and development personnel are located in the PRC. Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of our facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, and adversely affect our product development schedules, shipments and revenue. In addition, any such catastrophic loss or significant damage could result in significant expense to repair or replace the facility and could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or primary market, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.", "PERMNO": 17045, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ACMR"}
