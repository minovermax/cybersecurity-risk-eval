{"cik": "731012", "company": "HEALTHCARE SERVICES GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors we have described below, as well as other related information contained within this annual report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and our financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. We believe that the risks described below are our most significant risk factors but there may be risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deemed to be immaterial. Therefore, any such unknown or deemed immaterial risks and uncertainties, as well as those noted below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide services to several clients which contribute significantly, on an individual, as well as aggregate basis, to our total revenues.\nWe have several clients who each have made a contribution to our total consolidated revenues ranging from 3% to 6%. Although we expect to continue the relationship with these clients, there can be no assurance thereof. The loss, individually or in combination, of such clients, or a significant reduction in the revenues we receive from such clients, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of our two operating segments. In addition, if any of these clients change or alter current payment terms it could increase our accounts receivable balance and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents.\nOur clients are concentrated in the health care industry which is currently facing considerable legislative proposals to reform it. Many of our clients rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors. Rates from such payors may be altered or reduced, thus affecting our Clients\u2019 results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide our services primarily to providers of long-term and post-acute care. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the \"Act\"), and is considering further legislation to reform healthcare in the United States which could significantly impact our clients. In July 2011, CMS issued final rulings which, among other things, reduced, effective October 1, 2011, Medicare payments to nursing centers by 11.1% and changed the reimbursement for the provision of group rehabilitation therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which delayed automatic spending cuts of $1.2 trillion, including reduced Medicare payments to plans and providers up to 2%. These discretionary spending caps were originally enacted under provisions in the Budget Control Act of 2011, an initiative to reduce the federal deficit through the year 2021, also known as \u201csequestration.\u201d The sequestration went into effect starting March 2013. In December 2013, the U.S. Congress enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which reduces the impact of the sequestration over the next two years. This began in fiscal year 2014 and extended the reduction in Medicare payments to plans and providers for two years through the year 2023. Some states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. We cannot predict what efforts, and to what extent, such legislation and proposals to contain healthcare costs will ultimately impact our clients\u2019 revenues through reimbursement rate modifications. Congress has enacted a number of major laws during the past decade that have significantly altered, or may alter, overall government reimbursement for nursing home services. Because our clients\u2019 revenues are generally highly reliant on Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement funding rates and mechanisms, the overall effect of these laws and trends in the long term care industry have affected and could adversely affect the liquidity of our clients, resulting in their inability to make payments to us on agreed upon payment terms. These factors, in addition to delays in payments from clients have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant additional bad debts in the future.\nFederal health care reform legislation\u2019s eventual impact, including requiring most individuals to have health insurance and establish new regulation on health plans, may adversely affect our operating costs and results of operations.\nThe Act includes a large number of health-related provisions that become effective over the next several years, including requiring most individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans. While much of the cost of the recent healthcare legislation enacted will begin in 2015 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time, changes to our healthcare cost structure could have an impact on our operating costs. Providing such additional health insurance benefits to our employees or the payment of penalties if such coverage is not provided, would increase our expense. If we are unable to pass-through these charges to our clients to cover this expense, such increases in expense could adversely impact our operating costs and results of operations.\nIn addition, under the Act, employers will have to file a significant amount of additional information with the Internal Revenue Service. These and other requirements related to compliance under the Act could result in increased costs, expanded liability exposure, and other changes in the ways we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees.\nWe have clients located in many states which have had and may continue to experience significant budget deficits and such deficits may result in reduction of reimbursements to nursing homes.\nMany states, in which our clients are located, have significant budget deficits as a result of lower than projected revenue collections and increased demand for the funding of entitlements. As a result of these and other adverse economic factors, state Medicaid programs are reconsidering previously approved increases in nursing home reimbursement or are considering delaying those increases. Some states have over the past year indicated they may be unable to make entitlement payments, including Medicaid payments to nursing homes. Any disruption or delay in the distribution of Medicaid and related payments to our clients will adversely affect their liquidity and impact their ability to pay us as agreed upon for the services provided.\nThe Company has substantial investment in the creditworthiness and financial condition of our customers.\nThe largest current asset on our balance sheet is our accounts and notes receivable balances from our customers. We grant credit to substantially all of our customers. Deterioration in financial condition across a significant component of our customer base could hinder our ability to collect amounts from our customers. The potential causes of such decline include national or local economic downturns, customers\u2019 dependence on continued Medicare and Medicaid funding and the impact of additional regulatory actions. When contractual terms are not met, we generally encounter difficulty in collecting amounts due from certain of our clients. Therefore, we have sometimes been required to extend the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms. These clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties. In making our credit evaluations, in addition to analyzing and anticipating, where possible, the specific cases described above, we consider the general collection risk associated with trends in the long-term care industry. We also establish credit limits, perform ongoing credit evaluation and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss. Notwithstanding our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure, our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends change in such a manner as to negatively impact their cash flows. If our clients experience a negative impact in their cash flows, it would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have a Paid Loss Retrospective Insurance Plan for general liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\nWe self-insure or carry a high deductible, and therefore retain a substantial portion of the risk associated with the expected losses under our general liability and workers' compensation programs. Under our insurance plans for general liability and workers\u2019 compensation, predetermined loss limits are arranged with our insurance company to limit both our per occurrence cash outlay and annual insurance plan cost. We regularly evaluate our claims pay-out experience and other factors related to the nature of specific claims in arriving at the basis for our accrued insurance claims estimate. Our evaluation is based primarily on current information derived from reviewing our claims experience and industry trends. In the event that our known claims experience and/or industry trends result in an unfavorable change in initial estimates of costs to settle such claims resulting from, among other factors, the severity levels of reported claims and medical cost inflation, it would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. During 2014, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $37,416,000 related to a change in estimate related to a change in reserve methodology through the utilization of a third party actuary. Although we engage third-party experts to assist us in estimating appropriate insurance accounting reserves, the determination of the required reserves is dependent upon significant actuarial judgments that have a material impact on our reserves. Changes in our insurance reserves as a result of our periodic evaluation of the related liabilities may cause significant volatility in our operating results.\nFederal, State and Local tax rules can adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to Federal, State and Local taxes in the United States and Canada. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision of income taxes. We believe our income tax estimates are reasonable. Although, if the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority disagrees with a taken tax position and upon final adjudication we are unsuccessful, we could incur additional tax liability, including interest and penalty. Such costs and expenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the taxability of our services is subject to various interpretations within the taxing jurisdictions of our markets. Consequently, in the ordinary course of business, a jurisdiction may contest our reporting positions with respect to the application of its tax code to our services. A jurisdiction\u2019s conflicting position on the taxability of our services could result in additional tax liabilities which we may not be able to pass on to our clients or could negatively impact our competitive position in the respective location. Additionally, if we fail to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations we could suffer civil or criminal penalties in addition to the delinquent tax assessment. In the taxing jurisdictions where our services have been determined to be subject to tax, the jurisdiction may increase the tax rate assessed on such services. We endeavor to pass-through to our clients such tax increases. In the event we are not able to pass-through any portion of the tax increase, our gross margin could be adversely impacted.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by unfavorable results of material litigation or governmental inquiries.\nWe are currently involved in civil litigations and government inquiries which arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters relate to, among other things, general liability, payroll or employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as adversely affect our reputation and business status with our clients whether we are ultimately determined to be liable or not. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and collective action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. The plaintiffs in these types of actions may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and such amounts may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nWe assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss of potential accrual in our financial statements. We would accrue an estimated loss contingency in our financial statements if it were probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the loss could be reasonably estimated. Due to the unpredictable and unfavorable nature of litigation, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The amount of actual losses may differ from our current assessment. As a result of the costs and expenses of defending ourselves against lawsuits or claims, and risks and consequences of legal actions, regardless of merit, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected or cause variability in our results compared to expectations.\nWe primarily provide our services pursuant to agreements which have a one year term, cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice after the initial 90-day service agreement period.\nWe do not enter into long-term contractual agreements with our clients for the rendering of our services. Consequently, our clients can unilaterally decrease the amount of services we provide or terminate all services pursuant to the terms of our service agreements. Any loss of a significant number of clients during the first year of providing services, for which we have incurred significant start-up costs or invested in an equipment installation, could in the aggregate materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company's business success depends on the management experience of our key personnel.\nWe manage and provide our services through a network of management personnel, from the on-site facility manager up to our executive officers. Therefore, we believe that our ability to recruit and sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and our ability to successfully execute projected growth strategies. Our professional management personnel are the key personnel in maintaining and selling additional services to current clients and obtaining new clients.\nWe may be adversely affected by inflationary or market fluctuations in the cost of products consumed in providing our services or our cost of labor. Additionally, we rely on certain vendors for housekeeping, laundry and dietary supplies.\nThe prices we pay for the principal items we consume in performing our services are dependent primarily on current market prices. We have consolidated certain supply purchases with national vendors through agreements containing negotiated prospective pricing. In the event such vendors are not able to comply with their obligations under the agreements and we are required to seek alternative suppliers, we may incur increased costs of supplies.\nDietary supplies, to a much greater extent than Housekeeping supplies, are impacted by commodity pricing factors, which in many cases are unpredictable and outside of our control. Although we endeavor to pass on to clients such increased costs, from time to time, sporadic unanticipated increases in the costs of certain supply items due to market economic conditions may result in a timing delay in passing on such increases to our clients. It is this type of spike in Dietary supplies\u2019 costs that could most adversely affect Dietary\u2019s operating performance. The adverse effect would be realized if we delay in passing on such costs to our clients or in instances where we may not be able to pass such increase on to our clients until the time of our next scheduled service billing review. We endeavor to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increase in such supplies\u2019 costs through consolidation of vendors, which increases our ability to obtain reduced pricing.\nOur cost of labor may be influenced by unanticipated factors in certain market areas or increases in the respective collective bargaining agreements of our clients, to which we assent. A substantial number of our employees are hourly employees whose wage rates are affected by increases in the federal or state minimum wage rate. We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions. As collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated or minimum wage rates increase, which will occur in at least twenty states in 2015, we may need to increase the wages paid to employees. This may be applicable to not only minimum wage employees but also to employees at wage rates which are currently above the minimum wage. Although we have contractual rights to pass such wage increases through to our clients, our delay in, or inability to pass such wage increases through to our clients could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny perceived or real health risks related to the food industry could adversely affect our Dietary segment.\nWe are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including food spoilage and food contamination. Our products are susceptible to contamination by disease-producing organisms, or pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, campylobacter, hepatitis A, trichinosis and generic E. coli. Because these pathogens are generally found in the environment, there is a risk that these pathogens could be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the manufacturing, processing or food service level. Our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and products are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards. Difficulties or failures by these companies in obtaining any required licenses or approvals or otherwise complying with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our revenue that is generated from these companies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that compliance with governmental regulations by our suppliers will eliminate the risks related to food safety.\nAdditionally, the Company may be subject to liability if the consumption of our food products causes injury, illness or death. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that the Company's products caused injury or illness could adversely affect the Company's reputation.\nEvents reported in the media, such as incidents involving food-borne illnesses or food tampering, whether or not accurate, can cause damage to the reputation of our dietary segment. In addition, to the extent there is an outbreak of food related illness in any of our client facilities, it could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investments may be subject to fluctuating and even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements and financial market conditions.\nAlthough management believes we have a prudent investment policy, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and in the market values of our investment portfolio which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our marketable securities are primarily invested in municipal bonds. We believe that our investment criteria which includes reducing our exposure to individual states, requiring certain credit ratings and limiting our investments\u2019 duration period, reduces our exposure related to the financial duress and budget shortfalls that many state and local governments currently face.\nMarket expectations are high and rely greatly on execution of our growth strategy and related increases in financial performance.\nManagement believes the historical price increases of our Common Stock reflect high market expectations for our future operating results. In particular, our ability to attract new clients, through organic growth or acquisitions, has enabled us to execute our growth strategy and increase market share. Our business strategy focuses on growth and improving profitability through obtaining service agreements with new clients, providing new services to existing clients, obtaining modest price increases on service agreements with clients and maintaining internal cost reduction strategies at our various operational levels. In respect to providing new services to new or existing clients, our strategy is to achieve corresponding profit margins in each of our segments. If, in the event we are not able to continue either historical client revenue and profitability growth rates or projected improvement in such factors, our operating performance may be adversely affected and the high expectations for our market performance may not be met. Any failure to meet the market\u2019s high expectations for our revenue and operating results may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Failure to maintain such controls could result in misstatements in our financial statements and potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or could cause us to delay the filing of required reports with the SEC and our reporting of financial results. Any of these events could result in a decline in the price of shares of our common stock. Although we have taken steps to maintain our internal control structure as required, we cannot assure you that control deficiencies will not result in a misstatement in the future.\nRecent government regulations may impact our ability to distribute dividends or the amount of such dividends to shareholders. Any decrease in or suspension of our dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. However, our dividend policy and the payment of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including the impact of changing laws and regulations, economic conditions, our results of operations and/or financial condition, capital resources, the ability to satisfy financial covenants and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. While we have continually increased the amount of our dividends, given these considerations, there can be no assurance these increases will continue and our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of Platinum Health Services, LLC and Platinum Health Services PEO, LLC with our operations.\nWe acquired the assets of Platinum Health Services, LLC and Platinum Health Services PEO, LLC (collectively \"Platinum\") on July 12, 2013. We have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the operations and business practices of Platinum with our existing operating and business practices. Potential difficulties we have encountered or may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to retain a substantial number of Platinum's existing clients;\n\u2022\nthe unanticipated or excessive diversion of management's resources;\n\u2022\nthe integration of new operations and personnel and the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, ongoing operations;\n\u2022\nthe failure to achieve expected financial results;\n\u2022\nthe inability to implement effective internal controls, procedures and policies for Platinum as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 within the time periods prescribed thereby;\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate Platinum in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from our acquisition of its assets; and\n\u2022\nthe potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen incurred expenses or delays associated with the acquisition.\nThese and other risks could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Platinum. In addition, these and other risks related to our acquisition of Platinum could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were unable to successfully address any of these risks, our overall business could be harmed.\nOur reorganization initiatives may not achieve the expected costs reductions.\nIn fiscal year 2015, the Company expects to transition its workers' compensation and certain employee health & welfare insurance programs to HCSG Insurance Corp. (\"HCSG Insurance\" or the \"Captive\"), its wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. HCSG Insurance currently provides general liability coverage to the Company. HCSG Insurance was formed in January 2014 to provide the Company with greater flexibility and cost efficiency in meeting its property & casualty and health & welfare needs. As part of this process, the Company recorded a non-cash adjustment of $37,416,000 to reflect estimated current and future insurance claims projected to be closed out over the next 15 to 17 years. Failure to achieve the expected costs reductions related to these reorganization initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 41292, "SIC": 7340, "TIC": "HCSG"}
