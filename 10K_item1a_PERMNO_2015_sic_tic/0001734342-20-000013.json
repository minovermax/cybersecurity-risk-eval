RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to risks potentially impacting our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. Any of the following risks could harm our strategic plan, business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition and the value of an investment in our stock. In evaluating us and our business and making or continuing an investment in our stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this Form 10-K and any risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. We may face other risks that are not contained in this Form 10-K, including additional risk that are not presently known, or that we presently deem immaterial. This Form 10-K and the risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section in this Form 10-K titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur strategic plan and growth strategy may not be achieved as quickly or as fully as we seek.\nWe have adopted and are in the process of implementing our strategic plan to simplify our business model and focus our activities as a community bank serving our domestic customers and select foreign depositors and wealth management customers. Our plan includes a focus on profitable growth, cross selling to gain a larger share of our respective customers' business, core deposit generation, loan growth in our local markets, changes in loan mix to higher margin loans, improving our customer experience, improving our business and operational processes, and achieving operating efficiencies and cost reductions. Our strategic plan includes significant changes, which may require certain changes in our culture and personnel. We seek to identify and serve our customers' needs better and more broadly, including our valued foreign customers. We have significantly reduced our international lending activities, while seeking higher margin domestic lending opportunities in our markets.\nThe strategic plan's technology changes and systems conversions involve execution risk and other risks. Our plans may take longer than we anticipate to implement, and the results we achieve may not be as successful as we seek, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Many of these factors, including interest rates, are not within our control. Additionally, the results of our strategic plan are subject to the other risks described herein that affect our business, which include:\n\u2022\nOur focus on domestic lending in highly competitive markets may not meet our objectives, and may pose additional or other risks than low margin loans to foreign financial institutions.\n\u2022\nOur funding has depended on foreign deposits and we may not be able to replace lost low cost foreign deposits with domestic deposits with similar costs and long-term customer relationships.\n\u2022\nOur business strategy includes growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\n\u2022\nThe benefits from our technology investments may take longer than expected to be realized and may not be as large as expected, or may require additional investments.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to reduce our cost structure, we may not be able to meet our profitability objectives.\n\u2022\nOur strategic plan may take longer than anticipated to execute, benefits may be more expensive to implement than is currently anticipated, and otherwise may achieve less than we expect, any of which could adversely affect our business growth, results of operations and financial conditions.\n\u2022\nOur wealth management business currently relies heavily on our Venezuelan customers. Our strategic plan for expanding our wealth management business to U.S.-based customers, in this highly competitive business, may not be as successful as we anticipate.\n\u2022\nAll our market and customer initiatives are being made in highly competitive markets.\n\u2022\nAny significant unanticipated or unusual charges, provisions or impairments, including as a result of any legal proceedings or industry regulatory changes, could adversely affect our ability to implement or realize the expected results of the strategic plan.\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses.\nOperational risks and losses can result from internal and external fraud; gaps or weaknesses in our risk management or internal audit procedures; errors by employees or third-parties; failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules in the various jurisdictions where we do business or have customers; failures in the models we generate and rely on to make decisions; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical, telecommunications or other essential utility outages; business continuity and data security system failures, including those caused by computer viruses, cyberattacks, unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems, upgrades to existing systems or inadequate access to data or poor response capabilities in light of such business continuity and data security system failures; or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls, including those of our suppliers or counterparties. The Bank is pursuing actions toward improving its operational efficiency, which includes process automation and organizational realignment that could bring potential increased operational risk. Additionally, providing services outside the U.S. to non-U.S. persons may involve greater complexity and risks than providing such services in our primary U.S. markets. Although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures, identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff, there is no assurance that such actions will be effective in controlling all of the operational risks faced by us.\nMarket conditions and economic cyclicality may adversely affect our industry.\nWe are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy and market conditions generally. We believe the following, among other things, may affect us in 2020 and beyond:\n\u2022\nWe expect to face continued high levels of regulation of our industry as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, related rulemaking and other initiatives by the U.S. government and its regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB. Compliance with such laws and regulations may increase our costs, reduce our profitability, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and serve customers\u2019 needs. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, or the 2018 Growth Act, various pending bills in Congress and statements by our regulators may offer some regulatory relief for banking organizations of our size. We believe that comprehensive regulatory relief will be slow and contentious. We are uncertain about the scope, nature and timing of any regulatory relief, and its effect on us, if any.\n\u2022\nMarket developments, including employment and price levels, stock market volatility and declines, and tax changes, may affect consumer confidence levels from time to time in different directions, and may cause adverse changes in payment behaviors and payment rates, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could affect our charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\n\u2022\nDespite having one of the lowest unemployment rates in the history, the U.S. Economy is not showing significant GDP growth or inflationary pressures. Extreme market events like disruptions in global method of payments due to prolonged and severe weather conditions, insolvency of large market participants, outbreak of life threatening epidemics or pandemics (including but not limited to the novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19), default in payments of systemically important financial institutions, or organized acts of terrorism with high impact over several interconnected financial markets, may trigger unexpected and significant decreases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve or other Central Banks to correct market distortions and/or provide sufficient liquidity to market participants. In addition, trade conflicts between the U.S. and China, Brexit and other geopolitical events have created specific shocks to financial markets. The Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark interest rate three times in 2019 and another 50 basis points more recently in 2020 in the first between-meetings move since the financial crisis. These decreases have brought the benchmark interest rate from 2.50% at the close of 2018 to 1.25% at the filing of this Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers and those we do business with, and to estimate the values of our assets and collateral for loans may be impaired if the models and approaches we use become less predictive of future behaviors and valuations. The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure, or estimate the value of certain assets, requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how those economic predictions might affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans or the value of assets.\n\u2022\nThe 2017 Tax Act substantially limits the deductibility of all state and local taxes for U.S. taxpayers, including property taxes, and lowers the cap on the amount of primary and secondary residential mortgage indebtedness for which U.S. taxpayers may deduct interest. These changes, with or without increases in interest rates, generally, could have adverse effects on home sales, the volume of new mortgage and home equity loans and the values and saleability of residences held as collateral for loans.\n\u2022\nOur ability to borrow from and engage in other business with other financial institutions on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including, among other things, investor expectations and changes in regulations in the U.S. and foreign markets.\n\u2022\nFailures of other financial institutions in our markets and increasing consolidation of financial services companies as a result of market conditions could increase our deposits and assets and necessitate additional capital, and could have unexpected adverse effects upon us and our business.\n\u2022\nThe \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d including final regulations adopted in December 2013, may affect us adversely by reducing market liquidity and securities inventories at those institutions where we buy and sell securities for our portfolio and increasing the bid-ask spreads on securities we purchase or sell. These rules have decreased the range of permissible investments, such as certain collateralized loan obligation interests, which we could otherwise use to diversify our assets and for asset/liability management. The 2018 Growth Act removed Volcker Rule restrictions on banks under $10 billion in assets, and the federal banking agencies finalized a rule with required compliance by January 1, 2021, that simplifies and tailors compliance requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Other Legislative and Regulatory Changes.\u201d\nOur profitability and liquidity may be affected by changes in interest rates and interest rate levels, the shape of the yield curve and economic conditions.\nOur profitability depends upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income will be adversely affected by market interest rate changes where the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments. Interest rates, and consequently our results of operations, are affected by general economic conditions (domestic and international) and fiscal and monetary policies, as well as expectations of these rates and policies, and the shape of the yield curve.\nOur balance sheet is asset sensitive. Therefore, a decrease in interest rates or a flattening or inversion of the yield curve could adversely affect us, generally. In addition, in declining rate environments, we may experience a significant number of loan prepayments and replacement loans may be priced at a lower rate generating a decrease in our net interest income.\nThe production of mortgages and other loans and the value of collateral securing our loans, are dependent on demand within the markets we serve, as well as interest rates. Increases in interest rates generally decrease the market values of fixed-rate, interest-bearing investments and loans held, the value of mortgage and other loans produced, including long term fixed-rate loans and the value of loans sold, mortgage loan activities and the collateral securing our loans, and therefore may adversely affect our liquidity and earnings, to the extent not offset by potential increases in our NIM.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates, inflation and competitive pressures.\nOur cost of funds may increase as result of competitive pressures in the markets we operate, liquidity pressures in wholesale funding and inflationary pressures coming from the performance of the economy. Traditionally, we have obtained funds principally through deposits, including deposits from foreign persons, and borrowings from other institutional lenders. Generally, we believe deposits are a cheaper and more stable source of funds than borrowings because interest rates paid for deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders. We expect that our future growth will depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong, low-cost deposit base from U.S. domiciled persons. Increases in interest rates could also cause consumers to further shift their funds to more interest bearing instruments and to increase the competition for funds. If customers reduce the mix of their interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposits, or move money to higher rate deposits or other interest bearing assets offered by competitors or from transaction deposits to higher interest bearing time deposits, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Fiscal and Monetary Policy.\u201d\nMany of our loans and our obligations for borrowed money are priced based on variable interest rates tied to the London Interbank Offering Rate, or LIBOR. We are subject to risks that LIBOR will no longer be available as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority ceasing to require the submission of LIBOR quotes after 2021.\nThe anticipated cessation of LIBOR quotes after 2021 creates substantial risks to the banking industry, including us. Unless alternative rates can be negotiated and determined, our floating rate loans, funding and derivative obligations that specify the use of a LIBOR index, will no longer adjust and may become fixed rate instruments at the time LIBOR ceases to exist. This would adversely affect our asset/liability management and could lead to more asset and liability mismatches and interest rate risk unless appropriate LIBOR alternatives are developed. It could also cause confusion that could disrupt the capital and credit markets as a result of confusion or uncertainty.\nSeveral regulators, including the Federal Reserve, and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries have sponsored initiatives aimed at (a) transitioning to alternative reference rates and (b) addressing risks in legacy contracts language given the possibility that LIBOR might cease being published. In spite of progress made by regulators and market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR, uncertainties still remain; including whether replacement benchmark rates will become a market standard that replaces LIBOR, and if so, its effects on the terms of any transaction or financial instrument, our customers, or our future results of operations or financial condition.\nThe expected discontinuance in LIBOR may also affect interest rate hedges and result in certain of these becoming ineffective and ineligible for hedge accounting.\nOur derivative instruments may expose us to certain risks.\nWe use, from time to time, derivative instruments to offset current or future changes in cash flows of certain of our advances with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, or FHLB, which we are a member of. In addition, we enter into matched offsetting derivative transactions in order to manage credit exposure arising from derivative transactions with customers. We may enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, futures, forwards, and interest rate and credit default swaps, with a number of counterparties. Amounts that we expect to collect under current and future derivatives are subject to counterparty risk. Our obligations under our borrowings are not changed by our hedging activities and we are liable for our obligations even if our derivative counterparties do not pay us. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Substantially all of our derivatives require us to pledge or receive collateral or make payments related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives executed through a specific broker at a clearinghouse or entered into with a specific counterparty on a bilateral basis. In addition, ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of derivative counterparties may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the impacted businesses.\nOur valuation of securities and investments and the determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nFixed maturity securities, as well as short-term investments that are reported at estimated fair value, represent the majority of our total investments. We define fair value generally as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In addition, in times of financial market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. In those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and management judgment. Valuations may result in estimated fair values which vary significantly from the amount at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially affect the valuation of securities in our financial statements and the period-to-period changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly. Decreases in the estimated fair value of securities we hold may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nThe determination of the amount of impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. We reflect any changes in impairments in earnings as such evaluations are revised. However, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. In addition, any such future impairments or allowances could have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and financial position. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nOur success depends on our ability to compete effectively in highly competitive markets.\nThe banking markets in which we do business are highly competitive and our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets. We compete for deposits, loans, and other financial services in our markets with other local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage lenders, trust services providers and securities advisory and brokerage firms. Marketplace lenders operating nationwide over the internet are also growing rapidly. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we are able to and have broader and more diverse customer and geographic bases to draw upon. The Dodd-Frank Act allows others to branch into our markets more easily from other states. Failures of other banks with offices in our markets and small institutions wishing to sell or merge due to cost pressures could also lead to the entrance of new, stronger competitors in our markets.\nOur success depends on general and local economic conditions where we operate.\nOur success depends on economic conditions, generally, especially in the geographic markets we serve. The local economic conditions in our markets have a significant effect on our commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay our loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans. Adverse changes in economic conditions in the regions where our loans are originated, primarily South Florida, the greater Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas areas, and the greater New York City area. Further, our loan production, generally, is subject to seasonality, with the lowest volume typically in the first quarter of each year. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition.\u201d\nSevere weather, natural disasters, global pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, theft, civil unrest, government expropriation or other external events could have significant effects on our business.\nSevere weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods, acts of war or terrorism, epidemics and global pandemics (such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19), theft, civil unrest, government expropriation, condemnation or other external events in the markets where we operate or where our customers live (including Venezuela, which is experiencing civil unrest, a depreciated currency and hyperinflation) could have a significant effect on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, impair employee productivity, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery and business continuity policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business is mainly concentrated in three markets-South Florida, the greater Houston, Texas area and the greater New York City area, which may increase our risks from extreme weather. For example, in Fall 2017, both the greater Houston, Texas area and South Florida were struck by major hurricanes within days of each other.\nDefaults by or deteriorating asset quality of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and investment funds, our correspondent banks and other financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of the default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also may have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivatives and other securities. Further, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in response to financial crises affecting the global banking system and financial markets, such as nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, whether under existing legal authority or any new authority that may be created, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks\u2019 creditworthiness, could adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. Any losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nNonperforming and similar assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our nonperforming loans totaled $32.9 million and $17.8 million, respectively, or 0.6% and 0.3% of total loans, respectively. In addition, we had other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) of $42 thousand and $0.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our non-performing assets may adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO, and these assets require higher loan administration and other costs, thereby adversely affecting our income. Decreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral, or in the related borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental to their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans, OREO and similar nonperforming assets in the future.\nChanges in the real estate markets, including the secondary market for residential mortgage loans, may adversely affect us.\nNotwithstanding changes made in the 2018 Growth Act, the following matters could have serious adverse effects on the mortgage markets and our mortgage operations: the effects of the CFPB changes to mortgage and servicing rules effective at the beginning of 2014; the CFPB\u2019s unified Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, rules for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property that became effective in October 2015, often called TRID rules; enforcement actions, reviews and settlements, changes in the securitization rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, including the risk retention rules that became effective December 24, 2016; and the Basel III Capital Rules (see \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Basel III Capital Rules\u201d).\nThe TRID rules have affected our current and proposed mortgage business and have increased our costs as a result of our compliance efforts. In addition, the CFPB\u2019s final regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, which require that lenders determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan, which became effective in January 2014, have limited the secondary market for and liquidity of many mortgage loans that are not \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d\nNewly issued regulatory guidance provides for increased thresholds for requiring appraisals on residential real estate transactions. These new guidance increases the appraisal threshold for residential real estate transactions from $250,000 to $400,000. More lenient appraisal requirements increase the risk of overestimating property values during the loan origination process that may result in inadequate collateral coverage during a market downturn and thus result in increased losses. The Company adopted this new threshold for the home equity loans only, and did not change the appraisal requirements for residential loans.\nThe Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, have been in conservatorship since September 2008. Minimal capital at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the levels of risky assets at the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, and the FHA\u2019s relatively low capital and reserves for losses, the current or future levels of home sales, and the risks of interest rates increasing materially from historically low levels, as well as the 2017 Tax Act limitation on the deductibility of residential mortgage loan interest and state and local property and other taxes, could also have serious adverse effects on the mortgage markets and our mortgage operations. Such adverse effects could include, among other things, price reductions in single family home values, further adversely affecting the liquidity and value of collateral securing commercial loans for residential acquisition, construction and development, as well as residential mortgage loans that we hold, mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans. In the event our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to cover such losses, if any, our earnings, capital and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.\nWe periodically review our allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. We cannot be certain that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets, and changes in borrower behaviors. Differences between our actual experience and assumptions and the effectiveness of our models may adversely affect our business, financial condition, including liquidity and capital, and results of operations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standard Update, or ASU, No. 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d or CECL, on June 16, 2016, which changed the loss model to take into account current expected credit losses. As an emerging growth company, CECL will be effective for our fiscal quarter after December 31, 2022. However, if we cease to be an emerging growth company, CECL becomes effective for our first fiscal quarter after losing the EGC status. CECL will substantially change how we calculate our allowance for loan losses. We cannot predict when and how it will affect our results of operations and the volatility of such results and our financial condition, including our regulatory capital.\nIf our business does not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or other long-lived assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe had goodwill of $19.5 million and $19.2 million on December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which primarily represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets of a savings bank acquired in 2006 and the Cayman Bank Acquisition in 2019. We perform our goodwill impairment testing annually using a process which requires the use of fair value estimates and judgment. The estimated fair value is affected by the performance of the business, which may be especially diminished by prolonged market declines. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Although we have had no goodwill write-downs historically, any such write-downs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nLong-lived assets, including assets such as real estate, also require impairment testing. This testing is done to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we will be unable to recover the carrying amount of these assets. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the timing differences between financial accounting and tax reporting. Deferred tax assets, or DTAs, are assessed periodically by management to determine whether they are realizable. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate future taxable income. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, changes in the corporate tax rates could affect the value of our DTAs and may require a write-off of a portion of some of those assets. The 2017 Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective for periods starting January 1, 2018, from a prior rate of 35%. At December 31, 2019, we had net DTAs with a book value of $5.5 million, based on a U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%. In December 2017, we remeasured our net DTAs and recorded $9.6 million in additional tax expense and a corresponding reduction in net income as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nMortgage Servicing Rights, or MSRs, requirements may change and require us to incur additional costs and risks.\nThe CFPB adopted new residential mortgage servicing standards in January 2014 that add additional servicing requirements, increase our required servicer activities and delay foreclosures, among other things. These may adversely affect our costs to service residential mortgage loans, and together with the Basel III Capital Rules, may decrease the returns on MSRs. Declines in interest rates tend to reduce the value of MSRs as refinancings may reduce serviced mortgages.\nThe CFPB and the bank regulators continue to bring enforcement actions and develop proposals, rules and practices that could increase the costs of providing mortgage servicing. Historically, we have not serviced mortgage loans for others. However, if we were to provide servicing in the future, regulation of mortgage servicing could make it more difficult and costly to timely realize the value of collateral securing such loans upon a borrower default.\nWe may be contractually obligated to repurchase mortgage loans we sold to third-parties on terms unfavorable to us.\nAs a routine part of our business, we originate mortgage loans that we subsequently sell to investors. We do not currently originate mortgage loans for direct sale to any governmental agencies and government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, but expect to make such direct sales in the future. In connection with the sale of these loans to private investors and GSEs, we make customary representations and warranties, the breach of which may result in our being required to repurchase the loan or loans. Furthermore, the amount paid may be greater than the fair value of the loan or loans at the time of the repurchase. No mortgage loan repurchase requests have been made to us; however, if repurchase requests were made to us, we may have to establish reserves for possible repurchases, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur concentration of CRE loans could result in further increased loan losses, and adversely affect our business, earnings, and financial condition.\nCRE is cyclical and poses risks of possible loss due to concentration levels and risks of the assets being financed, which include loans for the acquisition and development of land and residential construction. The federal bank regulators released guidance in 2006 on \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending.\u201d The guidance defines CRE loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development and construction (including 1-4 family residential construction), multi-family property, and non-farm nonresidential property, where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50% or more of the source of repayment comes from third-party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. Loans to real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, and unsecured loans to developers that closely correlate to the inherent risks in CRE markets would also be considered CRE loans under the guidance. Loans on owner occupied CRE are generally excluded.\nThe Bank\u2019s portfolio of CRE loans was 353.3% of its risk-based capital, or 51.7% of its total loans, as of December 31, 2019 compared to 344.6% of its risk-based capital, or 51.4% of its total loans, as of December 31, 2018. Our CRE loans included approximately $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion of fixed rate loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These may adversely affect our margins in a rising interest rate environment and present asset/liability mismatches and risks since our liabilities are generally floating rate or have shorter maturities.\nThe banking regulators continue to scrutinize CRE lending and further addressed their concerns over CRE activity in December 2016, requiring banks with higher levels of CRE loans to implement more robust underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as higher levels of allowances for possible losses and capital levels as a result of CRE lending growth and exposures. Lower demand for CRE, and reduced availability of, and higher costs for, CRE lending could adversely affect our CRE loans and sales of our OREO, and therefore impact our earnings and financial condition, including our capital and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 56% of total CRE loans were in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, Florida, 24% were in the greater New York City area, including all five boroughs, and 15% were in the greater Houston, Texas area. The remainder were in other Florida, Texas and New York/New Jersey markets. Our CRE loans are affected by economic conditions in those markets.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, proceeds from loan repayments or sales, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, core and non-core deposits (domestic and foreign), and short-and long-term debt. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity. We are also members of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, from which we can obtain advances collateralized with eligible assets. There are other sources of liquidity available to us or the Bank should they be needed, including our ability to acquire additional non-core deposits (such as reciprocal deposit programs and brokered deposits). We may be able, depending upon market conditions, to otherwise borrow money or issue and sell debt and preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy in general. Our ability to borrow or obtain funding, if needed, could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Federal Reserve Act, Section 23A, limits our ability to borrow from the Bank, and the Company generally relies on dividends paid from the Bank for funds to meet its obligations, including under its outstanding trust preferred securities. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by law, and may be limited by regulatory action to preserve the Bank\u2019s capital adequacy. Any such limitations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nCertain funding sources may not be available to us and our funding sources may prove insufficient and/or costly to replace.\nAlthough we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, we may not be able to replace these funds in the future if our financial condition or general market conditions change. The use of brokered deposits has been particularly important for the funding of our operations. If we are unable to issue brokered deposits, or are unable to maintain access to other funding sources, our results of operations and liquidity would be adversely affected. Our ability to accept, renew or replace brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval will be limited if the Bank does not remain well-capitalized.\nAlternative funding to deposits may carry higher costs than sources currently utilized. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive and potentially less stable funding sources, profitability and liquidity could be adversely affected. We may determine to seek debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Any Company or Bank debt that is to be treated as capital for bank regulatory purposes requires prior Federal Reserve approval, which the Federal Reserve may not grant. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on acceptable terms. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and our credit capacity. In addition, the Bank may seek to sell loans as an additional source of liquidity. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur Venezuelan deposit concentration may lead to conditions in Venezuela adversely affecting our operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, 39.4% of our deposits, or approximately $2.3 billion, were from Venezuelan residents. The Bank\u2019s Venezuelan deposits declined 42.1% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2019 and continue to decline. These declines were due in part to actions by the Company to reduce its compliance costs and from economic conditions in Venezuela that adversely affected our Venezuelan customers\u2019 ability to generate and save U.S. dollars and the use of their deposits to fund living expenses and other investment activities. All of the Bank\u2019s deposits are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Adverse economic conditions in Venezuela may continue to negatively affect our Venezuelan deposit base and our ability to retain and grow these relationships, as customers rely on their Dollar deposits to spend without being able to earn additional Dollars. Since 2018, Venezuela\u2019s economy has experienced hyperinflation according to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Economy Outlook and is expected to continue to experience hyperinflation in 2020. All of these factors greatly influence our Venezuelan customers\u2019 access to Dollars and their ability to replenish the Dollars they consume.\nAlthough foreign depositors may not seek as high yielding deposits as domestic customers, foreign deposits require additional scrutiny and higher costs to originate and maintain than domestic deposits in the U.S. The Bank has adopted strategies to manage and retain its foreign deposits consistent with U.S. anti-money laundering laws and its profit and risk objectives. If these strategies are unsuccessful, or economic conditions or other conditions worsen in Venezuela or our regulators restrict the Bank from taking our Venezuelan customers\u2019 deposits, our deposits may decline. A significant or sudden decline in our deposits from Venezuelan customers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity.\nOur investment advisory and trust businesses could be adversely affected by conditions affecting our Venezuelan customers.\nAlthough we seek to increase our trust, brokerage and investment advisory business from our customers in our markets, substantially all our revenue from these services currently is from Venezuelan customers. Economic and other conditions in Venezuela, or U.S. regulations or sanctions affecting the services we may provide to our Venezuelan customers may adversely affect the amounts of assets we manage or custody, and the trading volumes of our Venezuelan customers, reducing fees and commissions we earn from these businesses.\nOur brokered deposits and wholesale funding increases our liquidity risk, could increase our interest rate expense and potentially increase our deposit insurance costs.\nOur brokered deposits at December 31, 2019 were 11.9% of total deposits. Wholesale funding, which includes FHLB advances and brokered deposits, represented 27.4% of our total funding at December 31, 2019. Our wholesale funding has increased 18.2% since 2016. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $530.0 million of FHLB advances with interest rates ranging from 0.71% to 0.97% which are callable prior to their maturity. This feature, if acted upon, could cause the cost of this funding to increase faster than anticipated. In addition, the FDIC adjusts its deposit insurance assessments by up to 10 basis points annually for institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more that have brokered deposits exceeding 10% of total deposits and where a bank also exceeds a certain risk level. In addition, excessive reliance on brokered deposits and wholesale funding is viewed by the regulators as potentially risky for all institutions, and may adversely affect our liquidity and the regulatory views of our liquidity. Institutions that are less than well-capitalized may be unable to raise or renew brokered deposits under the prompt corrective action rules. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Capital.\u201d\nTechnological changes affect our business including potentially impacting the revenue stream of traditional products and services, and we may have fewer resources than many competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, mainly provided by third party vendors, and a growing demand for mobile and other smart device and computer banking applications. In addition to allowing us to service our clients better, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs and the risks associated with fraud and other operational risks. Technological changes may impact our product and service offerings and may negatively affect the revenue stream of our traditional products and services (for example, potential negative impact of Zelle\u00ae on wire transfer fee income.) The largely unregulated Fintech industry has increased its participation in the lending and payments businesses, and has increased competition in these businesses. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that meet our customers\u2019 preferences and which create additional efficiencies in operations, while controlling the risk of cyberattacks and disruptions, and data breaches. Our strategic plan contemplates simplifying and improving our information technology, and making significant additional investments in technology. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly or at the costs anticipated. Furthermore, replacing third-party dependent solutions may also be time consuming and could potentially create disruptions with other already implemented solutions. Such technology may prove less effective than anticipated, and conversion issues may increase the costs of the new technology and delay its use. Many larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and, increasingly, non-banking firms are using technology to compete with traditional lenders for loans and other banking services. See \u201c-Operational risks are inherent in our businesses.\u201d\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions out of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt securities available for sale investment portfolio was approximately $1.6 billion and we had pretax accumulated unrealized gains on those securities of $9.6 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include but are not limited to increases or decreases in interest rates, rating agency downgrades of the securities and defaults.\nPotential gaps in our risk management policies and internal audit procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur enterprise risk management and internal audit program is designed to mitigate material risks and loss to us. We have developed and continue to develop risk management and internal audit policies and procedures to reflect ongoing reviews of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not identify every risk to which we are exposed, and our internal audit process may fail to detect such weaknesses or deficiencies in our risk management framework. Many of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior to model or project potential future exposure. Models used by our business are based on assumptions and projections. These models may not operate properly or our inputs and assumptions may be inaccurate, or may not be adopted quickly enough to reflect changes in behavior, markets or technology. As a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly different and greater than historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will closely follow our risk management policies and procedures, nor can there be any assurance that our risk management policies and procedures will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit timely our exposures based on our assessments. In addition, we may have to implement more extensive and perhaps different risk management policies and procedures under pending regulations, including regulations and policies applicable to U.S. commercial banks. All of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may determine that our internal controls and disclosure controls could have deficiencies or weaknesses.\nWe regularly review our internal controls for deficiencies and weaknesses. We have had no material weaknesses, but we have had deficiencies in the past. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d) such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although we seek to prevent, discover and promptly cure any deficiencies or weaknesses in ICFRs, as a relatively new public company, we may have material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future. If we are unable to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by law or Nasdaq rules. Failure to comply with the SEC internal controls regulations could also potentially subject us to investigations or enforcement actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. If we fail to implement and maintain effective ICFRs, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our periodic reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, suspension or delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Such events could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline and our access to the capital markets or other financing sources could be limited.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our reputation and subject us to financial sanctions and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious federal, state and foreign laws enforced by the bank regulators and other agencies protect the privacy and security of customers\u2019 non-public personal information. Many of our employees have access to, and routinely process, sensitive personal customer information, including through their access to information technology systems. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, the Company and its employees. It is possible that an employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. Such personal data could also be compromised by third-party hackers via intrusions into our systems or those of service providers or persons we do business with such as credit bureaus, data processors and merchants who accept credit or debit cards for payment. If we are subject to a successful cyberattack or fail to maintain adequate internal controls, or if our employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such cyberattacks, if they result from internal control inadequacies or non-compliance, could materially damage our reputation, lead to civil or criminal penalties, or both, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information systems may experience interruptions and security breaches, and are exposed to cybersecurity threats.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems, including those provided by third-party service providers, to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or security breach of these systems could result in failures or disruptions which could affect our customers\u2019 privacy and our customer relationships, generally. Our systems and networks, as well as those of our third-party service providers, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial institutions and their service providers are regularly attacked, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attack methods, including use of stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, structured query language injection attacks, and distributed denial-of-service attacks, among others. Such cyberattacks may also be directed at disrupting the operations of public companies or their business partners, which are intended to effect unauthorized fund transfers, obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, and we may be subject to these types of attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nDespite our cybersecurity policies and procedures and our efforts to monitor and ensure the integrity of our and our service providers\u2019 systems, we may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, nor may we be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies. These risks may increase in the future as the use of mobile banking and other internet-based products and services continues to grow.\nSecurity breaches or failures may have serious adverse financial and other consequences, including significant legal and remediation costs, disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, damage to systems operated by us or our third-party service providers, as well as damaging our customers and our counterparties. Such losses and claims may not be covered by our insurance. In addition to the immediate costs of any failure, interruption or security breach, including those at our third-party service providers, these events could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions and expansion activities may disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we may consider the acquisition of other businesses. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, banking centers, or businesses, as well as other geographic (domestic and international) and product expansion activities, involve various risks, including:\n\u2022\nrisks of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and delays;\n\u2022\nrisks that acquired new businesses will not perform consistent with our growth and profitability expectations;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new markets (domestic and international) or product areas where we have limited experience;\n\u2022\nrisks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties, expenses and delays in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired institutions or business generation teams;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions to our business;\n\u2022\npossible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;\n\u2022\npotential short-term decreases in profitability; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our existing operations and business.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWe expect that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we may believe is in our best interests. Additionally, regulatory approvals could contain conditions that reduce the anticipated benefits of a contemplated transaction. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital levels, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance, including anti-money laundering efforts, levels of goodwill and intangibles, management and integration capacity when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity per share of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, Florida law, and U.S. banking laws could have anti-takeover effects by delaying or preventing a change of control that you may favor.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Florida law, and the BHC Act, and Change in Bank Control Act, could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include certain provisions that could delay a takeover or change in control of us, including:\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board to fill any director vacancy;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022\nprovisions limiting the shareholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings of shareholders or to take action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could be used, among other things, to institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board.\nThe Florida Business Corporation Act contains a control-share acquisition statute that provides that a person who acquires shares in an \u201cissuing public corporation,\u201d as defined in the statute, in excess of certain specified thresholds generally will not have any voting rights with respect to such shares, unless such voting rights are approved by the holders of a majority of the votes of each class of securities entitled to vote separately, excluding shares held or controlled by the acquiring person.\nThe Florida Business Corporation Act also provides that an \u201caffiliated transaction\u201d between a Florida corporation with an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d as those terms are defined in the statute, generally must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares, other than the shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. The Florida Business Corporation Act defines an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d as any person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation.\nFurthermore, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act impose notice, application and approvals and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of bank holding companies, such as ourselves.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key people to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. We compete with other financial services companies for people primarily on the basis of compensation, benefits, the strength of the Company and the ability of the candidate to grow within the Company. Intense competition exists for key employees with demonstrated ability, and we may be unable to hire or retain such employees, including those needed to implement our business strategy. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel and failure to effectively transfer knowledge and smooth transitions involving key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business due to loss of their skills, knowledge of our business, their years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of timely finding qualified replacement employees. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified people to fill open key positions or replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. Rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements into which we may enter with certain of our employees and officers. In addition, proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act would prohibit the payment of \u201cexcessive compensation\u201d to our executives. Our regulators may also restrict compensation through rules and practices intended to avoid risks. These restrictions could negatively affect our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting and retaining key personnel.\nOur employees may take excessive risks which could negatively affect our financial condition and business.\nAs a banking enterprise, we are in the business of taking risks in the ordinary course of our operations. The employees who conduct our business, including executive officers and other members of management, loan originators, investment professionals, product managers, and other employees, do so in part by making decisions and choices that involve risks. We endeavor, in the design and implementation of our compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our employees incentives to take excessive risks; however, they may take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor employees business decisions and prevent them from taking excessive risks, and to prevent employee misconduct, these controls and procedures may not be effective. If our employees take excessive risks or avoid our policies and internal controls, their actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and business operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe and our subsidiaries are regulated by several regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, or CIMA. Our success is affected by regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies, and the securities markets, and our costs of compliance could adversely affect our earnings. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, not shareholders. The financial services industry also is subject to frequent legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact. From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations of us which, if not determined satisfactorily, could have a material adverse effect on us. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and costly and may affect our profitability.\nThe nature, effects and timing of administrative and legislative change, and possible changes in regulation or regulatory approach resulting from the 2020 general election cannot be predicted. The federal bank regulators and the Treasury Department, as well as the Congress and the President, are evaluating the regulation of banks, other financial services providers and the financial markets and such changes, if any, could require us to maintain more capital and liquidity, and restrict our activities, which could adversely affect our growth, profitability and financial condition. Our consumer finance products, including residential mortgage loans, are subject to CFPB regulations and evolving standards reflecting CFPB releases, rule-making and enforcement actions. If our assets grow to $10 billion or more, we will become subject to direct CFPB examination.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations are increasingly common in our businesses and may result in significant financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.\nWe face risks of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. We presently do not have any material pending litigation or regulatory matters affecting us.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant legal costs, divert management resources away from our business, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand on our existing business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees could be materially and adversely affected. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may also adversely affect the prices or volatility of our securities specifically, or the securities of our industry, generally.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards, and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are regulated as a bank holding company and are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements administered by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is subject to similar capital and liquidity requirements, administered by the OCC. The Basel III Capital Rules have increased capital requirements for banking organizations such as us. The Basel III Capital Rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital, or CET1, to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Basel III Capital Rules.\u201d We have established capital ratio targets that align with U.S. regulatory expectations under the fully phased-in Basel III Capital Rules. Although we have capital ratios that exceed all these minimum levels and a strategic plan to maintain these levels, we or the Bank may be unable to continue to satisfy the capital adequacy requirements for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nlosses and/or increases in our and the Bank\u2019s credit risk assets and expected losses resulting from the deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers and the issuers of equity and debt securities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in refinancing or issuing instruments upon redemption or at maturity of such instruments to raise capital under acceptable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the value of our securities or loan portfolios;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nrevisions to the regulations or their application by our regulators that increase our capital requirements;\n\u2022\nreductions in the value of our DTAs and other adverse developments; and\n\u2022\nunexpected growth and an inability to increase capital timely.\nAny failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d for bank regulatory purposes, including meeting the Basel III Capital Rule\u2019s conservation buffer, could affect customer confidence, and our:\n\u2022\nability to grow;\n\u2022\ncosts of and availability of funds;\n\u2022\nFDIC deposit insurance premiums;\n\u2022\nability to raise, rollover or replace brokered deposits;\n\u2022\nability to make acquisitions, open new branches or engage in new activities;\n\u2022\nflexibility if we become subject to prompt corrective action restrictions;\n\u2022\nability to make discretionary bonuses to attract and retain quality personnel;\n\u2022\nability to make payments of principal and interest on our capital instruments; and\n\u2022\nability to pay dividends on our capital stock.\nThe 2018 Growth Act provides that qualifying banks with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets that satisfy the \u201cCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio\u201d of 9%, are deemed to satisfy applicable risk based capital requirements necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d Though this provision may provide us relief from certain capital adequacy requirements in the future, we may be unable to qualify for such relief if our total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion or the federal banking agencies determine that our risk profile disqualifies us from such relief.\nOur operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable fiscal, monetary and political developments in the U.S. and other countries where we do business.\nOur businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal, monetary and other policies and actions of various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities. Changes in these are beyond our control and are difficult to predict and, consequently, changes in these policies could have negative effects on our activities and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to risks inherent in making loans and executing transactions with counterparties located in Latin America. Our domestic business, including loans, deposits and wealth management, services persons from or dependent upon businesses or wealth from Venezuela and other Latin American countries, and are, therefore, subject to risk inherent to those countries. These risks include, among others, effects from slow or negative growth or recessionary or worse economic conditions, inflation and hyperinflation, currency controls and volatility, and the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which such counterparties operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below.\nVarious countries or regions in which we, our counterparties or our customers operate or invest have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries and currency and exchange controls and other measures adopted by one country could cause other countries in the same region or beyond to experience a contraction of available credit, market and price volatility, illiquidity and reduced cross-border trading and financing activity.\nOur results of operations from international activities and customers from other countries may be subject to adverse changes as a result of the above considerations, as well as possible governmental actions, including expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, changes in laws and regulations and civil unrest and changes in government. The effects of these changes could be magnified in smaller, less liquid and more volatile foreign markets.\nConducting business and having customers in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes, or with currency controls, often requires devoting significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as compliance with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related risk policies and procedures. We can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating our businesses outside the U.S. to comply with U.S. anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and other laws, regulations and sanctions. Failure to comply with such rules in our international activities could adversely affect our results of operations and regulatory relations in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nChanges in accounting rules applicable to banks could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements. For example, the FASB\u2019s new requirements under CECL include significant changes to the manner in which banks\u2019 allowance for loan losses will be calculated at the effective date for such guidance. See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements, \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses.\u201d Instead of using historical losses, the new guidance will require forward looking analysis with respect to expected losses over the life of loans and other instruments, and could materially affect our results of operations, the volatility of such results and our financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act currently restricts our future issuance of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 risk-based capital for purposes of the regulatory capital guidelines for bank holding companies.\nBank holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, including us, are permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010 as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $89.1 million and $114.1 million, respectively, of trust preferred securities outstanding that were issued before May 19, 2010, and that have maturity dates between 2028 and 2036.\nShould we determine it is advisable, or should our regulators require us, to raise additional capital, we would not be able to issue additional trust preferred securities, as only bank holding companies with assets of less than $500 million are permitted to continue to issue trust preferred securities and include them as Tier 1 capital. Instead, we would have to issue non-cumulative preferred stock or common equity, which are Tier 1 capital. Subordinated notes meeting Basel III Capital Rules may be issuable as Tier 2 capital. To the extent we issue new equity or securities convertible into our outstanding Class A or Class B common stock, it could dilute our existing shareholders. Dividends on any preferred stock we may issue, unlike distributions paid on trust preferred securities, would not be tax deductible, and the preferred stock would have a preference in liquidation and in dividends to our common stock. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on favorable terms.\nWe anticipate that our current capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future under currently effective regulatory capital rules. We may, however, need to raise additional capital to support our growth or currently unanticipated losses, or to meet the needs of the communities we serve. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, among other things, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which may be limited by events outside our control, and on our financial performance. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be limited.\nWe will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements if our total assets grow in excess of $10 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our total assets were $8.0 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. Based on our current total assets and growth strategy, we anticipate our total assets may exceed $10 billion within the next five years. In addition to our current regulatory requirements, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are, among other things:\n\u2022\nexamined directly by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial laws;\n\u2022\nsubject to reduced dividends on the Bank\u2019s holdings of Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta common stock;\n\u2022\nsubject to limits on interchange fees pursuant to the \u201cDurbin Amendment\u201d to the Dodd-Frank Act which were not applicable to us in 2019 as a result of the Spin-off in 2018;\n\u2022\nsubject to enhanced prudential standards, to the extent not reduced or eliminated as a result of the 2018 Growth Act;\n\u2022\nsubject to annual Dodd-Frank Act self-administered stress testing, or DFAST, or similar stress testing, to the extent not reduced or eliminated by the 2018 Growth Act and our regulators; and\n\u2022\nno longer treated as a \u201csmall institution\u201d for FDIC deposit insurance assessment purposes.\nCompliance with these additional ongoing requirements may necessitate additional personnel, the design and implementation of additional internal controls, or the incurrence of other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our regulators requested us to engage in stress testing similar to DFAST before the Bank reached $10 billion in total assets, and we expect to continue such testing notwithstanding changes to the DFAST test thresholds by the 2018 Growth Act. Our regulators may also consider our preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements in the course of examining our operations generally or when considering any request from us or the Bank. It is unclear whether these expectations may change as a result of the 2018 Growth Act.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve, which examines us, expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act to require that all companies that control an FDIC-insured depository institution serve as a source of financial strength to the depository institution. Under this requirement, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress, even if further investment was not otherwise warranted. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe may face higher risks of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations than other financial institutions.\nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. In addition, FinCEN, which was established as part of the Treasury Department to combat money laundering, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of anti-money laundering rules. FinCEN has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS.\nAdditionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program, or CIP as part of its anti-money laundering program. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information must be verified within a reasonable time. On May 11, 2018, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule under the BSA requiring banks to identify and verify the identity of the natural persons behind their customers that are legal entities - the beneficial owners.\nThere is also regulatory scrutiny of compliance with the rules of the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or . OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, including sanctions against foreign countries, regimes and individuals, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Executive Orders have sanctioned the Venezuelan government and entities it owns, and certain Venezuelan persons. In addition, the OCC has broad authority to bring enforcement action and to impose monetary penalties if it determines that there are deficiencies in the Bank\u2019s compliance with anti-money laundering laws.\nMonitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and OFAC rules is complex and expensive. The risk of noncompliance with such rules can be more acute for financial institutions like us that have a significant number of customers from, or which do business in, Latin America. As of December 31, 2019, $2.3 billion, or 39.4%, of our total deposits were from residents of Venezuela. Our total loan exposure to international markets, primarily individuals in Venezuela and corporations in other Latin American countries, was $171.4 million or 2.98%, of our total loans, at December 31, 2019.\nIn recent years, we have expended significant management and financial resources to further strengthen our anti-money laundering compliance program. Although we believe our anti-money laundering and OFAC compliance programs, and our current policies and procedures and employees dedicated to these activities, are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations, and continued enhancements are ongoing, we cannot guarantee that our program will prevent all attempts by customers to utilize the Bank in money laundering or financing impermissible under current sanctions and OFAC rules, or sanctions against Venezuela, and certain persons there. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or fail to prevent violations of law or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and formal regulatory enforcement actions, including possible cease and desist orders, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, regulatory limitations on implementing certain aspects of our business plan, including acquisitions or banking center relocation or expansion, and require us to expend additional resources to cure any deficiency, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nFailures to comply with the fair lending laws, CFPB regulations or the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, could adversely affect us.\nThe Bank is subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA, and the Fair Housing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex and familial status in any aspect of a consumer, commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The DOJ and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending to provide guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists and how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders may take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. Failures to comply with ECOA, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including CFPB regulations, could subject us to enforcement actions or litigation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations. Our Bank is also subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) and periodic CRA examinations by the OCC. The CRA requires us to serve our entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our CRA ratings could be adversely affected by actual or alleged violations of the fair lending or consumer financial protection laws. Even though we have maintained an \u201coutstanding\u201d CRA rating since 2000, we cannot predict our future CRA ratings. Violations of fair lending laws or if our CRA rating falls to less than \u201csatisfactory\u201d could adversely affect our business, including expansion through branching or acquisitions.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac restructuring may adversely affect the mortgage markets.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship, and although legislation has been introduced at various times to restructure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to take them out of conservatorship and substantially change the way they conduct business in the future, no proposal has been enacted. Since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dominate the residential mortgage markets, any changes in their structure and operations, as well as their respective capital, could adversely affect the primary and secondary mortgage markets, and our residential mortgage businesses, our results of operations and the returns on capital deployed in these businesses.\nWe adopted a new accounting principle that requires immediate recognition in the statement of income of unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities, which includes mutual funds, increasing the volatility of our results of operations\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued changes to the guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The changes include, among others, the removal of the available-for-sale category for equity securities and the requirement to recognize changes in the fair value of these equity securities immediately through a charge or a credit to current period earnings. Previously, changes in fair value of equity securities included in the available for sale category were recognized in AOCI/AOCL, a component of our stockholders\u2019 equity. Under the new guidance, changes in fair value of these equity securities are now recognized directly in current period earnings which subjects the Company\u2019s periodic results to increased volatility resulting from fluctuations in the securities markets.\nFor example, as a result of the adoption in 2019 of this new guidance, we recorded in earnings a net gain of approximately $0.7 million, and reclassified accumulated after-tax unrealized losses of $0.9 million from accumulated other comprehensive income into retained earnings. Changes in the fair value of these equity securities, and of securities in general, are difficult to predict and could significantly impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Separation from the Former Parent\nWe changed our brand from \u201cMercantil\u201d to \u201cAmerant,\u201d which could adversely affect our business and profitability.\nSince 2007, we had marketed our products and services using variations of the Former Parent\u2019s \u201cMercantil\u201d brand name and logo. We rebranded our businesses as \u201cAmerant\u201d to distinguish our organization from our Former Parent.\nWe believe our association with the Former Parent provided us with greater name recognition among our customers from Latin America, including those with homes or businesses in the U.S., and the Former Parent\u2019s reputation and financial strength benefited us historically. The use of our new brand may result in potential loss of customer recognition and business.\nWe are incurring incremental costs as a separate, public company.\nAlthough we maintained separate systems and conducted operations largely with our own staff separate from the Former Parent and its other affiliates prior to the Spin-off, the Spin-off required us to incur additional personnel and other expenses as a standalone public company. Such expenses include, but are not limited to, SEC reporting, additional internal controls testing and reporting, and investor relations. We dedicated management time and costs, including the hiring and integration of certain new employees and changes in the manner of conducting certain functions. We may be unable to make the changes required in a timely manner and without unexpected costs, including possible diversion of management from our day-to-day operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a separate, public company, we spend additional time and resources to comply with rules and regulations that previously did not apply to us.\nAs a separate, public company, the various rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, where the Company Shares are listed, require us to implement additional corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements. Compliance with these public company obligations increases our legal and financial compliance costs and places additional demands on our finance, legal and accounting staff and on our financial, accounting and information systems.\nIn particular, as a separate, public company, our management is required to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal controls on this Form 10-K. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 5. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could adversely affect market prices of our Company Shares.\nOur historical consolidated financial data are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a separate company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nBecause we completed the Spin-off in August of 2018, our historical consolidated financial data included herein does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. We underwent a comprehensive strategic planning process to evaluate how we conduct business, including how to focus on our domestic U.S. business while better serving our valued foreign customers, reducing costs, and increasing core deposits, fee income, margins, and the number of services we provide per household and our profitability. As a result of these matters, among others, it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business.\nCertain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in the Former Parent or their positions with the Former Parent and us.\nThe Former Parent and the Company have one common director. This individual beneficially owns approximately 5.97% of the total outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, as of December 31, 2019. This person\u2019s family controls additional Company Shares. This individual, our former Chairman, who also is the Former Parent\u2019s Chairman, resigned as our Chairman effective December 31, 2018 but continues as a Company director. This relationship and financial interest may create actual or perceived conflicts of interest when this person is faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Former Parent and us. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the Former Parent and us.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few securities or industry analysts cover us, the trading price for our common stock may be adversely affected. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, or downgrades our common stock, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our Company shares will continue to trade. You should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky. The trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations and may be subject to fluctuations in the future. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant variations in response to, among other things, the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022\nquarterly or annual earnings and earnings expectations for our industry, and for us;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our Company Shares;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the Company and the banking industry;\n\u2022\nour profile, dividend policy or market capitalization may not fit the investment objectives of a large number of shareholders, many of whom are Venezuelans who became shareholders as a result of the Spin-off;\n\u2022\nevents affecting our shareholders in Venezuela, including hyperinflation and currency controls;\n\u2022\nthe intent of our shareholders, including institutional investors, to hold or sell their Company Shares;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock markets or in the values of financial institution stocks, generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, including banking laws and regulations, affecting our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company or industry. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, including recessions, loss of investor confidence, and interest rate changes, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nA limited market exists for the Company\u2019s shares of Class B common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. An active trading market may not develop or continue for the Company\u2019s shares of Class B common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and market volatility of those shares.\nThere is currently a limited market for shares of Class B common stock and there is no assurance that an active market will develop or be sustained. Although our Class B common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol \u201cAMTBB,\u201d respectively, trading volumes remain limited. If more active trading markets do not develop, you may be unable to sell or purchase shares of our Class B common stock at the volume, price and time that you desire.\nWhether or not the purchase or sale prices of our Class B common stock reflect a reasonable valuation of our Class B common stock may depend on an active trading market developing, and thus the price you receive for our Class B common stock, may not reflect its true or intrinsic value. Limited trading in our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our Class B common stock to be exaggerated from time to time, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market.\nCertain of our existing stockholders could exert significant control over the Company.\nAs of March 9, 2020, each of our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% holders of our Class A common stock beneficially owns outstanding shares representing, in the aggregate, approximately 28.33% of the outstanding shares of our voting Class A common stock (without giving effect to the broad family holdings of the Marturet and Vollmer families which will bring the percentage to an aggregate of approximately 40%.) As a result, these stockholders, if they act individually or together, may exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders and, accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements which we might not otherwise consider. This concentration of ownership of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or other transaction resulting in a change in control of the Company even when other stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial, and might adversely affect the market price of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding Company Shares.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests. In addition, we are authorized to issue up to 400 million shares of our Class A common stock and up to 100 million shares of our Class B common stock. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, up to 50 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, which may give other shareholders dividend, conversion, voting, and liquidation rights, among other rights, that may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, except as required by law or the Nasdaq Global Select Market, securities convertible into either common stock or preferred stock. Furthermore, we have adopted an equity compensation program for our employees, which also could result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests.\nWe expect to issue more Class A common stock in the future which may dilute holders of Class A common stock.\nFederal Reserve policy requires bank holding companies\u2019 capital to be comprised predominantly of voting common stock. Class B common stock is non-voting common stock for Federal Reserve purposes, therefore, we expect future issuances of Company Shares will be Class A common stock. These new issuances of Class A common stock, as well as their voting rights, may dilute the interests of our Class A shareholders, and increase the market for, and liquidity of, our Class A common stock generally, as compared to the market for, and liquidity of, our Class B common stock.\nHolders of Class B common stock have limited voting rights. As a result, holders of Class B common stock will have limited ability to influence shareholder decisions.\nGenerally, holders of our Class B common stock will be entitled to one-tenth of a vote, and vote together with holders of our Class A common stock on a combined basis, on approval of our auditors for a given fiscal year, if we present such a proposal for shareholder consideration. Our Class B common stock has no other voting rights, except as required by the Florida Business Corporation Act to vote as a voting group on any amendment, alteration or repeal of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, including any such events as a result of a merger, consolidation or otherwise that significantly and adversely affects the rights or voting powers of our Class B common stock. As a result, virtually all matters submitted to our shareholders will be decided by the vote of holders of our Class A common stock and the market price of our Class B common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur dual classes of Company Shares may limit investments by investors using index-based strategies.\nCertain major providers of securities indices have determined to exclude shares of companies with classes of common stock with different voting rights. These actions may limit investment in Company Shares by mutual funds, exchange traded funds, or ETFs, and other investors basing their strategies on such securities indices, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of Company Shares.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are afforded to emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we intend to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock prices may become more volatile. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth or improve our costs and capital structure. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the performance of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Our common stock could decline or increase in value.\nOur ability to pay dividends to shareholders in the future is subject to profitability, capital, liquidity and regulatory requirements and these limitations may prevent us from paying dividends in the future.\nCash available to pay our expenses and dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily from dividends paid to us by the Bank. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, will continue to be subject to and limited by the results of operations of the Bank and its subsidiaries and our need to maintain appropriate liquidity and capital at all levels of our business consistent with regulatory requirements and the needs of our businesses. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Dividend Restrictions.\u201d\nWe face strategic risks as an independent company and from our history as part of the Former Parent.\nAs an independent company, and from our history as part of the Former Parent, we face strategic risk. Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, liquidity, or franchise or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the competitive landscape of the banking and financial services industries in which we operate. We may have insufficient capital and insufficiently qualified personnel or culture to implement, as quickly as we seek, our strategy changes, including core deposit and fee income growth, improved margins, broader service to our customers, cost reductions and profitability increases.", "PERMNO": 18050, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AMTB"}
