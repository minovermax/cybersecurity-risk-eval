{"cik": "1432196", "company": "Pershing Gold Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nOur investors should consider the following risk factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe do not know if our properties contain any gold or other minerals that can be mined at a profit.\nThe properties on which we have the right to explore for gold and other minerals do not contain SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant mineral reserves and we do not know if any deposits of gold or other minerals can be mined at a profit. Whether a gold or other mineral deposit can be mined at a profit depends upon many factors. Some but not all of these factors include: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; operating costs and capital expenditures required to start mining a deposit; the availability and cost of financing; the price of the gold or other minerals which is highly volatile and cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. We are also obligated to pay production royalties on certain of our mineral production, including a net smelter royalty of 2% on production from most of our Relief Canyon Mine property, with a portion of the deposit located on property subject to net smelter return royalties totaling 4.5%, which would increase our costs of production and make our ability to operate profitably more difficult. We are also obligated to pay a net smelter royalty of up to 5% on production from some of our claims and lands.\nWe are an exploration stage company and have conducted exploration activities only since 2011. We reported a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018, and expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nOur evaluation of our Relief Canyon Mine property is primarily based on historical production data and on new exploration data that we have developed since 2011, supplemented by historical exploration data. Our plans for recommencing mining and processing activities at the Relief Canyon Mine property are still being developed, as are our exploration programs on the Relief Canyon expansion properties. Accordingly, we are not yet in a position to precisely estimate expected amounts of minerals, yields or values or evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. We have not earned any revenues from mining operations. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties and commencement of mining activities that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration, costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates and the requirement for external funding to continue our business. Prior to completion of our exploration stage, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We reported a net loss of approximately $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. Our monthly burn rate for all costs during 2018 was approximately $1.1 million, including $0.8 million for general and administrative costs (including all employee salaries, public company expenses, consultants, and land holdings costs) and $0.3 million for exploration activities. To pursue the commencement of mining and processing at Relief Canyon, additional external financing would be required. If we are unable to raise external funding, and eventually generate significant revenues from our claims and properties, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. We have no production history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is uncertain that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.\nExploring for gold and other minerals is inherently speculative, involves substantial expenditures, and is frequently non-productive.\nMineral exploration (currently our only business), and gold exploration in particular, is a business that by its nature is very speculative. We may not be able to establish mineral reserves on our properties or be able to mine any gold or any other minerals on a profitable basis. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Unusual or unexpected geological conditions, fires, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are just some of the many risks involved in mineral exploration programs and the subsequent development of gold deposits.\nThe mining industry is capital intensive and we may be unable to raise necessary funding.\nWe spent approximately $13.7 million on our business and exploration during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition to anticipated G&A and exploration costs in 2019, in order to commence mining at Relief Canyon, based on the estimates contained in the feasibility study, it would require capital expenditures and working capital expenditures of approximately $38 million. To pursue the commencement of production at Relief Canyon, additional external financing would be required. Such additional financing could include streaming, royalty financing, forward sale arrangements, debt offerings (including convertible debt), additional equity financing or other alternatives. In addition, even if we do not decide to pursue the commencement of production at Relief Canyon, we will be required to raise additional funds in order to finance our operations. We may be unable to secure additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to raise additional funds would prevent us from achieving our business objectives and would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our securities. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership of existing stockholders may be diluted and the securities that we may issue in the future may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of our common stock. Such securities may also be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock, resulting in possible further dilution to the book value per share of common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we could be subject to debt covenants that could place limitations on our operations and financial flexibility.\nUnanticipated problems or delays may negatively affect our ability to commence mining and processing activities at Relief Canyon.\nIf we were to decide to pursue the commencement of mining and processing activities at Relief Canyon, additional external financing would be required. Although the Relief Canyon Mine currently has an available leach pad and processing facility and we have senior mine and processing personnel in place, we would be required to obtain mining equipment (which could be through purchase, lease, contract mining or a combination of these), hire employees for the mine and the processing plant, purchase materials and supplies, commence mining, leaching and processing activities, and continue these activities as well as the corporate activities currently conducted for a number of months until sufficient positive cash flow is produced by gold sales to fund all of these ongoing activities. We may suffer significant delays or cost overruns as a result of a variety of factors, such as increases in the prices of materials, mining or processing problems, unanticipated variations in mined materials, shortages of workers or materials, transportation constraints, adverse weather, equipment failures, fires, damage to or destruction of property and equipment, environmental problems, unforeseen difficulties or labor issues, any of which could delay or prevent us from commencing or ramping up mining and processing. If our start-up were prolonged or delayed or our costs were higher than anticipated, we could be unable to obtain sufficient funds to cover the additional costs, and our business could experience a substantial setback. Prolonged problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations and threaten our viability.\nWe must make annual lease payments, advance royalty and royalty payments and claim maintenance payments or we will lose our rights to our property.\nWe are required under the terms of the leases covering some of our property interests to make annual lease payments and advance royalty and royalty payments each year. We are also required to make annual claim maintenance payments to the BLM and pay a fee to Pershing County in order to maintain our rights to explore and, if warranted, to develop our unpatented mining claims. If we fail to meet these obligations, we will lose the right to explore for gold and other minerals on our property. Our total annual property maintenance costs payable to the BLM and Pershing County for all of the unpatented mining claims and millsites in the Relief Canyon area in 2018 were approximately $220,000, and we expect our annual maintenance costs to be approximately $220,000 in 2019. Our lease payments, advance royalty and royalty payments and claim maintenance payments are described above under \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d on page 5.\nOur business is subject to extensive environmental regulations that may make exploring, mining or related activities prohibitively expensive, and which may change at any time.\nAll of our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that can substantially delay exploration and mine development and make exploration and mine development expensive or prohibit it altogether. We may be subject to potential liabilities associated with the pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products that may occur as the result of exploring and other related activities on our properties, including our plan to process gold at our processing facility. We may have to pay to remedy environmental pollution, which may reduce the amount of money that we have available to use for exploration, mine development, or other activities, and adversely affect our financial position. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or to enter into interim compliance measures pending the completion of the required remedy. If a decision is made to mine our properties and we retain any operational responsibility for doing so, our potential exposure for remediation may be significant, and this may have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial position. We have not purchased insurance for potential environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards associated with the disposal of waste products from our exploration activities) and such insurance may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at a reasonable price. All of our exploration and, if warranted, development activities will be subject to regulation under one or more local, state and federal environmental impact analyses and public review processes. It is possible that future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have significant impact on some portion of our business, which may require our business to be economically re-evaluated from time to time. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that regulatory authorities may increase bonding requirements beyond our financial capability. Inasmuch as posting of bonding in accordance with regulatory determinations is a condition to the right to operate under specific federal and state operating permits, increases in bonding requirements could prevent operations even if we are in full compliance with all substantive environmental laws. We have been required to post a substantial bond under various laws relating to mining and the environment and may in the future be required to post a larger bond to pursue additional activities. For example, we must provide BLM and the NDEP additional financial assurance (reclamation bonds) to guarantee reclamation of any new surface disturbance required for drill roads, drill sites, or mine expansion. In February 2018, we increased the amount of our reclamation bond with BLM and the NDEP to approximately $12.5 million. Approximately $12.4 million of our reclamation bond covers both exploration and mining at the Relief Canyon Mine property, including the three open pit mines and associated waste rock disposal areas, the mineral processing facilities, ancillary facilities, and the exploration roads and drill pads. Approximately $22,000 covers exploration on the Relief Canyon expansion properties. The reclamation bond was collateralized by approximately 30% of the $12.5 million bond amount, or about $3.7 million. Approximately $80,000 of the reclamation bond remains available for future mining or exploration operations. Our preliminary estimate of the likely amount of additional financial assurance for future exploration is approximately $100,000, although we expect periodic increases due to effects of inflation.\nThe government licenses and permits which we need to explore on our property may take too long to acquire or cost too much to enable us to proceed with exploration. In the event that we conclude that the Relief Canyon Mine deposit can be profitably mined, or we discover other commercially exploitable deposits, we may face substantial delays and costs associated with securing the additional government licenses and permits that could preclude our ability to develop the mine.\nExploration activities usually require the granting of permits from various governmental agencies. For example, exploration drilling on unpatented mining claims requires a permit to be obtained from the BLM, which may take several months or longer to grant the requested permit. Depending on the size, location and scope of the exploration program, additional permits may also be required before exploration activities can be undertaken. Prehistoric or Indian graves, threatened or endangered species, archeological sites or the possibility thereof, difficult access and excessive dust may all result in the need for additional permits before exploration activities can commence.\nIn June 2018, we submitted state and federal permit applications to expand the mine and the heap leach pad beyond the 21-million tons current capacity of the leach pad and to build an additional pond and waste rock storage areas to accommodate additional material. BLM may require an Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the associated impacts with the expansion proposed in these permit applications. As with all permitting processes, there is substantial uncertainty about when and if the permits will be issued. There is the risk that unexpected delays and excessive costs may be experienced in obtaining required permits. The needed permits may not be granted or could be challenged by third parties, which could result in protracted litigation that could cause substantial delays, or may be granted in an unacceptable timeframe or cost too much. While permitting efforts have not encountered opposition to date, proposed mineral exploration and mining projects can become controversial and be opposed by nearby landowners and communities, which can substantially delay and interfere with the permitting process. Delays in or inability to obtain the necessary permits discussed above would result in unanticipated costs, which may result in serious adverse effects upon our business.\nThe value of our property and any other deposits we may seek or locate is subject to volatility in the price of gold.\nOur ability to obtain additional and continuing funding, and our profitability if and when we commence mining or sell our rights to mine, will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of gold and other mineral deposits. Gold and other minerals prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control. The price of gold may be influenced by:\n\u00b7 fluctuation in the supply of, demand and market price for gold;\n\u00b7 mining activities of our competitors;\n\u00b7 sale or purchase of gold by central banks and for investment purposes by individuals and financial institutions;\n\u00b7 interest rates;\n\u00b7 currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 inflation or deflation;\n\u00b7 fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and other currencies;\n\u00b7 global and regional supply and demand, including investment, industrial and jewelry demand; and\n\u00b7 political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineral-producing countries.\nThe price of gold and other minerals have fluctuated widely in recent years, and a decline in the price of gold or other minerals could cause a significant decrease in the value of our property, limit our ability to raise money, and render continued exploration and development of our property impracticable. If that happens, then we could lose our rights to our property or be compelled to sell some or all of these rights. Additionally, the future development of our mining properties beyond the exploration stage is heavily dependent upon gold prices remaining sufficiently high to make the development of our property economically viable.\nOur property title may be challenged. We are not insured against any challenges, impairments or defects to our mining claims or title to our other properties.\nOur property is comprised primarily of unpatented lode mining claims and millsites located and maintained in accordance with the federal General Mining Law of 1872 (the \u201cGeneral Mining Law\u201d). Unpatented lode mining claims and millsites are unique U.S. property interests and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims and millsites is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations with which the owner of an unpatented mining claim or millsite must comply in order to locate and maintain a valid claim. Moreover, if we discover mineralization that is close to the claim boundaries, it is possible that some or all of the mineralization may occur outside the boundaries on lands that we do not control. In such a case we would not have the right to extract those minerals. We do not have title reports or opinions covering all of our Relief Canyon properties. The uncertainty resulting from not having title opinions for all of our Relief Canyon properties or having detailed claim surveys on all of our properties leaves us exposed to potential title defects. Defending challenges to our property title would be costly, and may divert funds that could otherwise be used for exploration activities and other purposes.\nIn addition, unpatented lode mining claims and millsites are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government, which, if successful, may prevent us from exploiting any discovery of commercially extractable gold. Challenges to our title may increase our costs of operation or limit our ability to explore on certain portions of our property. We are not insured against challenges, impairments or defects to our property title.\nPossible amendments to the General Mining Law and other environmental regulations could make it more difficult or impossible for us to execute our business plan.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the General Mining Law, as well as legislation that would make comprehensive changes to the law. Although no such comprehensive legislation has been adopted to date, there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If adopted, such legislation, if it includes concepts that have been part of previous legislative proposals, could, among other things, (i) limit on the number of millsites that a claimant may use, discussed below, (ii) impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of operation that may not coincide with mine life, (iii) impose more stringent environmental compliance and reclamation requirements on activities on unpatented mining claims and millsites, (iv) establish a mechanism that would allow states, localities and Native American tribes to petition for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation of the General Mining Law, (v) allow for administrative determinations that mining would not be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the federal lands in question could not be prevented, (vi) impose royalties on gold and other mineral production from unpatented mining claims or impose fees on production from patented mining claims, (viii) require conversion of mining claims to mining leases, and (ix) impose a fee on the amount of material displaced at a mine. Further, such legislation, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on earnings from our operations, could reduce estimates of any reserves we may establish and could curtail our future exploration and development activity on our unpatented claims.\nOur ability to conduct exploration, development, mining and related activities may also be impacted by administrative actions taken by federal agencies. With respect to unpatented millsites, for example, the ability to use millsites and their validity has been subject to greater uncertainty since 1997. In November of 1997, the Secretary of the Interior (appointed by President Clinton) approved a Solicitor\u2019s Opinion that concluded that the General Mining Law imposed a limitation that only a single five-acre millsite may be claimed or used in connection with each associated and valid unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Subsequently, however, on November 7, 2003, the new Secretary of the Interior (appointed by President Bush) approved an Opinion by the Deputy Solicitor which concluded that the mining laws do not impose a limitation that only a single five-acre millsite may be claimed in connection with each associated unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Current federal regulations do not include the millsite limitation. There can be no assurance, however, that the Department of the Interior will not seek to re-impose the millsite limitation at some point in the future.\nIn addition, a consortium of environmental groups has filed a lawsuit in the United District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the BLM, and the U.S. Forest Service (\u201cUSFS\u201d), asking the court to order the BLM and USFS to adopt the five-acre millsite limitation. That lawsuit also asks the court to order the BLM and the USFS to require mining claimants to pay fair market value for their use of the surface of federal lands where those claimants have not demonstrated the validity of their unpatented mining claims and millsites. If the plaintiffs in that lawsuit were to prevail, that could have an adverse impact on our ability to use our unpatented millsites for facilities ancillary to our exploration, development and mining activities, and could significantly increase the cost of using federal lands at our properties for such ancillary facilities.\nIn 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) announced that it would develop financial assurance requirements under CERCLA Section 108(b) for the hard rock mining industry. On January 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order requiring that if the EPA intended to prepare such regulations, it had to do so by December 1, 2016. The EPA did comply with that order by issuing draft proposed regulations on December 1, 2016. The EPA subsequently issued its proposed rule on January 11, 2017. Under the proposed rule, owners and operators of facilities subject to the rule have been required, among other things, to (i) notify the EPA that they are subject to the rule; (ii) calculate a level of financial responsibility for their facility using a formula provided in the rule; (iii) obtain a financial responsibility instrument, or qualify to self-assure, for the amount of financial responsibility; (iv) demonstrate that they had obtained such evidence of financial responsibility; and (v) update and maintain financial responsibility until the EPA released the owner or operator from the CERCLA Section 108(b) regulations. As drafted, those additional financial assurance obligations could have been in addition to the reclamation bonds and other financial assurances we have and would be required to have in place under current federal and state laws. If such requirements had been retained in the final rule, they could have required significant additional expenditures on financial assurance, which could have had a material adverse effect on the our future business operations.\nHowever, after an extended public comment period, the EPA issued a final rule on December 1, 2017 not to adopt the proposed rule, and not to impose additional financial assurance obligations on the hard rock mining industry. In 2018, a plaintiffs group comprised of several non-governmental organizations challenged EPA\u2019s final rule (Idaho Conservation League et al. v. Andrew Wheeler et al.).\nMarket forces or unforeseen developments may prevent us from obtaining the supplies and equipment necessary to explore for gold and other minerals.\nGold exploration, and mineral exploration in general, is a very competitive business. Competitive demands for contractors and unforeseen shortages of supplies and/or equipment could result in the disruption of our planned exploration activities. Current demand for exploration drilling services, equipment and supplies is robust and could result in suitable equipment and skilled manpower being unavailable at scheduled times for our exploration program. Fuel prices are extremely volatile as well. We will attempt to locate suitable equipment, materials, manpower and fuel if sufficient funds are available. If we cannot find the equipment and supplies needed for our various exploration programs, we may have to suspend some or all of them until equipment, supplies, funds and/or skilled manpower become available. Any such disruption in our activities may adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition.\nOur directors and executive officers lack significant experience or technical training in exploring for precious and base metal deposits and in developing mines.\nMost of our directors and executive officers lack significant experience or technical training in exploring for precious and base metal deposits and in developing mines. Accordingly, although our Chief Operating Officer has significant experience with mine operations, our management may not be fully aware of many of the other specific requirements related to working within this industry. Their decisions and choices may not take into account standard engineering or managerial approaches that mineral exploration companies commonly use. Consequently, our operations, earnings, and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to some of our management\u2019s lack of experience in the mining industry.\nWe may not be able to maintain the infrastructure necessary to conduct exploration activities.\nOur exploration activities and any future mine development activities depend upon adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important factors that affect capital and operating costs. Unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our exploration activities and financial condition.\nOur exploration activities and any future mine development may be adversely affected by the local climate or seismic events, which could prevent us from gaining access to our property year-round.\nEarthquakes, heavy rains, snowstorms, and floods could result in serious damage to or the destruction of facilities, equipment or means of access to our property, or may otherwise prevent us from conducting exploration activities on our property. There may be short periods of time when the unpaved portion of the access road is impassible in the event of extreme weather conditions or unusually muddy conditions. During these periods, it may be difficult or impossible for us to access our property, make repairs, or otherwise conduct exploration or mine development activities on them.\nRisks Relating to Our Organization and Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of the common stock may experience substantial volatility.\nThe trading price of our common stock may experience substantial volatility that is unrelated to our financial condition or operations. The trading price of our common stock may also be significantly affected by short-term changes in the price of gold and other minerals. The market price of our securities is affected by many other variables which may be unrelated to its success and are, therefore, not within our control. These include other developments that affect the market for all resource sector-related securities, the breadth of the public market for the common stock and the attractiveness of alternative investments. The effect of these and other factors on the market price of the common stock is expected to make the price of the common stock volatile in the future, which may result in losses to investors.\nWe have relied on certain stockholders to provide significant investment capital to fund our operations.\nWe have in the past relied on cash infusions primarily from Frost Gamma Investments Trust (\u201cFrost Gamma\u201d), Donald Smith, and one of our former directors, Barry Honig. During the year ended December 31, 2012, Frost Gamma provided approximately $4.6 million in consideration for the issuance of certain of our securities. In the year ended December 31, 2013, Mr. Honig provided approximately $5.6 million to us in consideration for the issuance of shares of our Series E Preferred Stock. Additionally, Mr. Honig and Frost Gamma provided approximately $1.9 million and $150,000, respectively, to us in consideration for the issuance of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock in July 2014 private placements. Mr. Honig invested $150,000 in a private placement of our common stock in October 2014, $2.5 million in an April 2015 private placement, $1.25 million in a February 2016 private placement, and $3.0 million in a December 2017 private placement. Mr. Smith invested $6 million in a March 2016 private placement. We can provide no assurances that these or any other significant investors will provide us with additional cash investments, which failure would detrimentally impact our cash availability and our ability to fund our operations.\nOur principal stockholders, officers and directors own a substantial interest in our voting securities, and investors may have limited voice in our management.\nOur principal stockholders, Barry Honig, Donald Smith, and Ruffer LLP (\u201cRuffer\u201d), as well as our officers and directors, own, in the aggregate, in excess of approximately 53.2% of our voting securities, including shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of our Series E Preferred Stock. As of April 1, 2019, Mr. Honig owned 13,269,621 shares, or approximately 36.0%, of our voting securities, Mr. Smith owned 3,257,930 shares, or approximately 8.8%, of our voting securities, and Ruffer owned 1,960,329 shares, or approximately 5.3%, of our voting securities. As of that date, our officers and directors owned 1,107,497, or approximately 3.0%, of our voting securities. Additionally, the holdings of our officers and directors may increase in the future upon exercise of options, warrants or convertible securities they may hold or be granted in the future or if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock, including through grants under our employee benefit plans.\nAs a result of their ownership and positions, our principal stockholder, directors and executive officers collectively may be able to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the following matters:\n\u00b7 election of our directors;\n\u00b7 amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws; and\n\u00b7 effecting or preventing a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction.\nIn addition, their stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nWe are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and other federal securities laws, as well as the listing rules of Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange (\u201cTSX\u201d).\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would have been if we were privately held. These costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 were approximately $650,000 and $625,000 respectively. We estimate that these costs will be approximately $625,000 for the year ending 2019.\nIt may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop, implement and maintain the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock and our ability to file registration statements pursuant to registration rights agreements and other commitments.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result of our small size, any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. Although, as of December 31, 2018, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will remain effective.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect these rules and regulations to further increase our compliance costs and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, we also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, and to maintain insurance at reasonable rates, or at all.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 results of our operations and exploration efforts;\n\u00b7 fluctuation in the supply of, demand and market price for gold;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 limited \u201cpublic float\u201d in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock and decline in demand for our common stock;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments;\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors;\n\u00b7 investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at a desired price.\nVolatility in the price of our common stock may subject us to securities litigation.\nAs discussed above, the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our common stock price appreciates.\nThere is currently a limited trading market for our common stock and we cannot ensure that one will ever develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is currently quoted on Nasdaq, the TSX, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our common stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so. Only a small percentage of our common stock is available to be traded and is held by a small number of holders and the price, if traded, may not reflect our actual or perceived value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity of our common stock is limited and may be dependent on the market perception of our business, among other things. We may, in the future, take certain steps, including utilizing investor awareness campaigns, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business and any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business and trading may be at an inflated price relative to the performance of our Company due to, among other things, availability of sellers of our shares. If a market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares for deposit in an account. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of low priced shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.\nSales, offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of the common stock, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for the common stock. A decline in the market prices of the common stock could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. If we were to decide to pursue the commencement of production at Relief Canyon, additional external financing would be required in addition to the amounts raised in our most recent offering and private placement. Such external financing could include streaming, royalty financing, forward sale arrangements, debt offerings (including convertible debt), additional equity financing or other alternatives, and may result in additional dilution to existing holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144, or upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could decline. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nThe conversion of preferred stock, a change in the conversion rate of preferred stock and exercise of options or warrants may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nConversions of our Series E Preferred Stock presently owned by our principal shareholders and others and exercise of options and warrants would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. As of March 27, 2019, we have reserved (i) 3,163,051 shares of our common stock that are issuable upon conversion of our Series E Preferred Stock at a conversion rate of one share of Series E Preferred Stock for approximately 353.571 shares of common stock (following an adjustment in the conversion ratio effective December 19, 2017), (ii) 1,383,671 shares of our common stock that are issuable upon exercise of options to purchase our common stock, (iii) 2,078,914 shares of our common stock that are issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock, and (iv) 968,549 shares of our common stock that are issuable pursuant to restricted stock units upon vesting and/or upon termination of service or in connection with a change of control. In the event that we sell or otherwise dispose of our common stock at an effective price less than $2.80, the conversion rate will be adjusted and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Series E Preferred Stock will increase. Further, any additional financing that we secure is likely to require the sale of additional common stock and the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and will result in additional dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common stockholders.\nOur issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock in exchange for services or to repay debt would dilute the proportionate ownership and voting rights of existing stockholders and could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors may generally issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock to pay for debt or services, without further approval by our stockholders, based upon such factors that our board of directors may deem relevant at that time. We have, in the past, issued securities for debt to reduce our obligations. We have also issued securities as payment for services. It is likely that we will issue additional securities to pay for services and reduce debt in the future. We cannot give you any assurance that we will not issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances we may deem appropriate at the time.\nOur articles of incorporation allow for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of our common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under our articles of incorporation and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our Company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur articles of incorporation contain provisions which eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our Company and stockholders. Our bylaws also require us to indemnify our officers and directors. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our agreements with our directors, officers and employees. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our Company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors, officers and employees that we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our Company from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers and employees for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors, officers and employees even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our Company and stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions may impede the acquisition of our Company.\nCertain provisions of the Nevada General Corporation Law have anti-takeover effects and may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with, and to obtain the approval of, our board of directors in connection with such a transaction. However, certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of us, including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result, stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so.\nNon-U.S. holders of our common stock, in certain situations, could be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon sale, exchange or disposition of our common stock.\nIt is likely that we are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes because our assets consist primarily of \u201cUnited States real property interests\u201d as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and applicable Treasury regulations. As a result, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, or FIRPTA, certain non-U.S. investors may or may in the future be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain from the disposition of shares of our common stock, in which case they would also be required to file U.S. tax returns with respect to such gain. In general, whether these FIRPTA provisions apply depends on the amount of our common stock that such non-U.S. investors hold. In addition, such non-U.S. investors may or may in the future be subject to withholding if, at the time they dispose of their shares, our common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. investor who has owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending on the date of disposition and (ii) the non-U.S. investor\u2019s holding period for its shares may or may in the future be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock under FIRPTA.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe Common Stock Exchange Ratio will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either our stock price or Americas Silver\u2019s share price.\nIn the Merger, each share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.715 of an Americas Silver common share (subject to adjustment as described herein). This Common Stock Exchange Ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either our common stock or Americas Silver common shares that have occurred subsequent to the execution date of the Merger Agreement, being September 28, 2018, or occur prior to the closing of the Merger. Changes in the price of Americas Silver common shares prior to completion of the Merger will affect the value of the consideration that our common stockholders will receive on the closing date of the Merger. Share price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond the control of Americas Silver and Pershing Gold), including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in Pershing Gold\u2019s and Americas Silver\u2019s respective businesses, operations, finances and prospects, or the market assessments thereof;\n\u00b7 market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed, including related considerations regarding regulatory approvals of the Merger; and\n\u00b7 general market and economic conditions, including fluctuations in the spot price of gold, silver or other precious metals and other factors generally affecting the price of our common stock and Americas Silver common shares.\nThe price of Americas Silver common shares at the closing of the Merger may vary from the price on the date the Merger Agreement was executed or on the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, the market value represented by the Common Stock Exchange Ratio will also vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of Americas Silver common shares on the NYSE American during the period from September 28, 2018, the last trading day completed before public announcement of execution of the Merger Agreement, through April 1, 2019, the Common Stock Exchange Ratio represented a market value ranging from a low of\u2009 $0.89 to a high of\u2009 $1.83 for each share of our common stock.\nOur stockholders will not know the exact market value of the Americas Silver common shares that they will receive or have a right to receive until completion of the Merger.\nIf the price of Americas Silver common shares increases prior to the closing of the Merger, our common stockholders will receive Americas Silver common shares that have a market value that is greater than the current market value of such shares. If the price of Americas Silver common shares decreases prior to the closing of the Merger, Our stockholders will receive Americas Silver common shares at closing that have a market value that is less than the current market value of such shares. Therefore, because the Common Stock Exchange Ratio will not be adjusted based on the market value of our common stock or Americas Silver common shares, Our stockholders cannot be sure at any given time of the market value of the consideration that will be paid to Our stockholders upon completion of the Merger.\nFurthermore, because Americas Silver Preferred Shares will be convertible into Americas Silver common shares, holders of Series E Preferred Stock who exchange their stock for Americas Silver Preferred Shares will not know the derivative value of their Americas Silver Preferred Shares until the closing of the Merger.\nThe Americas Silver Preferred Shares will not be listed on any stock exchange.\nHolders of Series E Preferred Stock may elect to receive Americas Silver Preferred Shares pursuant to the Merger. The Americas Silver Preferred Shares will not be listed on any exchange and there is currently no market through which the Americas Silver Preferred Shares may be sold. Holders of Series E Preferred Stock may, therefore, not be able to resell the Americas Silver Preferred Shares that they elect to receive in connection with the Merger. This may affect the price of the Americas Silver Preferred Shares in the secondary market (if one were to develop), the transparency and availability of trading prices and the liquidity of the Americas Silver Preferred Shares.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, Pershing Gold\u2019s ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Pershing Gold will be subject to a number of additional risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, in certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed by reason of certain circumstances attributable to Pershing Gold, Pershing Gold will be required to pay a break fee of\u2009 $4.0 million to Americas Silver;\n\u00b7 The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of the our common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed and that the related benefits will be realized, or as a result of the market\u2019s perceptions that the Merger was not consummated due to an adverse change in Pershing Gold\u2019s business or financial condition;\n\u00b7 Pershing Gold will continue to be liable to repay the amount outstanding under the Debenture to Americas Silver on the repayment dates agreed in the Debenture. Although in certain circumstances specified in the Debenture, each of Americas Silver and Pershing Gold may elect to convert the principal and interest amounts of the Debenture into shares of our common stock, in many circumstances Pershing Gold will be required to repay outstanding amounts in cash. There can be no certainty that Pershing Gold will have the financial capacity to repay the Debenture when due, or at all. If either Americas Silver or Pershing Gold elects to convert outstanding amounts under the Debenture into shares of our common stock, holders of our common stock will be diluted. In addition, conversion may trigger certain anti-dilution protections under the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock, further diluting holders of our common stock.\n\u00b7 Whether or not the Merger is completed, the pending Merger could adversely affect Pershing Gold\u2019s or Americas Silver\u2019s operations because matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by Pershing Gold\u2019s and Americas Silver\u2019s management and employees which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Pershing Gold or Americas Silver.\nPershing Gold and Americas Silver cannot guarantee when, or whether, the Merger will be completed, that there will not be a delay in the completion of the Merger or that all or any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger will be obtained. If the Merger is not completed or is delayed, Pershing Gold and/or Americas Silver may experience the risks discussed above which may adversely affect Pershing Gold\u2019s and/or Americas Silver\u2019s business, financial results and share price.\nThe application of interim operating covenants may restrict Pershing Gold\u2019s or Americas Silver\u2019s ability to pursue certain opportunities.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of Pershing Gold and Americas Silver has agreed to certain interim operating covenants intended to ensure that each of Pershing Gold and Americas Silver and their subsidiaries carry on business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, except as required or expressly authorized by the Merger Agreement or any applicable law, or unless the prior written consent of the other party is obtained. These operating covenants cover a broad range of activities and business practices. Consequently, it is possible that a business opportunity will arise that is out of the ordinary course or is not consistent with past practices, and that, as applicable, Pershing Gold or Americas Silver will not be able to pursue or undertake the opportunity due to its covenants in the Merger Agreement unless the prior written consent of the other party is obtained (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).\nThe rights of our stockholders who become shareholders of Americas Silver (\u201cAmericas Silver Shareholders\u201d) in the Merger will be governed by the Canada Business Corporations Act (the \u201cCBCA\u201d) and subject to Americas Silver\u2019s articles of incorporation, as amended (\u201cAmericas Silver Articles\u201d and Americas Silver bylaws (\u201cAmericas Silver Bylaws\u201d).\nOur stockholders who receive Americas Silver common shares in the Merger will become Americas Silver Shareholders. Americas Silver is a corporation existing under the laws of Canada. As a result, the rights of our stockholders who become Americas Silver Shareholders will be subject to the CBCA, the Americas Silver Articles and Americas Silver Bylaws, rather than being governed by the Nevada Revised Statutes and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended. There may be material differences between the current rights of our stockholders, as compared to the rights they will have as Americas Silver Shareholders.\nThese material differences may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nAmericas Silver had only one class of authorized shares, Americas Silver common shares, and in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Americas Silver Articles were amended to create the Americas Silver Preferred Shares, and under the Americas Silver Articles, Americas Silver\u2019s board of directors has the authority to issue an unlimited number of Americas Silver common shares;\n\u00b7\npursuant to the CBCA, at least 25% of the directors of Americas Silver must be resident Canadians;\n\u00b7\ndirectors of Americas Silver may be removed only by a majority vote of the shareholders of Americas Silver whereas Pershing Gold directors may be removed only by two-thirds of the voting power of the our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nour articles of incorporation require a majority of the voting power to repeal or amend certain provisions, while the Americas Silver Articles require 66 2\u22153 % of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, of the shares of Americas Silver to amend the Americas Silver Articles;\n\u00b7\nour bylaws provide that the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority (over 50%) of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of our stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the Merger of business while under the Americas Silver Bylaws, two shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, whether present in person or represented by proxy, and holding not less than 10% of the total number of the issued Americas Silver common shares, shall constitute a quorum; and\n\u00b7\nthe CBCA, being the corporate statute that governs Americas Silver, provides an oppression remedy that enables a court to make any order, including awarding money damages, appointing a receiver, dissolving the corporation, forcing the acquisition of securities and amending charter documents, to rectify matters that are oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or that unfairly disregard the interests of, any securityholder, creditor, director or officer of the corporation if an application is made to a court by a recognized complainant under the CBCA.\nRisks Relating to Americas Silver Following Completion of the Merger\nThe market price of the Americas Silver common shares has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of the Americas Silver common shares has fluctuated substantially, may continue to do so, and may be higher or lower than the initial price received upon the exchange. As a result, Americas Silver\u2019s future stock price may be volatile. Over the twelve-month period ending on April 1, 2019, the market price of Americas Silver common shares on the TSX has ranged from a low of C$1.67 to a high of C$5.09. Over the twelve-month period ending on April 1, 2019, the market price of the Americas Silver common shares on the NYSE American stock exchange has ranged from a low of\u2009 $1.24 to a high of\u2009 $4.30. The market price of the Americas Silver common shares following the Merger will depend on a number of factors many of which are beyond Americas Silver\u2019s control. These fluctuations could cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in the Americas Silver common shares since our stockholders might be unable to sell their shares at or above the price initially received upon the exchange of shares of our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of the Americas Silver common shares include the following:\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u00b7\nvolatility in the market prices and trading volumes of mining stocks and/or the spot price of gold and silver;\n\u00b7\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other precious or base metal mining companies generally, or those in Americas Silver\u2019s industry in particular;\n\u00b7\nfuture capital raising activities of Americas Silver;\n\u00b7\nsales of Americas Silver common shares by holders thereof;\n\u00b7\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of Americas Silver, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow Americas Silver, or Americas Silver\u2019s failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u00b7 the financial projections Americas Silver may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or Americas Silver\u2019s failure to meet those projections;\n\u00b7\nthe announcements by Americas Silver or its competitors of new projects or acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s reaction to Americas Silver\u2019s press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC and the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nrumors and market speculation involving Americas Silver or other companies in Americas Silver\u2019s industry;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in Americas Silver\u2019s operating results or fluctuations in Americas Silver\u2019s operating results;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated developments in Americas Silver\u2019s business, Americas Silver\u2019s competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u00b7\nlitigation involving Americas Silver, Americas Silver\u2019s industry or both, or investigations by regulators into Americas Silver\u2019s operations or those of Americas Silver\u2019s competitors;\n\u00b7\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses by Americas Silver or Americas Silver\u2019s competitors;\n\u00b7\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to Americas Silver and its business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7\nany significant change in Americas Silver\u2019s management; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of Americas Silver\u2019s markets.\nCurrent holders of our common stock will have reduced ownership and voting interests in Americas Silver after the Merger than they currently have in Pershing Gold.\nBased on 33,686,921 shares of our common stock and 968,549 shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to Pershing Gold RSUs outstanding on April 1, 2019, and the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, it is anticipated that Americas Silver will issue approximately 24,332,633 Americas Silver common shares to our current common stockholders and certain of our preferred stockholders who have elected to convert their Series E Preferred Stock to our common stock prior to completion of the Merger, and 3,678,135 shares of Americas Silver Preferred Shares to our preferred stockholders who have elected to receive such Americas Silver Preferred Shares (not including Americas Silver common shares issuable upon conversion of a Pershing Gold Warrant to be exchanged in the Merger or issuable pursuant to outstanding Pershing Gold RSUs). Based on the number of Americas Silver common shares outstanding as of March 4, 2019, current Americas Silver Shareholders and current Pershing Gold common stockholders would own approximately 65.1% and 34.9% of Americas Silver common shares, respectively, upon the completion of the Merger, assuming no additional issuances of Americas Silver common shares or shares of our common stock between the record date and the effective time of the Merger. However, Americas Silver could issue up to 8,286,615 Americas Silver common shares upon the exercise of outstanding Americas Silver warrants and Americas Silver options prior to the effective time. In addition, it is expected that Americas Silver will issue 692,512 Americas Silver common shares in exchange for the currently outstanding 968,549 Pershing Gold RSUs. In addition, up to 15,889 Americas Silver common shares may be issuable upon exercise of an existing Pershing Gold Warrant. Based on the current market price of our common stock, it is not expected that any Americas Silver common shares will be issuable in connection with the cancellation of other warrants or stock options issued by Pershing Gold.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote for the directors of Pershing Gold and on other matters affecting Pershing Gold. At the closing of the Merger, each of our stockholders who receives Americas Silver common shares will become a shareholder of Americas Silver. As a result, the percentage ownership of Americas Silver held by each of our current stockholders will be smaller than such stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership of Pershing Gold prior to the Merger. The current Pershing Gold stockholders will, therefore, have proportionately less ownership and voting interests in Americas Silver following the Merger than they have now in Pershing Gold.\nAny delay in completing the Merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder.\nIn addition to the required regulatory approvals and clearances, the Merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond Pershing Gold\u2019s or Americas Silver\u2019s control that may prevent, delay, or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. It is not predicable whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause our stockholders not to realize some or all of the synergies and other benefits that are expected to be achieved if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nUncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations following the Merger.\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, Americas Silver will be dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of Americas Silver and the continuing Pershing Gold officers and other key employees to execute its business plans. Americas Silver\u2019s success after the Merger will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Americas Silver\u2019s and Pershing Gold\u2019s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within Americas Silver following the Merger or other concerns regarding its operations following the Merger, any of which may have an adverse effect on Americas Silver\u2019s ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that Americas Silver and Pershing Gold will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees until the Merger is consummated or following the Merger to the same extent that Americas Silver and Pershing Gold have previously been able to attract or retain such employees.\nThe integration of Americas Silver and Pershing Gold may not occur as planned.\nThe Merger Agreement has been entered into with the expectation that its successful completion will result in increased precious metal production and an enhanced platform for growth for Americas Silver following completion of the Merger. These anticipated benefits will depend in part on whether Americas Silver\u2019s and Pershing Gold\u2019s operations can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of the two companies will present challenges to management, including the integration of systems and personnel of the two companies, and special risks, including possible unanticipated liabilities and unanticipated costs. As a result of these factors, it is possible that the cost reductions and synergies expected from the Merger will not be realized by Americas Silver. In addition, such synergies assume certain realized long-term metals prices and foreign exchange rates. If actual prices are below such assumed prices, the realization of potential synergies could be adversely affected.\nAmericas Silver and Pershing Gold may not realize the benefits of the Merger currently anticipated due to challenges associated with integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of Americas Silver and Pershing Gold.\nThe anticipated success of Americas Silver with respect to the Merger will depend in large part on the success of management of Americas Silver in integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of Pershing Gold with those of Americas Silver. The failure of Americas Silver to successfully integrate Pershing Gold, or the occurrence of any unanticipated operational problems or interruptions, expenses and liabilities could result in the failure of Americas Silver to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger and could impair the results of operations, profitability and financial results of Americas Silver.\nThe overall integration of the operations, technologies and personnel of Pershing Gold into Americas Silver may also result in unanticipated operational problems, expenses, liabilities and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. There can be no assurance that Pershing Gold or Americas Silver will not incur additional material costs in subsequent periods to reflect additional costs associated with the Merger or that the benefits of the Merger will be realized.\nThe obligations and liabilities of Pershing Gold, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, may be greater than anticipated, which may diminish the value of Pershing Gold to Americas Silver.\nPershing Gold\u2019s obligations and liabilities, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, or may be greater than anticipated, may not be reflected or reserved for in Pershing Gold\u2019s historical financial statements. The obligations and liabilities of Pershing Gold could have a material adverse effect on Pershing Gold\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations following the Merger. Americas Silver will not be able to realize any indemnification from Pershing Gold under the Merger Agreement with respect to obligations or liabilities of Pershing Gold, whether known or unknown. Any such liabilities could substantially reduce Americas Silver\u2019s earnings and cash flows or otherwise materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations following the Merger.\nAdditional reporting requirements may apply if Americas Silver loses its status as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under the Exchange Act.\nAmericas Silver is currently considered a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under the rules of the SEC. However, following completion of the Merger it is may lose its \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d status at future assessment dates. As a foreign private issuer, Americas Silver is subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. Americas Silver is required to file its annual report on Form 40-F with the SEC at the time it files its annual information form with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities. In addition, Americas Silver must furnish reports on Form 6-K to the SEC regarding certain information required to be publicly disclosed by Americas Silver in Canada or filed with the TSX and which was made public by the TSX, or regarding information distributed or required to be distributed by Americas Silver to its shareholders. Moreover, although Americas Silver is required to comply with Canadian disclosure requirements, in some circumstances Americas Silver is not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. Americas Silver is required to file financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and therefore does not file financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as do U.S. companies that file reports with the SEC. Furthermore, Americas Silver is not required to comply with the U.S. proxy rules or with Regulation FD, which addresses certain restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information, although it must comply with Canadian disclosure requirements. In addition, among other matters, Americas Silver\u2019s officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and \u201cshort-swing\u201d profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of Americas Silver common shares. Americas Silver also presents information regarding mineral resources and reserves in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101\u2009-\u2009Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) rather than SEC Industry Guide 7 with which U.S. companies must comply. If Americas Silver loses its status as a foreign private issuer, it will no longer be exempt from such rules and, among other things, will be required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the content and in the form permitted as if it were a U.S. company, and incur additional costs to make such filings. Americas Silver does, however, file quarterly financial information under Canadian periodic reporting requirements for public corporations, which is accessible through the Internet at www.sedar.com, and will furnish such quarterly financial information to the SEC under cover of Form 6-K, which is available at www.sec.gov. Insiders of Americas Silver are generally required to disclose their trading in Americas Silver common shares within 5 days of the date of the trade and these trading activity reports can be accessed through the Internet at www.sedi.ca.\nPershing Gold and Americas Silver expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger and the integration of the two companies.\nAmericas Silver and Pershing Gold expect to incur significant transaction costs and significant synergy planning and integration costs in connection with the Merger. While Americas Silver has assumed that this level of expense will be incurred, there are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the Merger and integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. To the extent these Merger and integration expenses are higher than anticipated or are incurred at different times than anticipated, Americas Silver\u2019s future operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nAmericas Silver may be subject to significant capital requirements and operating risks associated with its expanded operations and its expanded portfolio of growth projects.\nAmericas Silver must generate sufficient internal cash flows and/or be able to utilize available financing sources to finance its growth and sustaining capital requirements. If Americas Silver does not realize satisfactory prices for the commodities that it produces, it could be required to raise significant additional capital through the capital markets and/or incur significant borrowings to meet its capital requirements. These financing requirements could adversely affect Americas Silver\u2019s ability to access the capital markets in the future to meet any external financing requirements Americas Silver might have. If there are significant delays in terms of when any exploration, development and/or expansion projects are completed and producing on a commercial and consistent scale, and/or their capital costs were to be significantly higher than estimated, these events could have a significant adverse effect on Americas Silver\u2019s results of operation, cash flow from operations and financial condition.\nAmericas Silver may need additional financing in connection with the implementation of its business and strategic plans from time to time after closing of the Merger. The exploration and development of mineral properties, including Relief Canyon, and the ongoing operation of mines require a substantial amount of capital and may depend on Americas Silver\u2019s ability to obtain financing through joint ventures, debt financing, equity financing or other means. The combined entity may accordingly need further capital depending on exploration, development, production and operational results and market conditions, including the prices at which Americas Silver sells its production, or in order to take advantage of further opportunities or acquisitions. Americas Silver\u2019s financial condition, general market conditions, volatile metals markets, volatile interest rates, a claim against Americas Silver, a significant disruption to Americas Silver\u2019s business or operations or other factors may make it difficult to secure financing necessary for the expansion of mining activities or to take advantage of opportunities for acquisitions. Further, continuing volatility in the credit markets may affect the ability of Americas Silver, or third parties it seeks to do business with, to access those markets. There is no assurance that Americas Silver will be successful in obtaining required financing as and when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. If Americas Silver raises funding by issuing additional equity securities or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for equity securities, such financing may substantially dilute the interests of the shareholders of Americas Silver and reduce the value of their investment.\nIn addition, Americas Silver\u2019s mining operations and processing and related infrastructure facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the mining and metals industry. Such risks include, without limitation, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, labor disputes, changes in laws, technical difficulties or failures, late delivery of supplies or equipment, unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures, cave-ins, pit-wall failures, rock falls, unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions, flooding, periodic or extended interruptions due to the unavailability of materials and force majeure events. Such risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or producing facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses and possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at Americas Silver\u2019s mining or processing operations could materially adversely affect Americas Silver\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. See the information under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Americas Silver\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis filed as an Exhibit to its Form 6-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on March 4, 2019.\nLabor relations, employee recruitment, retention and pension funding issues may adversely affect Americas Silver\u2019s operations.\nAmericas Silver may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its operations. Americas Silver is dependent on its workforce at its material producing properties and mills. Americas Silver endeavors to maintain good relations with its workforce in order to minimize the possibility of strikes, lock-outs and other stoppages at the site. Relations between Americas Silver and its employees may be impacted by changes in labor relations which may be introduced by, among other things, employee groups, competing labor unions, and the relevant governmental authorities in whose jurisdictions Americas Silver carries on business. Many of Americas Silver\u2019s employees at its operations are represented by a labor union under a collective labor agreement. Americas Silver may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate the collective labor agreement when it expires. In addition, the existing labor agreement may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Americas Silver\u2019s facilities in the future, and any such work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on its earnings.\nAmericas Silver also hires its employees or consultants in Mexico to assist it in conducting its operations in accordance with Mexican laws. Americas Silver also purchases certain supplies and retains the services of various companies in Mexico to meet its business plans. It may be difficult to find or hire qualified people in the mining industry who are situated in Mexico or to obtain all the necessary services or expertise in Mexico or to conduct operations on its projects at reasonable rates. If qualified people and services or expertise cannot be obtained in Mexico, Americas Silver may need to seek and obtain those services from people located outside Mexico, which will require work permits and compliance with applicable laws and could result in delays and higher costs to Americas Silver to conduct its operations in Mexico. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to Americas Silver\u2019s success. The number of persons skilled in acquisition, exploration and development of mining properties is limited and competition for such persons is intense. As Americas Silver\u2019s business activity grows, Americas Silver will require additional key executive, financial, operational, administrative and mining personnel. Although Americas Silver believes that it will be successful in attracting, training and retaining qualified personnel, there can be no assurance of such success. If Americas Silver is not successful in attracting and training qualified personnel, the efficiency of its operations could be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on Americas Silver\u2019s results of operations and profitability. Americas Silver strongly depends on the business and technical expertise of its small group of management and key personnel. There is little possibility that this dependence will decrease in the near term. Key man life insurance is not in place on management and key personnel. If the services of Americas Silver\u2019s management and key personnel were lost, it could have a material adverse effect on future operations.\nThe volatility in the equity markets over the last several years and other financial impacts have affected Americas Silver\u2019s costs and liquidity through increased requirements to fund Americas Silver\u2019s defined benefit pension plans for its employees. There can be no assurance that financial markets will sufficiently recover in the future with the effect of causing a corresponding reduction in Americas Silver\u2019s future pension funding requirements. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that unforeseen changes in pensioner longevity, government regulation or other financial market uncertainties will not cause pension funding requirements to differ from the requirements projected by professional actuaries. Americas Silver intends to continue to fund its pension plan for hourly and salary employees of Americas Silver pursuant to all relevant regulatory requirements.\nAmericas Silver\u2019s future results will suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the Merger.\nFollowing the Merger, the size of Americas Silver\u2019s business will increase significantly. Its future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations, and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that Americas Silver will be successful following the Merger.\nThe market price of Americas Silver common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting Americas Silver common shares or our common stock prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nAmericas Silver\u2019s mining methods and historical business differ from that of Pershing Gold. Accordingly, the results of operations of Americas Silver following completion of the Merger and the market price of Americas Silver common shares may be affected by factors different from those that previously affected the independent results of operations and the market price of the Americas Silver common shares or our common stock. The ability to produce, and level and timing of production at Americas Silver\u2019s existing mines are different from those of Pershing Gold. These differences may lead to different production profiles in different price scenarios from Americas Silver\u2019s production facilities, which could lead to adverse impacts on the market price for Americas Silver common shares.\nAmericas Silver is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and Americas Silver and Pershing Gold cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make Americas Silver common shares less attractive to investors.\nAmericas Silver is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, whereas Pershing Gold is not an emerging growth company. Americas Silver will continue to qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of: (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which Americas Silver has total annual gross revenues of US$1.07 billion or more; (b) the last day of the fiscal year of Americas Silver following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of Americas Silver pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, such as this proxy statement/prospectus; (c) the date on which Americas Silver has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than US$1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (d) the date on which Americas Silver is deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d.\nFor so long as Americas Silver continues to qualify as an emerging growth company, it will be exempt from the requirement to include an auditor attestation report relating to internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in its annual reports filed under the Exchange Act, even if it does not qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d. In addition, section 103(a)(3) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has been amended by the JOBS Act to provide that, among other things, auditors of an emerging growth company are exempt from any rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the registrant (auditor discussion and analysis).\nAny U.S. domestic issuer that is an emerging growth company is able to avail itself of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and to not present to its stockholders a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, obtain approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, or present the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and such issuer\u2019s financial performance. In contrast, Pershing Gold is currently subject to all of these requirements. As a foreign private issuer, Americas Silver is not subject to such requirements, and will not become subject to such requirements even if Americas Silver ceases to be an emerging growth company, unless Americas Silver also ceases to be a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d.\nUntil Americas Silver ceases to be an emerging growth company Americas Silver may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. Investors in Pershing Gold who are familiar with Pershing Gold\u2019s reporting regime, may find Americas Silver common shares less attractive because Americas Silver relies on these exemptions. If some of Pershing Gold\u2019s investors find Americas Silver common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Americas Silver common shares and Americas Silver common share price may be more volatile.\nSection 7874 of the Code may limit the ability of Pershing Gold, and U.S. persons related to Pershing Gold, to utilize certain U.S. tax attributes to offset certain U.S. taxable income, if any, generated by the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or certain specified transactions for a period of time following the Merger.\nSection 7874 of the Code may limit the ability of a U.S. corporation acquired by a foreign corporation, and U.S. persons related to the acquired U.S. corporation, to utilize certain U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset certain U.S. taxable income. Specifically, if the stockholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own, following an acquisition by a foreign corporation, at least 60%, but less than 80%, measured either by vote or by value, of the shares of the acquiring foreign corporation, the taxable income of the acquired U.S. corporation (and any U.S. person related to the U.S. corporation) for any given year, within a ten-year period beginning on the date of the acquisition will be no less than that person\u2019s \u201cinversion gain\u201d for that taxable year. A person\u2019s inversion gain includes gain from the transfer of shares, or any other property (other than property held for sale to customers), and income from the license of any property that is either transferred or licensed as part of the acquisition, or that is transferred or licensed to a non-U.S. related person after the acquisition.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to changes in the current share prices of Americas Silver common shares and shares of our common stock with respect to outstanding Pershing Gold and Americas Silver options and warrants, our stockholders are expected to own less than 60% of the vote and value of Americas Silver common shares after the Merger. As a result, under current law, we and U.S. persons related to us are not expected to be subject to such limitations on the use of U.S. tax attributes. However, there can be no assurance that there will not exist in the future a change in the facts or in the law that might cause us to be subject to such limitations, including with retroactive effect. Further, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the position that the 60% ownership requirement is not satisfied.\nRecent and future changes to U.S. tax laws could materially adversely affect us and Americas Silver.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law and significantly revised the Code. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other things, reduces the backup withholding tax rate from 28% to 24% and contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), implementation of a \u201cbase erosion anti-abuse tax\u201d which requires U.S. corporations to make an alternative determination of taxable income without regard to tax deductions for certain payments to affiliates, taxation of certain non-U.S. corporations\u2019 earnings considered to be \u201cglobal intangible low taxed income\u201d repeal of the alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) for corporations and changes to a taxpayer\u2019s ability to either utilize or refund the AMT credits previously generated, revision in the attribution rules relating to shareholders of certain \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or elimination of many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is uncertain, and Pershing Gold or Americas Silver\u2019s business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on holders of Americas Silver common shares after the Merger is also uncertain and could be adverse. For example, recent changes in federal income tax law resulting in additional taxes owed by U.S. shareholders related to \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d may discourage U.S. investors from owning or acquiring (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or greater of outstanding Americas Silver common shares, which other shareholders may have viewed as beneficial or may otherwise negatively impact the trading price of Americas Silver common shares. Pershing Gold and Americas Silver are unable to predict what U.S. federal tax law may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on Pershing Gold or Americas Silver\u2019s business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect Americas Silver\u2019s effective tax rates in the future where it has operations and have an adverse effect on its overall tax rate in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. Our stockholders are urged to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding Americas Silver common shares.\nIf Americas Silver is, or becomes, a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences may result for U.S. shareholders of Americas Silver\nU.S. holders of Americas Silver common shares or Americas Silver Preferred Shares should be aware that Americas Silver believes it was not classified as a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) for its tax year ended December 31, 2017, and based on current business plans and financial expectations, Americas Silver expects that it will not be a PFIC for the current tax year. Americas Silver has not made any determination as to its PFIC status for future tax years. PFIC classification is fundamentally factual in nature, generally cannot be determined until the close of the tax year in question, and is determined annually. Consequently, there can be no assurance that Americas Silver will not become a PFIC for any tax year during which U.S. holders own Americas Silver shares.\nIf Americas Silver is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period, then such U.S. holder generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of Americas Silver common shares or Americas Silver Preferred Shares, or any \u201cexcess distribution\u201d received on its Americas Silver common shares, as ordinary income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or distribution, unless the U.S. holder makes a timely and effective \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d election (\u201cQEF Election\u201d) or a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d election with respect to its Americas Silver common shares or Americas Silver Preferred Shares. A U.S. holder who makes a QEF Election generally must report on a current basis its share of Americas Silver\u2019s net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which Americas Silver is a PFIC, whether or not Americas Silver distributes any amounts to its shareholders. However, U.S. holders should be aware that there can be no assurance that Americas Silver will satisfy the record keeping requirements that apply to a QEF, or that Americas Silver will supply U.S. holders with information that such U.S. holders require to report under the QEF Election rules, in the event that Americas Silver is a PFIC and a U.S. holder wishes to make a QEF Election. Thus, U.S. holders may not be able to make a QEF Election with respect to their Americas Silver common shares or Americas Silver Preferred Shares. A U.S. holder who makes a mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the Americas Silver common shares or Americas Silver Preferred Shares over the taxpayer\u2019s basis therein. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger and the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Americas Silver common shares or Americas Silver Preferred Shares.\nThe Merger is expected to result in an ownership change for Pershing Gold under Section 382 of the Code, potentially limiting the use of Pershing Gold\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in future years. In addition, Pershing Gold\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Pershing Gold had approximately $88.6 million of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards available to reduce U.S. federal taxable income in future years. Under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.\nThe Merger is expected to result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code for Pershing Gold, potentially limiting the use of Pershing Gold\u2019s NOL carryforwards in future taxable years for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These limitations may affect the timing of when these NOL carryforwards can be used which, in turn, may impact the timing of when cash is used to pay the taxes of Pershing Gold and have a negative impact on Pershing Gold\u2019s financial position and results of operations. In addition, Pershing Gold\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will be dependent on its ability to generate taxable income.\nThe applicable Canadian and U.S. income tax laws may be changed or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to Americas Silver and its securityholders following completion of the Merger.\nThere can be no assurance that the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d), the IRS or other applicable taxing authorities will agree with the Canadian and U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, as applicable, as set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that applicable Canadian and U.S. income tax laws, regulations or tax treaties will not be changed or interpreted in a manner, or that applicable taxing authorities will not take administrative positions, that is adverse to Americas Silver and its securityholders following completion of the Merger. Such taxation authorities may also disagree with how Americas Silver or Pershing Gold calculate or have in the past calculated their income for income tax purposes. Any such events could adversely affect Americas Silver, its share price or the dividends or other payments to be paid to Americas Silver\u2019s securityholders following completion of the Merger.\nThe issuance of a significant number of Americas Silver common shares and resulting \u201cmarket overhang\u201d could adversely affect the market price of Americas Silver common shares after completion of the Merger.\nOn completion of the Merger, a significant number of additional Americas Silver common shares will be available for trading in the public market. The increase in the number of Americas Silver common shares may lead to sales of such Americas Silver common shares or the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market price of, Americas Silver Common Shares. The potential that an Americas Silver common shareholder may sell its Americas Silver common shares in the public market (commonly referred to as \u201cmarket overhang\u201d), as well as any actual sales of Americas Silver common shares in the public market, could adversely affect the market price of the Americas Silver common shares.", "PERMNO": 15538, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "PGLC"}
